DISTRIBUTION FILES -

This CD contains the following files & directories
     (assuming your CD-ROM drive is drive D):
D:\ [root directory]
        (These files are not included with internet distribution.)
     start.htm
        This file contains a menu of start-up options which should enable 
        most CD users to begin using "the Book" very quickly and easily.
     readme.txt
        The file you are reading now.
D:\the_BOOK\
     go_Book.htm
        Open this file in a browser to Start the program.
     readme.txt
        The file you are reading now.
        (This file is identical to the one in the Root Directory.)
D:\the_BOOK\the_Book\
     This sub-directory contains all files for program operation. 
     To facilitate electronic distribution (eg., from other websites) 
     all files for "The Book" are contained in one large directory 
     (approx. 10.5 MB). The entire program is written in HTML and is 
     compatible with most internet browsers. 
     The start file is: go_bible.htm (See the .Zip file instructions below.)

     Of course, you may add a link from your site to our site. Sample link: 
     <a href="http://www.thebookwurm.com/go_bible.htm">Link to The Book</a> 

D:\Zip\   This directory contains the following file:
    the_Book.zip  - 
      This file contains the contents of the D:\the_BOOK\the_Book 
    directory and sub-directory in a compressed format. These files could be 
    uploaded to bulletin board websites for other users to download. 
    File size is about 5.5 MB (compressed) and 15 MB (decompressed).
  
      The .ZIP file must be decompressed with a utility program such as 
    PKUNZIP or WinZip. You will need to create a directory (folder) such as 
    C:\THE_BOOK and decompress the .ZIP file into this directory. 
      To start the program, click on the file Go_Book.HTM in the parent 
    directory (C:\the_BOOK\...). This start file is provided in the parent 
    directory to make it easier to find. 
      For frequent access to the program on your harddrive, you may wish 
    to bookmark this file on your Browser's list of 'favorites'.

    Alternately, the program can be started by clicking on the start file 
    in the program sub-directory (C:\the_BOOK\the_Book\go_Bible.htm). 
    This start file is provided to allow all program files to reside within 
    one directory, as required by some website hosts. The link to the 
    on-line version of "The Book" (above) provides an example of using this 
    start file for internet publication of this program.

    Note 1.: These two start files are internally different and cannot be 
       interchanged. Observe that their names also differ.

    Note 2.: Upper case letters are used for visual distinction between 
       file names in the discussion above. However, for internet publication,
       all file names should be in lower case only (for example:
       Go_Bible.htm should be go_bible.htm). Most FTP programs can be set 
       to force lower case file names during the upload process.
