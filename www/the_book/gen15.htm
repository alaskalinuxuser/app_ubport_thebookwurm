After these things the word of the LORD came unto Abram in a vision, saying, Fear not, Abram: I [am] thy shield, [and] thy exceeding great reward.<br><a name="2">2</a>. And Abram said, Lord GOD, what wilt thou give me, seeing I go childless, and the steward of my house [is] this Eliezer of Damascus?<br><a name="3">3</a>  And Abram said, Behold, to me thou hast given no seed: and, lo, one born in my house is mine heir.<br><a name="4">4</a>  And, behold, the word of the LORD [came] unto him, saying, This shall not be thine heir; but he that shall come forth out of thine own bowels shall be thine heir.<br><a name="5"> 5</a>  And he brought him forth abroad, and said, Look now toward heaven, and tell the stars, if thou be able to number them: and he said unto him, So shall thy seed be.<br><a name="6">6</a>  And he believed in the LORD; and he counted it to him for righteousness.<br><a name="7">7</a>. And he said unto him, I [am] the LORD that brought thee out of Ur of the Chaldees, to give thee this land to inherit it.<br><a name="8">8</a>  And he said, Lord GOD, whereby shall I know that I shall inherit it?<br><a name="9">9</a>  And he said unto him, Take me an heifer of three years old, and a she goat of three years old, and a ram of three years old, and a turtledove, and a young pigeon.<br><a name="10">10</a>  And he took unto him all these, and divided them in the midst, and laid each piece one against another: but the birds divided he not.<br><a name="11">11</a>  And when the fowls came down upon the carcases, Abram drove them away.<br><a name="12">12</a>. And when the sun was going down, a deep sleep fell upon Abram; and, lo, an horror of great darkness fell upon him.<br><a name="13">13</a>  And he said unto Abram, Know of a surety that thy seed shall be a stranger in a land [that is] not theirs, and shall serve them; and they shall afflict them four hundred years;<br><a name="14">14</a>  And also that nation, whom they shall serve, will I judge: and afterward shall they come out with great substance.<br><a name="15">15</a>  And thou shalt go to thy fathers in peace; thou shalt be buried in a good old age.<br><a name="16">16</a>  But in the fourth generation they shall come hither again: for the iniquity of the Amorites [is] not yet full.<br><a name="17">17</a>. And it came to pass, that, when the sun went down, and it was dark, behold a smoking furnace, and a burning lamp that passed between those pieces.<br><a name="18">18</a>  In the same day the LORD made a covenant with Abram, saying, Unto thy seed have I given this land, from the river of Egypt unto the great river, the river Euphrates:<br><a name="19">19</a>  The Kenites, and the Kenizzites, and the Kadmonites,<br><a name="20">20</a>  And the Hittites, and the Perizzites, and the Rephaims,<br><a name="21">21</a>  And the Amorites, and the Canaanites, and the Girgashites, and the Jebusites.
