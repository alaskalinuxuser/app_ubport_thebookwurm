Genesis  48<br>1. And it came to pass after these things, that [one] told Joseph, Behold, thy father [is] sick: and he took with him his two sons, Manasseh and Ephraim.<br><a name="2">2</a>  And [one] told Jacob, and said, Behold, thy son Joseph cometh unto thee: and Israel strengthened himself, and sat upon the bed.<br><a name="3">3</a>  And Jacob said unto Joseph, God Almighty appeared unto me at Luz in the land of Canaan, and blessed me,<br><a name="4">4</a>  And said unto me, Behold, I will make thee fruitful, and multiply thee, and I will make of thee a multitude of people; and will give this land to thy seed after thee [for] an everlasting possession.<br><a name="5">5</a>  And now thy two sons, Ephraim and Manasseh, which were born unto thee in the land of Egypt before I came unto thee into Egypt, [are] mine; as Reuben and Simeon, they shall be mine.<br><a name="6">6</a>  And thy issue, which thou begettest after them, shall be thine, [and] shall be called after the name of their brethren in their inheritance.<br><a name="7">7</a>  And as for me, when I came from Padan, Rachel died by me in the land of Canaan in the way, when yet [there was] but a little way to come unto Ephrath: and I buried her there in the way of Ephrath; the same [is] Bethlehem.<br><a name="8">8</a>. And Israel beheld Joseph's sons, and said, Who [are] these?<br><a name="9">9</a>  And Joseph said unto his father, They [are] my sons, whom God hath given me in this [place]. And he said, Bring them, I pray thee, unto me, and I will bless them.<br><a name="10">10</a>  Now the eyes of Israel were dim for age, [so that] he could not see. And he brought them near unto him; and he kissed them, and embraced them.<br><a name="11">11</a>  And Israel said unto Joseph, I had not thought to see thy face: and, lo, God hath shewed me also thy seed.<br><a name="12">12</a>  And Joseph brought them out from between his knees, and he bowed himself with his face to the earth.<br><a name="13">13</a>  And Joseph took them both, Ephraim in his right hand toward Israel's left hand, and Manasseh in his left hand toward Israel's right hand, and brought [them] near unto him.<br><a name="14">14</a>  And Israel stretched out his right hand, and laid [it] upon Ephraim's head, who [was] the younger, and his left hand upon Manasseh's head, guiding his hands wittingly; for Manasseh [was] the firstborn.<br><a name="15">15</a>  And he blessed Joseph, and said, God, before whom my fathers Abraham and Isaac did walk, the God which fed me all my life long unto this day,<br><a name="16">16</a>  The Angel which redeemed me from all evil, bless the lads; and let my name be named on them, and the name of my fathers Abraham and Isaac; and let them grow into a multitude in the midst of the earth.<br><a name="17">17</a>  And when Joseph saw that his father laid his right hand upon the head of Ephraim, it displeased him: and he held up his father's hand, to remove it from Ephraim's head unto Manasseh's head.<br><a name="18">18</a>  And Joseph said unto his father, Not so, my father: for this [is] the firstborn; put thy right hand upon his head.<br><a name="19">19</a>  And his father refused, and said, I know [it], my son, I know [it]: he also shall become a people, and he also shall be great: but truly his younger brother shall be greater than he, and his seed shall become a multitude of nations.<br><a name="20">20</a>  And he blessed them that day, saying, In thee shall Israel bless, saying, God make thee as Ephraim and as Manasseh: and he set Ephraim before Manasseh.<br><a name="21">21</a>  And Israel said unto Joseph, Behold, I die: but God shall be with you, and bring you again unto the land of your fathers.<br><a name="22">22</a>  Moreover I have given to thee one portion above thy brethren, which I took out of the hand of the Amorite with my sword and with my bow.<br><br>Go to <a href="gen49.htm#1">Genesis 49</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
