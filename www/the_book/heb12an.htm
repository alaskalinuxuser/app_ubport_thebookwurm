<dl><dt><a name="4"></a>
<b><i>12:4 Ye have not yet resisted unto blood, striving against sin.</i></b></dt><dl>
<dt>resisted- GK=antikathistemi, to be set against.
<dt>striving- GK-antagonizomai, to agonize against.
<dt>unto blood- cp. the examples of the witnesses (GK=martyrs) of <a href="heb12.htm#1" target="lwr_lt">v.1</a> (eg., <a href="heb11.htm#35">11:35-38</a>), <dd>and of our Lord Jesus (<a href="heb12.htm#2" target="lwr_lt">v.2</a>).
<dd><a href="mat24.htm#9">Mat 24:9</a>; <a href="2tim4.htm#6">2Tim 4:6,7</a>; <a href="rev6.htm#9">Rev 6:9-11</a>
<dt>By &quot;looking unto Jesus&quot; (<a href="heb12.htm#2" target="lwr_lt">v.2</a>), those who live by faith will endure through:
<dd>A. Opposition (&quot;contradiction of sinners&quot; v.3) (<a href="heb12.htm#1" target="lwr_lt">vs.1-4</a>).
<dd>B. Chastening (from the Father) (<a href="heb12.htm#5" target="lwr_lt">vs. 5-17</a>).
<dd>C. Shaking (of the world system by God) (<a href="heb12.htm#18" target="lwr_lt">vs. 18-29</a>).</dl>
<dt><b><i>12:5 And ye have forgotten the exhortation which speaketh unto you as unto children,<br>
My son, despise not thou the chastening of the Lord,<br>
nor faint when thou art rebuked of him:</i></b>{quotes <a href="pro3.htm#11">Prov 3:11,12</a>}
<dd>despise not- ie., do not regard as of little import
<dd>faint not- Prov 3:11b is lit., &quot;loathe not his correction.&quot;
<dt><b><i>12:6 For whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth,<br>
and scourgeth every son whom he receiveth.</i></b></dt><dl>
<dt>love- is the basis of God's chastening of His children.
<dt>son- GK=huios, mature son.
<dd>God chastens every son (not just His little children).
<dd>You &amp; I can never consider ourselves beyond the need for His correction.
<dd><a href="1cor11.htm#32">1Cor 11:32</a>; <a href="rev3.htm#19">Rev 3:19</a>
<dt>every son whom he receiveth- ie., 'receives with approval' (cp. &quot;in whom he delights,&quot; <a href="pro3.htm#12">Prov 3:12</a>).</dl>
<dt><b><i>12:7 If </i></b>{since} <b><i>ye endure chastening, God dealeth with you as with sons;<br>
for what son is he whom the father chasteneth not?</i></b></dt><dl>
<dt>chastening- GK=paideuo, child training, discipline, correction (not just punishment).
<dd>Chastening demonstrates our sonship. cp. <a href="pro13.htm#24">Prov 13:24</a>; <a href="pro19.htm#18">19:18</a>; <a href="pro22.htm#15">22:15</a>; <a href="pro23.htm#13">23:13,14</a>
<dt>Seven reasons God's people suffer [JVMcGee]-
<dd>1. For our own stupidity - <a href="1pet2.htm#20">1Pet 2:20</a>
<dd>2. For taking a stand for truth &amp; righteousness - <a href="1pet3.htm#14">1Pet 3:14</a>
<dd>3. For sin in our lives - <a href="1cor11.htm#31">1Cor 11:31</a>
<dd>4. For past sin - <a href="gal6.htm#7">Gal 6:7</a>
<dd>5. For an unseen purpose of God - eg., Job
<dd>6. For their faith - <a href="heb11.htm#35">Heb 11:35-38</a>
<dd>7. For discipline - <a href="heb12.htm#5" target="lwr_lt">Heb 12:5-17</a></dl>
<dt><b><i>12:8 But if ye be without chastisement, whereof all are partakers,<br>
then are ye bastards, and not sons.</i></b></dt><dl>
<dt>chastisement- This word is the noun form of 'chastening' (cp. <a href="heb12.htm#7" target="lwr_lt">v.7</a>).
<dt>bastards- GK=nothos, illegitimate children, of no certain paternity:
<dd>Those whom God does not acknowledged as His children.<ul>
<li>All true children of God are disciplined by Him.
<dd>But He disciplines only His own. (cp. <a href="rev3.htm#19">Rev 3:19</a>)<dt>
<li>God has no illegitimate children. Of many who claim &quot;God is my Father,&quot;
<dd>He says, &quot;I never knew you.&quot; <a href="joh8.htm#38">Joh 8:38-45</a>; <a href="mat7.htm#21">Mat 7:21-23</a></ul></dl>
<dt><b><i>12:9 Furthermore we have had fathers of our flesh which corrected [us],<br>and we gave [them] reverence:</i></b> {<a href="eph6.htm#1">Eph 6:1-3</a>}<br>
<b><i>shall we not much rather be in subjection unto the Father of spirits, and live?</i></b></dt><dl>
<dt>the Father of spirits- Spiritual life comes from God. We live only in union with Him.
<dd><a href="zech12.htm#1">Zech 12:1</a>; <a href="mal1.htm#6">Mal 1:6</a>; <a href="rom8.htm#13">Rom 8:13-16</a>; <a href="jam4.htm#7">Jam 4:7-10</a>; <a href="1pet4.htm#6">1Pet 4:6</a>
<dt>Chastening accomplishes God's purpose within us:</dl>
<dt><b><i>12:10 For they </i></b>{ie., earthly fathers} <b><i>verily for a few days chastened [us] after their own pleasure;<br>
but he for [our] profit, that [we] might be partakers of his holiness.</i></b></dt><dl>
<dt>they... after their own pleasure- ie., as it seemed good to them, or
<dd>to minimize discomfort to themselves caused by our offensive behavior.
<dt>He... for our profit- to make us holy: in the likeness of Christ, fit for His presence.</dl>
<dt><b><i>12:11 Now no chastening for the present seemeth to be joyous, but grievous:<br>
nevertheless afterward it yieldeth the peaceable fruit of righteousness<br>
unto them which are exercised thereby.</i></b></dt><dl>
<dt>fruit- the outcome, the product of chastening is-
<dt>-- peaceable- in contrast to the troubling (chastening) that produces it. <a href="isa32.htm#17">Isa 32:17</a>
<dt>-- righteousness- <dd>This does not mean that chastening somehow turns a sinner into a child of God. But rather that chastening matures God's sons into what He wants them to be. cp. <a href="php1.htm#9">Php 1:9-11</a>; <a href="rom5.htm#3">Rom 5:3-5</a>; <a href="2cor4.htm#17">2Cor 4:17</a>; <a href="heb13.htm#21">Heb 13:21</a>
<dt>them who are 'exercised'- GK=gumnazo. The gymnasium benefits only those who use it.
<dd> How do I react to God's discipline?<ul>
<li>despise not (<a href="heb12.htm#5" target="lwr_lt">v.5</a>)- Do I discount it as not from God? (eg., &quot;Oh, everyone has troubles...&quot;)
<li>faint not (<a href="heb12.htm#5" target="lwr_lt">v.5</a>)- Do I give up, rather than drawing strength from Him?<br>
(eg., &quot;Why did God let this happen to me? What good is it to live for Christ?&quot;)
<li>endure (<a href="heb12.htm#7" target="lwr_lt">v.7</a>)- Do I endure trouble passively, or actively?<br>
(eg., &quot;Lord, let this pass soon.&quot; or &quot;Lord, what do you want to teach me in this?&quot;)
<li>excercised (<a href="heb12.htm#11" target="lwr_lt">v.11</a>)- Do I patiently learn &amp; apply the lessons He would teach me?<br> <a href="1cor9.htm#27">1Cor 9:27</a></ul>
<dt><i>Two aspects of Chastening</i>:
<dd>( 1-) Individual accountability to the Father (<a href="heb12.htm#5" target="lwr_lt">vs.5-11</a>).
<dd>( 2-) Corporate accountability to the Father (<a href="heb12.htm#12" target="lwr_lt">vs.12-17</a>; cp. <a href="heb10.htm#24">10:24</a>).</dl><dt>
<b><i>12:12 Wherefore lift up the hands which hang down, and the feeble knees;</i></b>
<dd>v.12 alludes to <a href="isa35.htm#3">Isa 35:3,4</a>, where tender care is ministered toward<i> others.</i>
<dt><b><i>12:13 And make straight paths for your feet,<br>
lest that which is lame be turned out of the way; but let it rather be healed.</i></b>
<dd><a href="gal6.htm#1">Gal 6:1</a>; <a href="rom14.htm#1">Rom 14:1,2</a>; <a href="1cor8.htm#9">1Cor 8:9</a>
<dt><b><i>12:14 Follow peace with all [men],<br>
and holiness, without which no man shall see the Lord:</i></b></dt><dl>
<dt>follow- ie., pursue:
<dt>-- peace with all men- not just with other believers,
<dd>but to the extent possible, even with your persecutors. <a href="rom12.htm#17">Rom 12:17-21</a>; <a href="1pet3.htm#8">1Pet 3:8-14</a>
<dt>-- holiness- lit., &quot;the sanctification&quot;- which Christ has provided for us,
<dd>and which is required for access into God's presence.
<dd><a href="heb2.htm#11">Heb 2:11</a>; <a href="heb13.htm#12">13:12</a>; <a href="mat5.htm#8">Mat 5:8</a>; <a href="1joh3.htm#2">1Joh 3:2,3</a></dl>
<dt><b><i>12:15 Looking diligently lest any man fail of the grace of God;<br>
lest any root of bitterness springing up trouble [you], and thereby many be defiled;</i></b></dt><dl>
<dt>looking diligently- GK=episkopeo, taking the oversight (as overseers of God's people).
<dd>Note the different word used in <a href="heb12.htm#2" target="lwr_lt">v.2</a> (re: looking unto Jesus alone).
<dd>- - I must first draw near to Him, before I can consider helping a brother (cp. <a href="heb10.htm#22">10:22-24</a>).
<dd>- - I cannot oversee the flock, if I have lost sight of the Chief Shepherd.
<dd>Chastening should make us increasingly dependent upon the Lord.
<dt>As overseers, we are advised to be watchful to correct the following problems:</dt><dl>
<dt>1. Lest any man fail {GK=come behind, miss, fall short} of the grace of God. That is:
<dd>-one who knows the Way of salvation, but fails to enter due to unbelief. <a href="heb4.htm#1">Heb 4:1</a>; <a href="heb10.htm#26">10:26</a>
<dd>-a believer, who in time of need, fails to obtain grace to help. <a href="heb4.htm#16">Heb 4:16</a>
<dt>2. Lest any root of bitterness... spring up... and defile many. Compare: <a href="deu29.htm#18">Deut 29:18</a>; <a href="ecc9.htm#18">Eccl 9:18</a>
<dd>root of bitterness= root of wormwood (a poisonous plant).
<dd>A man, who fails of God's grace, may turn away from God in bitterness.
<dd>One poisonous root of apostasy may be harmful to a whole community of believers.
<dt>3. Lest there be any fornicator, or profane person... (<a href="heb12.htm#16" target="lwr_lt">v.16,17</a>)</dl></dl>
<dt><b><i>12:16 Lest there [be] any fornicator, or profane person,<br>
as Esau, who for one morsel of meat sold his birthright.</i></b></dt><dl>
<dt>fornicator- GK=pornos, one who engages in sexual sins.
<dt>profane- common, unholy (The English word derives from Latin 'profanum': 'against the temple.')
<dd> While the believer is called to moral purity &amp; piety, vs.16-17 are not speaking primarily about sexual sin or about profanity of language.
<dd>At issue, in Esau's case, was a worldly mind which set a higher value on the temporal than the spiritual. Esau committed spiritual adultery by valuing present personal gratification higher than the future spiritual promises of God.
<dt>his birthright- included the priestly privilege &amp; responsibility of the firstborn, and
<dd>would have made him heir to God's promises to Abraham &amp; his descendants. (cp. <a href="heb11.htm#8">11:8-10</a>)
<dd>But Esau regarded it as something common (profane), of less worth than a bowl of pottage. <a href="gen25.htm#29">Gen 25:29-34</a>; <a href="1cor6.htm#13">1Cor 6:13-20</a>
<dt>So, we must beware lest we squander what God's grace has given us.
<dd>Should the Bride of Christ set her affections on earthly things? <a href="col3.htm#1">Col 3:1-4</a></dl>
<dt><b><i>12:17 For ye know how that afterward, when he would have inherited the blessing,<br>
he was rejected: for he found no place of repentance, though he sought it carefully with tears.</i></b></dt><dl>
<dt>he was rejected- ie., disallowed, disapproved.
<dd>Because Esau despised his birthright, he was no longer eligible for the inheritance.
<dt>he found no place for repentance, though he sought it {the blessing} with tears-
<dd>We might ask whether his tears represented godly sorrow for sin, or worldly sorrow for loss.
<dd>However, the issue here is not that Esau could not repent,
<dd>but that once he had given up his right to blessing, his repentance availed nothing.
<dd>His tears could not buy back what he had previously sold.
