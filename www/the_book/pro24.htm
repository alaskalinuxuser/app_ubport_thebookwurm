Proverbs  24<br>1. Be not thou envious against evil men, neither desire to be with them.<br><a name="2">2</a>  For their heart studieth destruction, and their lips talk of mischief.<br><a name="3">3</a>. Through wisdom is an house builded; and by understanding it is established:<br><a name="4">4</a>  And by knowledge shall the chambers be filled with all precious and pleasant riches.<br><a name="5">5</a>  A wise man [is] strong; yea, a man of knowledge increaseth strength.<br><a name="6">6</a>  For by wise counsel thou shalt make thy war: and in multitude of counsellors [there is] safety.<br><a name="7">7</a>. Wisdom [is] too high for a fool: he openeth not his mouth in the gate.<br><a name="8">8</a>  He that deviseth to do evil shall be called a mischievous person.<br><a name="9">9</a>  The thought of foolishness [is] sin: and the scorner [is] an abomination to men.<br><a name="10">10</a>. [If] thou faint in the day of adversity, thy strength [is] small.<br><a name="11">11</a>. If thou forbear to deliver [them that are] drawn unto death, and [those that are] ready to be slain;<br><a name="12">12</a>  If thou sayest, Behold, we knew it not; doth not he that pondereth the heart consider [it]? and he that keepeth thy soul, doth [not] he know [it]? and shall [not] he render to [every] man according to his works?<br><a name="13">13</a>. My son, eat thou honey, because [it is] good; and the honeycomb, [which is] sweet to thy taste:<br><a name="14">14</a>  So [shall] the knowledge of wisdom [be] unto thy soul: when thou hast found [it], then there shall be a reward, and thy expectation shall not be cut off.<br><a name="15">15</a>. Lay not wait, O wicked [man], against the dwelling of the righteous; spoil not his resting place:<br><a name="16">16</a>  For a just [man] falleth seven times, and riseth up again: but the wicked shall fall into mischief.<br><a name="17">17</a>. Rejoice not when thine enemy falleth, and let not thine heart be glad when he stumbleth:<br><a name="18">18</a>  Lest the LORD see [it], and it displease him, and he turn away his wrath from him.<br><a name="19">19</a>. Fret not thyself because of evil [men], neither be thou envious at the wicked;<br><a name="20">20</a>  For there shall be no reward to the evil [man]; the candle of the wicked shall be put out.<br><a name="21">21</a>. My son, fear thou the LORD and the king: [and] meddle not with them that are given to change:<br><a name="22">22</a>  For their calamity shall rise suddenly; and who knoweth the ruin of them both?<br><a name="23">23</a>. These [things] also [belong] to the wise. [It is] not good to have respect of persons in judgment.<br><a name="24">24</a>  He that saith unto the wicked, Thou [art] righteous; him shall the people curse, nations shall abhor him:<br><a name="25">25</a>  But to them that rebuke [him] shall be delight, and a good blessing shall come upon them.<br><a name="26">26</a>  [Every man] shall kiss [his] lips that giveth a right answer.<br><a name="27">27</a>. Prepare thy work without, and make it fit for thyself in the field; and afterwards build thine house.<br><a name="28">28</a>. Be not a witness against thy neighbour without cause; and deceive [not] with thy lips.<br><a name="29">29</a>  Say not, I will do so to him as he hath done to me: I will render to the man according to his work.<br><a name="30">30</a>. I went by the field of the slothful, and by the vineyard of the man void of understanding;<br><a name="31">31</a>  And, lo, it was all grown over with thorns, [and] nettles had covered the face thereof, and the stone wall thereof was broken down.<br><a name="32">32</a>  Then I saw, [and] considered [it] well: I looked upon [it, and] received instruction.<br><a name="33">33</a>  [Yet] a little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to sleep:<br><a name="34">34</a>  So shall thy poverty come [as] one that travelleth; and thy want as an armed man.<br><br>Go to <a href="pro25.htm#1">Proverbs 25</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
