LORD, how are they increased that trouble me! many [are] they that rise up against me.<br><a name="2">2</a>  Many [there be] which say of my soul, [There is] no help for him in God. Selah.<br><a name="3">3</a>  But thou, O LORD, [art] a shield for me; my glory, and the lifter up of mine head.<br><a name="4">4</a>. I cried unto the LORD with my voice, and he heard me out of his holy hill. Selah.<br><a name="5">5</a>  I laid me down and slept; I awaked; for the LORD sustained me.<br><a name="6">6</a>  I will not be afraid of ten thousands of people, that have set [themselves] against me round about.<br><a name="7">7</a>  Arise, O LORD; save me, O my God: for thou hast smitten all mine enemies [upon] the cheek bone; thou hast broken the teeth of the ungodly.<br><a name="8">8</a>  Salvation [belongeth] unto the LORD: thy blessing [is] upon thy people.
