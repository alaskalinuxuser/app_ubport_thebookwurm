Deuteronomy  34<br>1. And Moses went up from the plains of Moab unto the mountain of Nebo, to the top of Pisgah, that [is] over against Jericho. And the LORD shewed him all the land of Gilead, unto Dan,<br><a name="2">2</a>  And all Naphtali, and the land of Ephraim, and Manasseh, and all the land of Judah, unto the utmost sea,<br><a name="3">3</a>  And the south, and the plain of the valley of Jericho, the city of palm trees, unto Zoar.<br><a name="4">4</a>  And the LORD said unto him, This [is] the land which I sware unto Abraham, unto Isaac, and unto Jacob, saying, I will give it unto thy seed: I have caused thee to see [it] with thine eyes, but thou shalt not go over thither.<br><a name="5">5</a>. So Moses the servant of the LORD died there in the land of Moab, according to the word of the LORD.<br><a name="6">6</a>  And he buried him in a valley in the land of Moab, over against Bethpeor: but no man knoweth of his sepulchre unto this day.<br><a name="7">7</a>  And Moses [was] an hundred and twenty years old when he died: his eye was not dim, nor his natural force abated.<br><a name="8">8</a>  And the children of Israel wept for Moses in the plains of Moab thirty days: so the days of weeping [and] mourning for Moses were ended.<br><a name="9">9</a>. And Joshua the son of Nun was full of the spirit of wisdom; for Moses had laid his hands upon him: and the children of Israel hearkened unto him, and did as the LORD commanded Moses.<br><a name="10">10</a>  And there arose not a prophet since in Israel like unto Moses, whom the LORD knew face to face,<br><a name="11">11</a>  In all the signs and the wonders, which the LORD sent him to do in the land of Egypt to Pharaoh, and to all his servants, and to all his land,<br><a name="12">12</a>  And in all that mighty hand, and in all the great terror which Moses shewed in the sight of all Israel.<br><br>End of Deuteronomy.<br>Go to <a href="josh1.htm#1">Joshua 1</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
