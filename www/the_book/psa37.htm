Psalms  37<br> 1. [A Psalm] of David. Fret not thyself because of evildoers, neither be thou envious against the workers of iniquity.<br><a name="2">2</a>  For they shall soon be cut down like the grass, and wither as the green herb.<br><a name="3">3</a>  Trust in the LORD, and do good; [so] shalt thou dwell in the land, and verily thou shalt be fed.<br><a name="4">4</a>  Delight thyself also in the LORD; and he shall give thee the desires of thine heart.<br><a name="5">5</a>  Commit thy way unto the LORD; trust also in him; and he shall bring [it] to pass.<br><a name="6">6</a>  And he shall bring forth thy righteousness as the light, and thy judgment as the noonday.<br><a name="7">7</a>. Rest in the LORD, and wait patiently for him: fret not thyself because of him who prospereth in his way, because of the man who bringeth wicked devices to pass.<br><a name="8">8</a>  Cease from anger, and forsake wrath: fret not thyself in any wise to do evil.<br><a name="9">9</a>  For evildoers shall be cut off: but those that wait upon the LORD, they shall inherit the earth.<br><a name="10">10</a>  For yet a little while, and the wicked [shall] not [be]: yea, thou shalt diligently consider his place, and it [shall] not [be].<br><a name="11">11</a>  But the meek shall inherit the earth; and shall delight themselves in the abundance of peace.<br><a name="12">12</a>  The wicked plotteth against the just, and gnasheth upon him with his teeth.<br><a name="13">13</a>  The Lord shall laugh at him: for he seeth that his day is coming.<br><a name="14">14</a>  The wicked have drawn out the sword, and have bent their bow, to cast down the poor and needy, [and] to slay such as be of upright conversation.<br><a name="15">15</a>  Their sword shall enter into their own heart, and their bows shall be broken.<br><a name="16">16</a>  A little that a righteous man hath [is] better than the riches of many wicked.<br><a name="17">17</a>  For the arms of the wicked shall be broken: but the LORD upholdeth the righteous.<br><a name="18">18</a>  The LORD knoweth the days of the upright: and their inheritance shall be for ever.<br><a name="19">19</a>  They shall not be ashamed in the evil time: and in the days of famine they shall be satisfied.<br><a name="20">20</a>  But the wicked shall perish, and the enemies of the LORD [shall be] as the fat of lambs: they shall consume; into smoke shall they consume away.<br><a name="21">21</a>. The wicked borroweth, and payeth not again: but the righteous sheweth mercy, and giveth.<br><a name="22">22</a>  For [such as be] blessed of him shall inherit the earth; and [they that be] cursed of him shall be cut off.<br><a name="23">23</a>  The steps of a [good] man are ordered by the LORD: and he delighteth in his way.<br><a name="24">24</a>  Though he fall, he shall not be utterly cast down: for the LORD upholdeth [him with] his hand.<br><a name="25">25</a>  I have been young, and [now] am old; yet have I not seen the righteous forsaken, nor his seed begging bread.<br><a name="26">26</a>  [He is] ever merciful, and lendeth; and his seed [is] blessed.<br><a name="27">27</a>  Depart from evil, and do good; and dwell for evermore.<br><a name="28">28</a>  For the LORD loveth judgment, and forsaketh not his saints; they are preserved for ever: but the seed of the wicked shall be cut off.<br><a name="29">29</a>  The righteous shall inherit the land, and dwell therein for ever.<br><a name="30">30</a>  The mouth of the righteous speaketh wisdom, and his tongue talketh of judgment.<br><a name="31">31</a>  The law of his God [is] in his heart; none of his steps shall slide.<br><a name="32">32</a>  The wicked watcheth the righteous, and seeketh to slay him.<br><a name="33">33</a>  The LORD will not leave him in his hand, nor condemn him when he is judged.<br><a name="34">34</a>. Wait on the LORD, and keep his way, and he shall exalt thee to inherit the land: when the wicked are cut off, thou shalt see [it].<br><a name="35">35</a>  I have seen the wicked in great power, and spreading himself like a green bay tree.<br><a name="36">36</a>  Yet he passed away, and, lo, he [was] not: yea, I sought him, but he could not be found.<br><a name="37">37</a>  Mark the perfect [man], and behold the upright: for the end of [that] man [is] peace.<br><a name="38">38</a>  But the transgressors shall be destroyed together: the end of the wicked shall be cut off.<br><a name="39">39</a>  But the salvation of the righteous [is] of the LORD: [he is] their strength in the time of trouble.<br><a name="40">40</a>  And the LORD shall help them, and deliver them: he shall deliver them from the wicked, and save them, because they trust in him.<br><br>Go to <a href="psa38.htm#1">Psalm 38</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
