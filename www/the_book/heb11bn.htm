<dl><dt>
Examples of men who walked by faith (continued):</dt><dl>
<dt><b>E. </b>The remainder of the chapter shows us: <i>The Warfare of Faith -</i>
<dt>The enemies of faith include:
<dd>a. The flesh (<a href="heb11.htm#17" target="lwr_lt">vs.17-21</a>), cp. <a href="1pet2.htm#11">1Pet 2:11</a>
<dd>b. The world system (<a href="heb11.htm#22" target="lwr_lt">vs.22-28</a>)
<dd>c. The Devil's dominion (<a href="heb11.htm#29" target="lwr_lt">vs.29-31</a>)</dl><dt>
<b><i>11:17 By faith Abraham, when he was tried, offered up Isaac:<br>
and he that had received the promises offered up his only begotten [son],</i></b></dt><dl>
<dt>Abraham did not receive the fulfillment of God's promises in his lifetime (<a href="heb11.htm#13" target="lwr_lt">v.13</a>).
<dd>But in his old age, he did receive the promised and long awaited son (Isaac) through whom the fulfillment would eventually come (in the person of our Lord Jesus Christ, at His first &amp; second comings).
<dd>To Abraham, this son became the focus &amp; joy of his life. (&quot;Isaac&quot; means &quot;laughter.&quot;)
<dd>Had Abraham's heart, which once yearned for God alone, been stolen by this son?
<dt>God tried (tested) Abraham: Would he trust &amp; obey, even
<dd>when God's Word was contrary to his natural (fleshly) affections &amp; expectations?
<dt>his only begotten- GK=monogenes, unique, one of a kind, irreplaceable.
<dd>By means of a fleshly plan, Abraham had another son (eg., Ishmael). 
<dd>But Ishmael was not the son of promise. <a href="gen17.htm#18">Gen 17:18,19</a>
<dd>The promises (for which Abraham lived and yearned) were all hung upon Isaac. (<a href="heb11.htm#18" target="lwr_lt">v.18</a>)</dl>
<dt><b><i>11:18 Of whom it was said, That in Isaac shall thy seed be called:</i></b> {<a href="gen21.htm#12">Gen 21:12</a>}
<dt><b><i>11:19 Accounting that God [was] able to raise [him] up,<br>
even from the dead; from whence also he received him in a figure.</i></b> {<a href="gen22.htm#1">Gen 22:1-19</a>}</dt><dl>
<dt>Abraham believed that the God who commanded him to offer Isaac as a burnt sacrifice, would somehow keep His previous promise (v.18) even if it required Isaac's resurrection from the dead.
<dt>Abraham's obedience was so quick &amp; complete, that Isaac was as good as dead.
<dt>Only the Lord's intervention allowed Abraham and Isaac to &quot;worship and come again...&quot; (cp. <a href="rom4.htm#17">Rom 4:17-21</a>)</dl>
<dt><b><i>11:20 By faith Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau concerning things to come.</i></b></dt><dl>
<dt>Isaac's natural (fleshly) preference was to favor Esau over Jacob.
<dd>Esau was a ruddy man's man, a rugged outdoorsman.
<dd>Jacob was a momma's boy, who had a reputation as a deceiver.
<dt>Jacob and his mother conspired to deceive Isaac and steal Esau's blessing.
<dd>In spite of their fleshly plan, and his own fleshly preference, Isaac soon recognised that God's choice was contrary to his own, and surrendered to it.
 <a href="gen27.htm#26">Gen 27:26-<b>33</b>-40</a> 
<dt>He blessed -- Jacob before Esau (though Esau was the firstborn).
<dd>-- regarding things yet future, yet to be seen. (cp. <a href="heb11.htm#1" target="lwr_lt">vs.1,3</a>)</dl>
<dt><b><i>11:21 By faith Jacob, when he was a dying, blessed both the sons of Joseph;<br>
and worshipped, [leaning] upon the top of his staff.</i></b></dt><dl>
<dt>Jacob blessed Joseph's sons...<ul>
<li>contrary to the natural (fleshly) order:
<dd>Ephraim before Manasseh (the first-born), over Joseph's protests to the contrary. <a href="gen48.htm#13">Gen 48:13-20</a></dd>
<li>with worship and sensitivity to the LORD's leading.
<dd>'Leaning upon... his staff' probably refers to Jacob's bowing himself before the LORD, just prior to giving his blessings (<a href="gen48.htm#12">Gen 48:12</a>).</ul>
<dt>Jacob's request regarding his burial may also be in view here. <dd>Like the blessing of Joseph's sons, his request demonstrated his faith in God's promise of future inheritance of the land in which he had been a stranger. <a href="gen47.htm#29">Gen 47:29-31</a></dl>
<dt><b><i>11:22 By faith Joseph, when he died </i></b>{lit., drawing to his end},<br><b><i>
made mention of the departing of the children of Israel;<br>
and gave commandment concerning his bones.</i></b></dt><dl>
<dt>made mention- GK=mnenenouo, called to mind, remembered.
<dd>Based on God's Word (<a href="gen15.htm#13">Gen 15:13,14</a>), Joseph anticipated Israel's departure from Egypt (350 years after his time).
<dt>gave commandment concerning his bones-<dd>ie., 'When you depart, take my bones with you.' <a href="gen50.htm#24">Gen 50:24-26</a>
<dt>Why didn't Israel return immediately to the promised land? Because of the world:
<dd>They were in political favor &amp; economic prosperity.
<dt>Why didn't Israel bury Joseph in Canaan as soon as he died? Because of the world:
<dd>He was a national hero, held in highest honor by Egypt. (cp. <a href="gen50.htm#26">Gen 50:26</a>)
<dt>But eventually, a Pharaoh would arise who had no respect for Joseph, <dd>and Israel would be slaves, during most of their sojourn in Egypt.<dd>Long before Israel developed a desire to depart, Joseph believed God's Word despite the contra-indication of contemporary political favor. cp. <a href="ex13.htm#19">Ex 13:19</a>; <a href="josh24.htm#32">Josh 24:32</a></dl>
<dt><a name="23"></a>
<b><i>11:23 By faith Moses, when he was born, was hid three months of his parents,<br>
because they saw [he was] a proper child;<br>
and they were not afraid of the king's commandment.</i></b></dt><dl>
<dt>Moses' parents, in a time of political disfavor, <dd>feared God and obeyed Him rather than the king. <a href="ex1.htm#15">Ex 1:15,16,22</a>; <a href="ex2.htm#1">2:1-3</a>
<dt>a proper child- OT word: pleasant, agreeable. NT word: polished, comely, fair.
<dd>Apparently, baby Moses' appearance &amp; demeanor, somehow, confirmed to his parents that God's will was superior to Pharaoh's. They acted in faith, in an environment of intimidation, where fleshly fear would naturally discourage obedience to God.</dl>
<dt><b><i>11:24 By faith Moses, when he was come to years,<br>
refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter;</i></b></dt><dl>
<dt>Moses, in a time of political opportunity,
<dd>refused- He threw away his privileged position, which may have placed him in line for Egypt's throne.
<dd><a href="ex2.htm#10">Ex 2:10</a>; <a href="act7.htm#21">Acts 7:21-24</a></dl>
<dt><b><i>11:25 Choosing</i></b> {ie., having chosen} <b><i>rather to suffer affliction with the people of God,<br>
than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season;</i></b></dt><dl>
<dt>Moses chose to identify with the people of God, though to do so would be costly.
<dd>He forfeited his fleshly advantage, and became a fugitive. <a href="ex2.htm#11">Ex 2:11-15</a>
<dt>To do otherwise, would have been sin. Sin has its pleasures, but they soon pass. <dd>As a member of the royal family, Moses had access to all kinds of pleasures, but he chose not to live for the present. <a href="psa73.htm#1">Psa 73:1-3,15-20</a>; <a href="jam5.htm#1">James 5:1-7</a></dl>
<dt><b><i>11:26 Esteeming the reproach of</i></b> {the} <b><i>Christ greater riches than the treasures in Egypt:<br>
for he had respect unto the recompence of the reward.</i></b></dt><dl>
<dt>the Christ- the Messiah, the anointed One.
<dd>by whom &amp; in whom God's promises would come to fruition.
<dd>Faith has always looked to Him. <a href="psa89.htm#50">Psa 89:50,51</a>
<dd>The world has always reproached Him (held Him in distain). cp. <a href="heb13.htm#13">Heb 13:13</a>
<dd>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moses identified himself with the people of Israel, through whom the promised Seed would come, to bless all nations (<a href="gal3.htm#16">Gal 3:16</a>). How did Moses, who was &quot;learned in all the wisdom of the Egyptians,&quot; come to faith in the promises of Israel's God? Apparently, through the instruction of his mother, during his earliest years, prior to becoming the son of Pharaoh's daughter (<a href="ex2.htm#9">Ex 2:9,10</a>).
<dt>Moses 'had respect'...- GK=apoblepo, to look away from all else to gaze at one object. [WEVine]
<dd>...to the recompense of the reward - or, 'unto the payment of wages.'
<dd>To Moses, the treasures of Egypt were as nothing, compared to the treasure in Heaven. cp. <a href="heb10.htm#35">Heb 10:35-38</a></dl>
<dt><b><i>11:27 By faith he forsook Egypt, not fearing the wrath of the king:<br>
for he endured, as seeing him who is invisible.</i></b></dt><dl>
<dt>Moses forsook- Gk=kataleipo, to leave behind.
<dd>Twice, Moses left Egypt behind for the wilderness.
<dd>The first time, he tended Jethro's sheep. Later, he shepherded God's people.
<dt>Moses endured- GK= kartereo, to be steadfast (related to GK kratos, strength)
<dd>In the contest with Pharaoh &amp; in the trials of the wilderness, things looked hopeless, but he looked to God, the source of his strength. cp. <a href="heb11.htm#1" target="lwr_lt">vs.1,3</a>; <a href="ex33.htm#14">Ex 33:14,15</a>; <a href="psa16.htm#8">Psa 16:8</a><br>For Moses, the 'things seen' included Pharaoh's wrath, stern taskmasters, afflictive burdens, hard bondage, mortar and brick; the things 'not seen' included God's eternal purpose, His unfailing promise, His continual Presence, and the approaching day of salvation. [adapted from CHM]</dl>
<dt><b><i>11:28 Through faith he </i></b>{hath} <b><i>kept the passover, and the sprinkling of blood,<br>
lest he that destroyed the firstborn should touch them.</i></b></dt><dl>
<dt>the passover- salvation through the blood of the lamb (looking forward to Christ).
<dt>lest [the destroyer] touch them- Moses recognised that
<dd>the sentence of death for sin applied to Israel as well as to Egypt.
<dt>through faith- Moses &amp; believing Israel applied the prescribed remedy.
<dd><a href="ex12.htm#12">Ex 12:12,21-23,28,29</a></dl>
<dt><b><i>11:29 By faith they passed through the Red sea as by dry [land]:<br>
which the Egyptians assaying </i></b>{ie., attempting}<i><b> to do were drowned.</i></b></dt><dl>
<dt>Faith in, and obedience to, God's Word set Israel apart from Egypt, though both took the same path:
<dd>For Eqypt it was the way of self-will &amp; self-strength leading to death.
<dd>For Israel it was the way of God's mercy &amp; God's power leading to victory.
<dt>God brought His people out of Egypt (symbolic of slavery under Satan's dominion),
<dd>by the blood of the lamb (<a href="heb11.htm#28" target="lwr_lt">v.28</a>), and by the power of His own arm.
<dd><a href="ex14.htm#13">Ex 14:13-31</a>; <a href="ex15.htm#1">15:1-20</a></dl>
<dt><b><i>11:30 By faith the walls of Jericho fell down,<br>
after they were compassed about seven days.</i></b></dt><dl>
<dt>the walls of Jericho- represented the strongholds of Satan's dominion.
<dt>fell down- not by human might, power, or strategy.
<dd>Joshua obeyed the orders of the Captain of the Lord's host [army].
<dt>compassed about [for] seven days- For six days, and most of the seventh,
<dd>obedience to God's Word must have seemed very foolish to those on Jericho's walls.
<dt>by faith- Israel held on, to what could not be seen, until the moment of the shout.
<dd><a href="josh5.htm#13">Josh 5:13 - 6:5</a>; <a href="2cor10.htm#3">2Cor 10:3-5</a></dl>
<dt><b><i>11:31 By faith the harlot Rahab perished not with them that believed not,<br>
when she had received the spies with peace.</i></b></dt><dl>
<dt>Rahab was a child of Satan's dominion-
<dd>-- she grew up among a godless people (&quot;them that believed not&quot;).
<dd>-- she was personally impure (a harlot).
<dt>by faith- she turned from these to the true and living God.
<dd>Read her testimony: <a href="josh2.htm#9">Josh 2:9-11</a>
<dt>received the spies- Her action, in behalf of the people of the true God,
<dd>and at considerable personal risk, demonstrated her faith.
<dt>perished not- God saved her and did His work in her life.
<dd>Her past sins &amp; associations were forgiven.
<dd>Her name is included in the ancestral line of Jesus. (<a href="mat1.htm#5">Mat 1:5</a>)
<br>&nbsp;
<dt>The specific examples above are sufficient to guide the believer in the life of faith in obedience to God's Word. But countless others have lived by faith. Each person's story is unique in trials &amp; blessings. But all looked, by faith, beyond this earthly life (<a href="heb11.htm#13" target="lwr_lt">vs.13-16</a>).</dl>

<dt><b><i>11:39 And these all, having obtained a good report</i></b> {ie., testimony}<b><i> through faith,<br>

<dt>a cloud of 'witnesses' (GK=martus, lit., testimony bearers)-
<dd> The picture is not of a stadium full of spectators looking down on the players to see whether they stand or fall, but rather, of a crowd of runners, in a great marathon, moving toward a common goal. Some have gone before us. Others follow behind. Those, mentioned in ch.11, did not reach the goal in their lifetimes. Although we have received further revelation, than they, we have not yet passed the finish line, nor received the prize. Even in death, our faithful predecessors speak. Their testimony encourages us to endure. Together, they say:
<dd>&quot;The Word of the Lord stands sure!&quot; and, &quot;He is faithful that promised!&quot;
<dt>let us lay aside-<ul>
<li>every weight- ie., our individual weaknesses.
<dd>These are the things we often call 'our besetting sins,' which hinder our progress, in 'the race that is set before us.' The world will not help us live for God. We dare not impede ourselves. <a href="heb12.htm#12">Heb 12:12,13</a><dt>
<li>the sin which doth 'so easily beset us' [lit., 'so readily stands round us']- 
<dd>While we may differ concerning the type of sins to which we are predisposed, the focus of the passage is on one sin (singular), which is common to us all. What is this common sin which so easily besets us? It is the sin of unbelief. cp. <a href="heb3.htm#12">Heb 3:12-19</a>; <a href="heb4.htm#1">4:1-2</a></ul>

<dt>Oh, Lord, how do you see us?
<dt>Are we running the race well? -living by faith in your sure Word?
<dd>Or are we hobbling along, hamstrung by our own fleshly thinking, <br>by the corrupt culture in which we live, and by the opposition of the evil one?
<dt>Have you not told us -that your promises are for &quot;him that overcomes&quot; these things?
<dd>and -that &quot;he that overcomes&quot; is the one &quot;who believes that Jesus is the Son of God&quot;? (<a href="1joh5.htm#5">1Joh 5:5</a>)
<dt>Oh, Lord, restore us to that well founded faith. For we live in perilous times,
<dd>and there is no other place to stand, no other way to live that pleases you.
