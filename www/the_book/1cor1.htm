1Corinthians   1<br> 1. Paul, called [to be] an apostle of Jesus Christ through the will of God, and Sosthenes [our] brother,<br><a name="2">2</a>  Unto the church of God which is at Corinth, to them that are sanctified in Christ Jesus, called [to be] saints, with all that in every place call upon the name of Jesus Christ our Lord, both theirs and ours:<br><a name="3">3</a>  Grace [be] unto you, and peace, from God our Father, and [from] the Lord Jesus Christ.<br><a name="4">4</a>  I thank my God always on your behalf, for the grace of God which is given you by Jesus Christ;<br><a name="5">5</a>  That in every thing ye are enriched by him, in all utterance, and [in] all knowledge;<br><a name="6">6</a>  Even as the testimony of Christ was confirmed in you:<br><a name="7">7</a>  So that ye come behind in no gift; waiting for the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ:<br><a name="8">8</a>  Who shall also confirm you unto the end, [that ye may be] blameless in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ.<br><a name="9">9</a>  God [is] faithful, by whom ye were called unto the fellowship of his Son Jesus Christ our Lord.<br><a name="10">10</a>. Now I beseech you, brethren, by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that ye all speak the same thing, and [that] there be no divisions among you; but [that] ye be perfectly joined together in the same mind and in the same judgment.<br><a name="11">11</a>  For it hath been declared unto me of you, my brethren, by them [which are of the house] of Chloe, that there are contentions among you.<br><a name="12">12</a>  Now this I say, that every one of you saith, I am of Paul; and I of Apollos; and I of Cephas; and I of Christ.<br><a name="13">13</a>  Is Christ divided? was Paul crucified for you? or were ye baptized in the name of Paul?<br><a name="14">14</a>. I thank God that I baptized none of you, but Crispus and Gaius;<br><a name="15">15</a>  Lest any should say that I had baptized in mine own name.<br><a name="16">16</a>  And I baptized also the household of Stephanas: besides, I know not whether I baptized any other.<br><a name="17">17</a>. For Christ sent me not to baptize, but to preach the gospel: not with wisdom of words, lest the cross of Christ should be made of none effect.<br><a name="18">18</a>  For the preaching of the cross is to them that perish foolishness; but unto us which are saved it is the power of God.<br><a name="19">19</a>  For it is written, I will destroy the wisdom of the wise, and will bring to nothing the understanding of the prudent.<br><a name="20">20</a>  Where [is] the wise? where [is] the scribe? where [is] the disputer of this world? hath not God made foolish the wisdom of this world?<br><a name="21">21</a>  For after that in the wisdom of God the world by wisdom knew not God, it pleased God by the foolishness of preaching to save them that believe.<br><a name="22">22</a>  For the Jews require a sign, and the Greeks seek after wisdom:<br><a name="23">23</a>  But we preach Christ crucified, unto the Jews a stumblingblock, and unto the Greeks foolishness;<br><a name="24">24</a>  But unto them which are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God, and the wisdom of God.<br><a name="25">25</a>  Because the foolishness of God is wiser than men; and the weakness of God is stronger than men.<br><a name="26">26</a>  For ye see your calling, brethren, how that not many wise men after the flesh, not many mighty, not many noble, [are called]:<br><a name="27">27</a>  But God hath chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise; and God hath chosen the weak things of the world to confound the things which are mighty;<br><a name="28">28</a>  And base things of the world, and things which are despised, hath God chosen, [yea], and things which are not, to bring to nought things that are:<br><a name="29">29</a>  That no flesh should glory in his presence.<br><a name="30">30</a>  But of him are ye in Christ Jesus, who of God is made unto us wisdom, and righteousness, and sanctification, and redemption:<br><a name="31">31</a>  That, according as it is written, He that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord.<br><br>Go to <a href="1cor2.htm#1">I Corinthians 2</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
