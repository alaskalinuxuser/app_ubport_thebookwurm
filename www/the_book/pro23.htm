Proverbs  23<br> 1. When thou sittest to eat with a ruler, consider diligently what [is] before thee:<br><a name="2">2</a>  And put a knife to thy throat, if thou [be] a man given to appetite.<br><a name="3">3</a>  Be not desirous of his dainties: for they [are] deceitful meat.<br><a name="4">4</a>. Labour not to be rich: cease from thine own wisdom.<br><a name="5">5</a>  Wilt thou set thine eyes upon that which is not? for [riches] certainly make themselves wings; they fly away as an eagle toward heaven.<br><a name="6">6</a>. Eat thou not the bread of [him that hath] an evil eye, neither desire thou his dainty meats:<br><a name="7">7</a>  For as he thinketh in his heart, so [is] he: Eat and drink, saith he to thee; but his heart [is] not with thee.<br><a name="8">8</a>  The morsel [which] thou hast eaten shalt thou vomit up, and lose thy sweet words.<br><a name="9">9</a>. Speak not in the ears of a fool: for he will despise the wisdom of thy words.<br><a name="10">10</a>. Remove not the old landmark; and enter not into the fields of the fatherless:<br><a name="11">11</a>  For their redeemer [is] mighty; he shall plead their cause with thee.<br><a name="12">12</a>. Apply thine heart unto instruction, and thine ears to the words of knowledge.<br><a name="13">13</a>  Withhold not correction from the child: for [if] thou beatest him with the rod, he shall not die.<br><a name="14">14</a>  Thou shalt beat him with the rod, and shalt deliver his soul from hell.<br><a name="15">15</a>  My son, if thine heart be wise, my heart shall rejoice, even mine.<br><a name="16">16</a>  Yea, my reins shall rejoice, when thy lips speak right things.<br><a name="17">17</a>. Let not thine heart envy sinners: but [be thou] in the fear of the LORD all the day long.<br><a name="18">18</a>  For surely there is an end; and thine expectation shall not be cut off.<br><a name="19">19</a>. Hear thou, my son, and be wise, and guide thine heart in the way.<br><a name="20">20</a>  Be not among winebibbers; among riotous eaters of flesh:<br><a name="21">21</a>  For the drunkard and the glutton shall come to poverty: and drowsiness shall clothe [a man] with rags.<br><a name="22">22</a>  Hearken unto thy father that begat thee, and despise not thy mother when she is old.<br><a name="23">23</a>  Buy the truth, and sell [it] not; [also] wisdom, and instruction, and understanding.<br><a name="24">24</a>  The father of the righteous shall greatly rejoice: and he that begetteth a wise [child] shall have joy of him.<br><a name="25">25</a>  Thy father and thy mother shall be glad, and she that bare thee shall rejoice.<br><a name="26">26</a>  My son, give me thine heart, and let thine eyes observe my ways.<br><a name="27">27</a>  For a whore [is] a deep ditch; and a strange woman [is] a narrow pit.<br><a name="28">28</a>  She also lieth in wait as [for] a prey, and increaseth the transgressors among men.<br><a name="29">29</a>. Who hath woe? who hath sorrow? who hath contentions? who hath babbling? who hath wounds without cause? who hath redness of eyes?<br><a name="30">30</a>  They that tarry long at the wine; they that go to seek mixed wine.<br><a name="31">31</a>  Look not thou upon the wine when it is red, when it giveth his colour in the cup, [when] it moveth itself aright.<br><a name="32">32</a>  At the last it biteth like a serpent, and stingeth like an adder.<br><a name="33">33</a>  Thine eyes shall behold strange women, and thine heart shall utter perverse things.<br><a name="34">34</a>  Yea, thou shalt be as he that lieth down in the midst of the sea, or as he that lieth upon the top of a mast.<br><a name="35">35</a>  They have stricken me, [shalt thou say, and] I was not sick; they have beaten me, [and] I felt [it] not: when shall I awake? I will seek it yet again.<br><br>Go to <a href="pro24.htm#1">Proverbs 24</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
