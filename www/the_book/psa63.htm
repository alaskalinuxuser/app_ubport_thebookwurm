Psalms  63<br> 1. A Psalm of David, when he was in the wilderness of Judah. O God, thou [art] my God; early will I seek thee: my soul thirsteth for thee, my flesh longeth for thee in a dry and thirsty land, where no water is;<br><a name="2">2</a>  To see thy power and thy glory, so [as] I have seen thee in the sanctuary.<br><a name="3">3</a>. Because thy lovingkindness [is] better than life, my lips shall praise thee.<br><a name="4">4</a>  Thus will I bless thee while I live: I will lift up my hands in thy name.<br><a name="5">5</a>  My soul shall be satisfied as [with] marrow and fatness; and my mouth shall praise [thee] with joyful lips:<br><a name="6">6</a>  When I remember thee upon my bed, [and] meditate on thee in the [night] watches.<br><a name="7">7</a>. Because thou hast been my help, therefore in the shadow of thy wings will I rejoice.<br><a name="8">8</a>  My soul followeth hard after thee: thy right hand upholdeth me.<br><a name="9">9</a>  But those [that] seek my soul, to destroy [it], shall go into the lower parts of the earth.<br><a name="10">10</a>  They shall fall by the sword: they shall be a portion for foxes.<br><a name="11">11</a>  But the king shall rejoice in God; every one that sweareth by him shall glory: but the mouth of them that speak lies shall be stopped.<br><br>Go to <a href="psa64.htm#1">Psalm 64</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
