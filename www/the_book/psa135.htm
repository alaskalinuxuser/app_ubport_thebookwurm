Psalms 135<br>1. Praise ye the LORD. Praise ye the name of the LORD; praise [him], O ye servants of the LORD.<br><a name="2">2</a>  Ye that stand in the house of the LORD, in the courts of the house of our God,<br><a name="3">3</a>  Praise the LORD; for the LORD [is] good: sing praises unto his name; for [it is] pleasant.<br><a name="4">4</a>  For the LORD hath chosen Jacob unto himself, [and] Israel for his peculiar treasure.<br><a name="5">5</a>. For I know that the LORD [is] great, and [that] our Lord [is] above all gods.<br><a name="6">6</a>  Whatsoever the LORD pleased, [that] did he in heaven, and in earth, in the seas, and all deep places.<br><a name="7">7</a>  He causeth the vapours to ascend from the ends of the earth; he maketh lightnings for the rain; he bringeth the wind out of his treasuries.<br><a name="8">8</a>  Who smote the firstborn of Egypt, both of man and beast.<br><a name="9">9</a>  [Who] sent tokens and wonders into the midst of thee, O Egypt, upon Pharaoh, and upon all his servants.<br><a name="10">10</a>  Who smote great nations, and slew mighty kings;<br><a name="11">11</a>  Sihon king of the Amorites, and Og king of Bashan, and all the kingdoms of Canaan:<br><a name="12">12</a>  And gave their land [for] an heritage, an heritage unto Israel his people.<br><a name="13">13</a>  Thy name, O LORD, [endureth] for ever; [and] thy memorial, O LORD, throughout all generations.<br><a name="14">14</a>  For the LORD will judge his people, and he will repent himself concerning his servants.<br><a name="15">15</a>. The idols of the heathen [are] silver and gold, the work of men's hands.<br><a name="16">16</a>  They have mouths, but they speak not; eyes have they, but they see not;<br><a name="17">17</a>  They have ears, but they hear not; neither is there [any] breath in their mouths.<br><a name="18">18</a>  They that make them are like unto them: [so is] every one that trusteth in them.<br><a name="19">19</a>  Bless the LORD, O house of Israel: bless the LORD, O house of Aaron:<br><a name="20">20</a>  Bless the LORD, O house of Levi: ye that fear the LORD, bless the LORD.<br><a name="21">21</a>  Blessed be the LORD out of Zion, which dwelleth at Jerusalem.
