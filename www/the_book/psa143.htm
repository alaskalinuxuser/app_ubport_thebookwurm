Psalms 143<br>1. A Psalm of David. Hear my prayer, O LORD, give ear to my supplications: in thy faithfulness answer me, [and] in thy righteousness.<br><a name="2">2</a>  And enter not into judgment with thy servant: for in thy sight shall no man living be justified.<br><a name="3">3</a>  For the enemy hath persecuted my soul; he hath smitten my life down to the ground; he hath made me to dwell in darkness, as those that have been long dead.<br><a name="4">4</a>  Therefore is my spirit overwhelmed within me; my heart within me is desolate.<br><a name="5">5</a>  I remember the days of old; I meditate on all thy works; I muse on the work of thy hands.<br><a name="6">6</a>  I stretch forth my hands unto thee: my soul [thirsteth] after thee, as a thirsty land. Selah.<br><a name="7">7</a>. Hear me speedily, O LORD: my spirit faileth: hide not thy face from me, lest I be like unto them that go down into the pit.<br><a name="8">8</a>  Cause me to hear thy lovingkindness in the morning; for in thee do I trust: cause me to know the way wherein I should walk; for I lift up my soul unto thee.<br><a name="9">9</a>  Deliver me, O LORD, from mine enemies: I flee unto thee to hide me.<br><a name="10">10</a>  Teach me to do thy will; for thou [art] my God: thy spirit [is] good; lead me into the land of uprightness.<br><a name="11">11</a>  Quicken me, O LORD, for thy name's sake: for thy righteousness' sake bring my soul out of trouble.<br><a name="12">12</a>  And of thy mercy cut off mine enemies, and destroy all them that afflict my soul: for I [am] thy servant.<br><br>Go to <a href="psa144.htm#1">Psalm 144</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
