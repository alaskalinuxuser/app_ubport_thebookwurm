Job  41<br>1. Canst thou draw out leviathan with an hook? or his tongue with a cord [which] thou lettest down?<br><a name="2">2</a>  Canst thou put an hook into his nose? or bore his jaw through with a thorn?<br><a name="3">3</a>  Will he make many supplications unto thee? will he speak soft [words] unto thee?<br><a name="4">4</a>  Will he make a covenant with thee? wilt thou take him for a servant for ever?<br><a name="5">5</a>  Wilt thou play with him as [with] a bird? or wilt thou bind him for thy maidens?<br><a name="6">6</a>  Shall the companions make a banquet of him? shall they part him among the merchants?<br><a name="7">7</a>  Canst thou fill his skin with barbed irons? or his head with fish spears?<br><a name="8">8</a>  Lay thine hand upon him, remember the battle, do no more.<br><a name="9">9</a>  Behold, the hope of him is in vain: shall not [one] be cast down even at the sight of him?<br><a name="10">10</a>  None [is so] fierce that dare stir him up: who then is able to stand before me?<br><a name="11">11</a>. Who hath prevented me, that I should repay [him? whatsoever is] under the whole heaven is mine.<br><a name="12">12</a>  I will not conceal his parts, nor his power, nor his comely proportion.<br><a name="13">13</a>  Who can discover the face of his garment? [or] who can come [to him] with his double bridle?<br><a name="14">14</a>  Who can open the doors of his face? his teeth [are] terrible round about.<br><a name="15">15</a>  [His] scales [are his] pride, shut up together [as with] a close seal.<br><a name="16">16</a>  One is so near to another, that no air can come between them.<br><a name="17">17</a>  They are joined one to another, they stick together, that they cannot be sundered.<br><a name="18">18</a>  By his neesings a light doth shine, and his eyes [are] like the eyelids of the morning.<br><a name="19">19</a>  Out of his mouth go burning lamps, [and] sparks of fire leap out.<br><a name="20">20</a>  Out of his nostrils goeth smoke, as [out] of a seething pot or caldron.<br><a name="21">21</a>  His breath kindleth coals, and a flame goeth out of his mouth.<br><a name="22">22</a>  In his neck remaineth strength, and sorrow is turned into joy before him.<br><a name="23">23</a>  The flakes of his flesh are joined together: they are firm in themselves; they cannot be moved.<br><a name="24">24</a>  His heart is as firm as a stone; yea, as hard as a piece of the nether [millstone].<br><a name="25">25</a>  When he raiseth up himself, the mighty are afraid: by reason of breakings they purify themselves.<br><a name="26">26</a>  The sword of him that layeth at him cannot hold: the spear, the dart, nor the habergeon.<br><a name="27">27</a>  He esteemeth iron as straw, [and] brass as rotten wood.<br><a name="28">28</a>  The arrow cannot make him flee: slingstones are turned with him into stubble.<br><a name="29">29</a>  Darts are counted as stubble: he laugheth at the shaking of a spear.<br><a name="30">30</a>  Sharp stones [are] under him: he spreadeth sharp pointed things upon the mire.<br><a name="31">31</a>  He maketh the deep to boil like a pot: he maketh the sea like a pot of ointment.<br><a name="32">32</a>  He maketh a path to shine after him; [one] would think the deep [to be] hoary.<br><a name="33">33</a>  Upon earth there is not his like, who is made without fear.<br><a name="34">34</a>  He beholdeth all high [things]: he [is] a king over all the children of pride.<br><br>Go to <a href="job42.htm#1">Job 42</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
