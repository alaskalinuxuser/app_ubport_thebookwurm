Psalms 106<br> 1. Praise ye the LORD. O give thanks unto the LORD; for [he is] good: for his mercy [endureth] for ever.<br><a name="2">2</a>  Who can utter the mighty acts of the LORD? [who] can shew forth all his praise?<br><a name="3">3</a>  Blessed [are] they that keep judgment, [and] he that doeth righteousness at all times.<br><a name="4">4</a>  Remember me, O LORD, with the favour [that thou bearest unto] thy people: O visit me with thy salvation;<br><a name="5">5</a>  That I may see the good of thy chosen, that I may rejoice in the gladness of thy nation, that I may glory with thine inheritance.<br><a name="6">6</a>. We have sinned with our fathers, we have committed iniquity, we have done wickedly.<br><a name="7">7</a>  Our fathers understood not thy wonders in Egypt; they remembered not the multitude of thy mercies; but provoked [him] at the sea, [even] at the Red sea.<br><a name="8">8</a>  Nevertheless he saved them for his name's sake, that he might make his mighty power to be known.<br><a name="9">9</a>  He rebuked the Red sea also, and it was dried up: so he led them through the depths, as through the wilderness.<br><a name="10">10</a>  And he saved them from the hand of him that hated [them], and redeemed them from the hand of the enemy.<br><a name="11">11</a>  And the waters covered their enemies: there was not one of them left.<br><a name="12">12</a>  Then believed they his words; they sang his praise.<br><a name="13">13</a>. They soon forgat his works; they waited not for his counsel:<br><a name="14">14</a>  But lusted exceedingly in the wilderness, and tempted God in the desert.<br><a name="15">15</a>  And he gave them their request; but sent leanness into their soul.<br><a name="16">16</a>  They envied Moses also in the camp, [and] Aaron the saint of the LORD.<br><a name="17">17</a>  The earth opened and swallowed up Dathan, and covered the company of Abiram.<br><a name="18">18</a>  And a fire was kindled in their company; the flame burned up the wicked.<br><a name="19">19</a>  They made a calf in Horeb, and worshipped the molten image.<br><a name="20">20</a>  Thus they changed their glory into the similitude of an ox that eateth grass.<br><a name="21">21</a>  They forgat God their saviour, which had done great things in Egypt;<br><a name="22">22</a>  Wondrous works in the land of Ham, [and] terrible things by the Red sea.<br><a name="23">23</a>  Therefore he said that he would destroy them, had not Moses his chosen stood before him in the breach, to turn away his wrath, lest he should destroy [them].<br><a name="24">24</a>  Yea, they despised the pleasant land, they believed not his word:<br><a name="25">25</a>  But murmured in their tents, [and] hearkened not unto the voice of the LORD.<br><a name="26">26</a>  Therefore he lifted up his hand against them, to overthrow them in the wilderness:<br><a name="27">27</a>  To overthrow their seed also among the nations, and to scatter them in the lands.<br><a name="28">28</a>  They joined themselves also unto Baalpeor, and ate the sacrifices of the dead.<br><a name="29">29</a>  Thus they provoked [him] to anger with their inventions: and the plague brake in upon them.<br><a name="30">30</a>  Then stood up Phinehas, and executed judgment: and [so] the plague was stayed.<br><a name="31">31</a>  And that was counted unto him for righteousness unto all generations for evermore.<br><a name="32">32</a>  They angered [him] also at the waters of strife, so that it went ill with Moses for their sakes:<br><a name="33">33</a>  Because they provoked his spirit, so that he spake unadvisedly with his lips.<br><a name="34">34</a>. They did not destroy the nations, concerning whom the LORD commanded them:<br><a name="35">35</a>  But were mingled among the heathen, and learned their works.<br><a name="36">36</a>  And they served their idols: which were a snare unto them.<br><a name="37">37</a>  Yea, they sacrificed their sons and their daughters unto devils,<br><a name="38">38</a>  And shed innocent blood, [even] the blood of their sons and of their daughters, whom they sacrificed unto the idols of Canaan: and the land was polluted with blood.<br><a name="39">39</a>  Thus were they defiled with their own works, and went a whoring with their own inventions.<br><a name="40">40</a>  Therefore was the wrath of the LORD kindled against his people, insomuch that he abhorred his own inheritance.<br><a name="41">41</a>  And he gave them into the hand of the heathen; and they that hated them ruled over them.<br><a name="42">42</a>  Their enemies also oppressed them, and they were brought into subjection under their hand.<br><a name="43">43</a>  Many times did he deliver them; but they provoked [him] with their counsel, and were brought low for their iniquity.<br><a name="44">44</a>  Nevertheless he regarded their affliction, when he heard their cry:<br><a name="45">45</a>  And he remembered for them his covenant, and repented according to the multitude of his mercies.<br><a name="46">46</a>  He made them also to be pitied of all those that carried them captives.<br><a name="47">47</a>  Save us, O LORD our God, and gather us from among the heathen, to give thanks unto thy holy name, [and] to triumph in thy praise.<br><a name="48">48</a>  Blessed [be] the LORD God of Israel from everlasting to everlasting: and let all the people say, Amen.
