Isaiah  54<br> 1. Sing, O barren, thou [that] didst not bear; break forth into singing, and cry aloud, thou [that] didst not travail with child: for more [are] the children of the desolate than the children of the married wife, saith the LORD.<br><a name="2">2</a>  Enlarge the place of thy tent, and let them stretch forth the curtains of thine habitations: spare not, lengthen thy cords, and strengthen thy stakes;<br><a name="3">3</a>  For thou shalt break forth on the right hand and on the left; and thy seed shall inherit the Gentiles, and make the desolate cities to be inhabited.<br><a name="4">4</a>  Fear not; for thou shalt not be ashamed: neither be thou confounded; for thou shalt not be put to shame: for thou shalt forget the shame of thy youth, and shalt not remember the reproach of thy widowhood any more.<br><a name="5">5</a>  For thy Maker [is] thine husband; the LORD of hosts [is] his name; and thy Redeemer the Holy One of Israel; The God of the whole earth shall he be called.<br><a name="6">6</a>. For the LORD hath called thee as a woman forsaken and grieved in spirit, and a wife of youth, when thou wast refused, saith thy God.<br><a name="7">7</a>  For a small moment have I forsaken thee; but with great mercies will I gather thee.<br><a name="8">8</a>  In a little wrath I hid my face from thee for a moment; but with everlasting kindness will I have mercy on thee, saith the LORD thy Redeemer.<br><a name="9">9</a>  For this [is as] the waters of Noah unto me: for [as] I have sworn that the waters of Noah should no more go over the earth; so have I sworn that I would not be wroth with thee, nor rebuke thee.<br><a name="10">10</a>  For the mountains shall depart, and the hills be removed; but my kindness shall not depart from thee, neither shall the covenant of my peace be removed, saith the LORD that hath mercy on thee.<br><a name="11">11</a>. O thou afflicted, tossed with tempest, [and] not comforted, behold, I will lay thy stones with fair colours, and lay thy foundations with sapphires.<br><a name="12">12</a>  And I will make thy windows of agates, and thy gates of carbuncles, and all thy borders of pleasant stones.<br><a name="13">13</a>  And all thy children [shall be] taught of the LORD; and great [shall be] the peace of thy children.<br><a name="14">14</a>  In righteousness shalt thou be established: thou shalt be far from oppression; for thou shalt not fear: and from terror; for it shall not come near thee.<br><a name="15">15</a>  Behold, they shall surely gather together, [but] not by me: whosoever shall gather together against thee shall fall for thy sake.<br><a name="16">16</a>  Behold, I have created the smith that bloweth the coals in the fire, and that bringeth forth an instrument for his work; and I have created the waster to destroy.<br><a name="17">17</a>  No weapon that is formed against thee shall prosper; and every tongue [that] shall rise against thee in judgment thou shalt condemn. This [is] the heritage of the servants of the LORD, and their righteousness [is] of me, saith the LORD.<br><br>Go to <a href="isa55.htm#1">Isaiah 55</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
