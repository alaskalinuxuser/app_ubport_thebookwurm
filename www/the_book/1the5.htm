1Thessalonians   5<br>1. But of the times and the seasons, brethren, ye have no need that I write unto you.<br><a name="2">2</a>  For yourselves know perfectly that the day of the Lord so cometh as a thief in the night.<br><a name="3">3</a>  For when they shall say, Peace and safety; then sudden destruction cometh upon them, as travail upon a woman with child; and they shall not escape.<br><a name="4">4</a>  But ye, brethren, are not in darkness, that that day should overtake you as a thief.<br><a name="5">5</a>  Ye are all the children of light, and the children of the day: we are not of the night, nor of darkness.<br><a name="6">6</a>. Therefore let us not sleep, as [do] others; but let us watch and be sober.<br><a name="7">7</a>  For they that sleep sleep in the night; and they that be drunken are drunken in the night.<br><a name="8">8</a>  But let us, who are of the day, be sober, putting on the breastplate of faith and love; and for an helmet, the hope of salvation.<br><a name="9">9</a>  For God hath not appointed us to wrath, but to obtain salvation by our Lord Jesus Christ,<br><a name="10">10</a>  Who died for us, that, whether we wake or sleep, we should live together with him.<br><a name="11">11</a>. Wherefore comfort yourselves together, and edify one another, even as also ye do.<br><a name="12">12</a>  And we beseech you, brethren, to know them which labour among you, and are over you in the Lord, and admonish you;<br><a name="13">13</a>  And to esteem them very highly in love for their work's sake. [And] be at peace among yourselves.<br><a name="14">14</a>  Now we exhort you, brethren, warn them that are unruly, comfort the feebleminded, support the weak, be patient toward all [men].<br><a name="15">15</a>  See that none render evil for evil unto any [man]; but ever follow that which is good, both among yourselves, and to all [men].<br><a name="16">16</a>. Rejoice evermore.<br><a name="17">17</a>  Pray without ceasing.<br><a name="18">18</a>  In every thing give thanks: for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus concerning you.<br><a name="19">19</a>  Quench not the Spirit.<br><a name="20">20</a>  Despise not prophesyings.<br><a name="21">21</a>  Prove all things; hold fast that which is good.<br><a name="22">22</a>  Abstain from all appearance of evil.<br><a name="23">23</a>. And the very God of peace sanctify you wholly; and [I pray God] your whole spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless unto the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.<br><a name="24">24</a>  Faithful [is] he that calleth you, who also will do [it].<br><a name="25">25</a>  Brethren, pray for us.<br><a name="26">26</a>  Greet all the brethren with an holy kiss.<br><a name="27">27</a>  I charge you by the Lord that this epistle be read unto all the holy brethren.<br><a name="28">28</a>  The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ [be] with you.
