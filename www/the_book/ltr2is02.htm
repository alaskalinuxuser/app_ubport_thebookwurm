<center><h3><i>What Was Moses Singing About?</i></h3></center>
<dl><dt><dd>Dear child of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob,
<p>
&quot;I will sing unto the LORD, for He has triumphed gloriously, the horse and his rider hath He thrown into the sea.  The LORD is my strength and song and is become my salvation.&quot;<br>So begins this familiar song of victory, as recorded by Moses in <a href="ex15.htm">Exodus 15</a>.
</p><p>Does it intrigue you, as it does me, this concept that God should &quot;become&quot; something on my behalf?<br>We sing because God has undertaken, at His own initiative and expense, to provide for His people in their  time of desperate need.  The children of Israel, standing on Egyptian sand with the sea before them and Pharaoh's armies behind, were in such a condition.  So, God made a way for them.  But note carefully that He did not decree their deliverance from a distance.  In the process of His provision, He involved Himself personally.  In the words of Pharaoh's spiritual advisors: &quot;This is the finger of God.&quot; [<a href="ex8.htm#19">Exodus 8:19</a>]
</p><p>
However, His involvement is much more than finger deep: &quot;Behold God <b><i>is</i></b> my salvation; I will trust and not be afraid, for the LORD JEHOVAH <b><i>is</i></b> my strength and my song, He also <b><i>is become</i></b> my salvation.&quot; [<a href="isa12.htm#2">Isaiah 12:2</a>]
</p><p>
Somehow His very Being and Personality is caught up in His intervention on our behalf, to the extent that salvation becomes an aspect of His Name.  &quot;O that the salvation of Israel were come out of Zion, when the LORD bringeth back the captivity of His people, Jacob shall rejoice and Israel shall be glad.&quot; [<a href="psa14.htm#7">Psalm 14:7</a>]
</p><p>
There is a certain ring to that verse which awakens in our hearts the hope of Israel's Messiah.  Indeed, the name of Salvation and of the Messiah seem blended together: &quot;Behold the LORD hath proclaimed unto the end of the world: Say ye to the daughter of Zion, Behold thy salvation cometh, Behold his reward is with him and his work before him.&quot; [<a href="isa62.htm#11">Isaiah 62:11</a>]
</p><p>
But here is a snag:  God will not share His glory with another, and accordingly He claims &quot;Savior&quot; as His own exclusive title (see <a href="isa45.htm#21">Isaiah 45:21-25</a>).  Is it possible that the person of God is somehow intertwined with the person of Messiah?  Isn't this the thrust of <a href="isa25.htm#9">Isaiah 25:9</a>: &quot;And it shall be said in that day {ie., the day of the Messianic kingdom}, Lo, this is our God, we have waited for Him, and He will save us;  this is the LORD, we have waited for Him, we will be glad and rejoice in His salvation.&quot;
</p><p>
&quot;Behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will raise unto David a righteous Branch, and a King shall reign and prosper, and shall execute justice and righteousness in the earth.  In his days Judah shall be saved, and Israel shall dwell safely;  and this is his name whereby he shall be called, THE LORD OUR RIGHTEOUSNESS.&quot; [<a href="jer23.htm#5">Jeremiah 23:5,6</a>]
</p><p>
Is it any wonder then, that the efficacy of the Holy One extends beyond Israel's borders to the nations?  Addressing His Anointed, the LORD says, &quot;It is a light thing that thou shouldest be my servant to raise up the tribes of Jacob, and to restore the preserved of Israel:  I will also give thee for a light to the gentiles, that thou mayest be my salvation unto the end of the earth.  Thus saith the LORD, the Redeemer of Israel, and His Holy One, to Him whom man despiseth, to Him whom the nation abhorreth, to a servant of rulers; Kings shall see and arise, princes also shall worship, because of the LORD that is faithful, and the Holy One of Israel, and He shall choose thee.  Thus saith the LORD, In an acceptable time have I heard thee, and in a day of salvation have I helped thee:  and I will preserve thee and give thee for a covenant of the people...&quot; [<a href="isa49.htm#6">Isaiah 49:6-8</a>]
</p><p>
For millennia, God's people have prayed ceaselessly for the coming of this One.  &quot;Give ear, O Shepherd of Israel, thou that leadest Joseph like a flock;  thou that dwellest between the cherubim, shine forth.  Before Ephraim and Benjamin and Manasseh stir up thy strength, and come salvation.&quot; [<a href="psa80.htm#1">Psalm 80:1,2</a>]
</p><p>
Perhaps light would be shed upon the above passage, and each of the scripture passages referenced in this letter, by reading, in each case, the word &quot;salvation&quot; in its Hebrew form:  &quot;Give ear, O Shepherd of Israel...stir up thy strength, and come Yeshua.&quot;
</p><p>
Within the walls of Jerusalem's second Temple, aged Simeon stood praying, his face glistening with tears, his arms holding an infant: &quot;Lord, now let thy servant depart in peace, according to thy word: For my eyes have seen thy salvation, which thou hast prepared before the face of all people; a light to lighten the gentiles, and the glory of thy people Israel.&quot; [<a href="luk2.htm#25">Luke 2:25-32</a>]
</p><p>
And you?  Have you seen Him?  The One named Yeshua, in the speech of the nations, is called Jesus. His name is salvation, &quot;for he shall save his people from their sins.&quot; [<a href="mat1.htm#21">Matthew 1:21</a>]
</p><p>I thought you would want to know.
</p><p>Sincerely,<br>A friend</p>
<dt><dt> 
 P.S.:  Perhaps you see a conflict here:  <dd>If Jesus was the victorious one for whom Israel waits, why did he die?  Why have we not yet seen the glorious conditions which the prophets associated with the Salvation of Israel?... The Scriptures clearly teach that the Messiah fulfills two roles: that of the suffering Servant, and that of the conquering King. He came first to suffer. He will come again to reign.
