Psalms 119<br><a name="1"></a> 1. ALEPH. Blessed [are] the undefiled in the way, who walk in the law of the LORD.<br><a name="2"></a> 2  Blessed [are] they that keep his testimonies, [and that] seek him with the whole heart.<br><a name="3"></a> 3  They also do no iniquity: they walk in his ways.<br><a name="4"></a> 4. Thou hast commanded [us] to keep thy precepts diligently.<br><a name="5"></a> 5  O that my ways were directed to keep thy statutes!<br><a name="6"></a> 6  Then shall I not be ashamed, when I have respect unto all thy commandments.<br><a name="7"></a> 7. I will praise thee with uprightness of heart, when I shall have learned thy righteous judgments.<br><a name="8"></a> 8  I will keep thy statutes: O forsake me not utterly.<br><a name="9"></a> 9. BETH. Wherewithal shall a young man cleanse his way? by taking heed [thereto] according to thy word.<br><a name="10"></a> 10. With my whole heart have I sought thee: O let me not wander from thy commandments.<br><a name="11"></a> 11. Thy word have I hid in mine heart, that I might not sin against thee.<br><a name="12"></a> 12. Blessed [art] thou, O LORD: teach me thy statutes.<br><a name="13"></a> 13. With my lips have I declared all the judgments of thy mouth.<br><a name="14"></a> 14  I have rejoiced in the way of thy testimonies, as [much as] in all riches.<br><a name="15"></a> 15  I will meditate in thy precepts, and have respect unto thy ways.<br><a name="16"></a> 16  I will delight myself in thy statutes: I will not forget thy word.<br><a name="17"></a> 17. GIMEL. Deal bountifully with thy servant, [that] I may live, and keep thy word.<br><a name="18"></a> 18. Open thou mine eyes, that I may behold wondrous things out of thy law.<br><a name="19"></a> 19. I [am] a stranger in the earth: hide not thy commandments from me.<br><a name="20"></a> 20. My soul breaketh for the longing [that it hath] unto thy judgments at all times.<br><a name="21"></a> 21. Thou hast rebuked the proud [that are] cursed, which do err from thy commandments.<br><a name="22"></a> 22. Remove from me reproach and contempt; for I have kept thy testimonies.<br><a name="23"></a> 23. Princes also did sit [and] speak against me: [but] thy servant did meditate in thy statutes.<br><a name="24"></a> 24. Thy testimonies also [are] my delight [and] my counsellors.<br><a name="25"></a> 25. DALETH. My soul cleaveth unto the dust: quicken thou me according to thy word.<br><a name="26"></a> 26. I have declared my ways, and thou heardest me: teach me thy statutes.<br><a name="27"></a> 27  Make me to understand the way of thy precepts: so shall I talk of thy wondrous works.<br><a name="28"></a> 28. My soul melteth for heaviness: strengthen thou me according unto thy word.<br><a name="29"></a> 29  Remove from me the way of lying: and grant me thy law graciously.<br><a name="30"></a> 30. I have chosen the way of truth: thy judgments have I laid [before me].<br><a name="31"></a> 31  I have stuck unto thy testimonies: O LORD, put me not to shame.<br><a name="32"></a> 32  I will run the way of thy commandments, when thou shalt enlarge my heart.<br><a name="33"></a> 33. HE. Teach me, O LORD, the way of thy statutes; and I shall keep it [unto] the end.<br><a name="34"></a> 34  Give me understanding, and I shall keep thy law; yea, I shall observe it with [my] whole heart.<br><a name="35"></a> 35. Make me to go in the path of thy commandments; for therein do I delight.<br><a name="36"></a> 36  Incline my heart unto thy testimonies, and not to covetousness.<br><a name="37"></a> 37. Turn away mine eyes from beholding vanity; [and] quicken thou me in thy way.<br><a name="38"></a> 38. Stablish thy word unto thy servant, who [is devoted] to thy fear.<br><a name="39"></a> 39. Turn away my reproach which I fear: for thy judgments [are] good.<br><a name="40"></a> 40. Behold, I have longed after thy precepts: quicken me in thy righteousness.<br><a name="41"></a> 41. VAU. Let thy mercies come also unto me, O LORD, [even] thy salvation, according to thy word.<br><a name="42"></a> 42  So shall I have wherewith to answer him that reproacheth me: for I trust in thy word.<br><a name="43"></a> 43. And take not the word of truth utterly out of my mouth; for I have hoped in thy judgments.<br><a name="44"></a> 44  So shall I keep thy law continually for ever and ever.<br><a name="45"></a> 45. And I will walk at liberty: for I seek thy precepts.<br><a name="46"></a> 46  I will speak of thy testimonies also before kings, and will not be ashamed.<br><a name="47"></a> 47  And I will delight myself in thy commandments, which I have loved.<br><a name="48"></a> 48  My hands also will I lift up unto thy commandments, which I have loved; and I will meditate in thy statutes.<br><a name="49"></a> 49. ZAIN. Remember the word unto thy servant, upon which thou hast caused me to hope.<br><a name="50"></a> 50. This [is] my comfort in my affliction: for thy word hath quickened me.<br><a name="51"></a> 51. The proud have had me greatly in derision: [yet] have I not declined from thy law.<br><a name="52"></a> 52. I remembered thy judgments of old, O LORD; and have comforted myself.<br><a name="53"></a> 53. Horror hath taken hold upon me because of the wicked that forsake thy law.<br><a name="54"></a> 54. Thy statutes have been my songs in the house of my pilgrimage.<br><a name="55"></a> 55. I have remembered thy name, O LORD, in the night, and have kept thy law.<br><a name="56"></a> 56  This I had, because I kept thy precepts.<br><a name="57"></a> 57. CHETH. [Thou art] my portion, O LORD: I have said that I would keep thy words.<br><a name="58"></a> 58. I intreated thy favour with [my] whole heart: be merciful unto me according to thy word.<br><a name="59"></a> 59. I thought on my ways, and turned my feet unto thy testimonies.<br><a name="60"></a> 60  I made haste, and delayed not to keep thy commandments.<br><a name="61"></a> 61. The bands of the wicked have robbed me: [but] I have not forgotten thy law.<br><a name="62"></a> 62. At midnight I will rise to give thanks unto thee because of thy righteous judgments.<br><a name="63"></a> 63. I [am] a companion of all [them] that fear thee, and of them that keep thy precepts.<br><a name="64"></a> 64. The earth, O LORD, is full of thy mercy: teach me thy statutes.<br><a name="65"></a> 65. TETH. Thou hast dealt well with thy servant, O LORD, according unto thy word.<br><a name="66"></a> 66  Teach me good judgment and knowledge: for I have believed thy commandments.<br><a name="67"></a> 67. Before I was afflicted I went astray: but now have I kept thy word.<br><a name="68"></a> 68. Thou [art] good, and doest good; teach me thy statutes.<br><a name="69"></a> 69. The proud have forged a lie against me: [but] I will keep thy precepts with [my] whole heart.<br><a name="70"></a> 70  Their heart is as fat as grease; [but] I delight in thy law.<br><a name="71"></a> 71. [It is] good for me that I have been afflicted; that I might learn thy statutes.<br><a name="72"></a> 72. The law of thy mouth [is] better unto me than thousands of gold and silver.<br><a name="73"></a> 73. JOD. Thy hands have made me and fashioned me: give me understanding, that I may learn thy commandments.<br><a name="74"></a> 74. They that fear thee will be glad when they see me; because I have hoped in thy word.<br><a name="75"></a> 75. I know, O LORD, that thy judgments [are] right, and [that] thou in faithfulness hast afflicted me.<br><a name="76"></a> 76. Let, I pray thee, thy merciful kindness be for my comfort, according to thy word unto thy servant.<br><a name="77"></a> 77  Let thy tender mercies come unto me, that I may live: for thy law [is] my delight.<br><a name="78"></a> 78. Let the proud be ashamed; for they dealt perversely with me without a cause: [but] I will meditate in thy precepts.<br><a name="79"></a> 79  Let those that fear thee turn unto me, and those that have known thy testimonies.<br><a name="80"></a> 80. Let my heart be sound in thy statutes; that I be not ashamed.<br><a name="81"></a> 81. CAPH. My soul fainteth for thy salvation: [but] I hope in thy word.<br><a name="82"></a> 82  Mine eyes fail for thy word, saying, When wilt thou comfort me?<br><a name="83"></a> 83. For I am become like a bottle in the smoke; [yet] do I not forget thy statutes.<br><a name="84"></a> 84. How many [are] the days of thy servant? when wilt thou execute judgment on them that persecute me?<br><a name="85"></a> 85. The proud have digged pits for me, which [are] not after thy law.<br><a name="86"></a> 86  All thy commandments [are] faithful: they persecute me wrongfully; help thou me.<br><a name="87"></a> 87  They had almost consumed me upon earth; but I forsook not thy precepts.<br><a name="88"></a> 88. Quicken me after thy lovingkindness; so shall I keep the testimony of thy mouth.<br><a name="89"></a> 89. LAMED. For ever, O LORD, thy word is settled in heaven.<br><a name="90"></a> 90  Thy faithfulness [is] unto all generations: thou hast established the earth, and it abideth.<br><a name="91"></a> 91  They continue this day according to thine ordinances: for all [are] thy servants.<br><a name="92"></a> 92. Unless thy law [had been] my delights, I should then have perished in mine affliction.<br><a name="93"></a> 93. I will never forget thy precepts: for with them thou hast quickened me.<br><a name="94"></a> 94. I [am] thine, save me; for I have sought thy precepts.<br><a name="95"></a> 95. The wicked have waited for me to destroy me: [but] I will consider thy testimonies.<br><a name="96"></a> 96. I have seen an end of all perfection: [but] thy commandment [is] exceeding broad.<br><a name="97"></a> 97. MEM. O how love I thy law! it [is] my meditation all the day.<br><a name="98"></a> 98. Thou through thy commandments hast made me wiser than mine enemies: for they [are] ever with me.<br><a name="99"></a> 99  I have more understanding than all my teachers: for thy testimonies [are] my meditation.<br><a name="100"></a> 100  I understand more than the ancients, because I keep thy precepts.<br><a name="101"></a> 101. I have refrained my feet from every evil way, that I might keep thy word.<br><a name="102"></a> 102. I have not departed from thy judgments: for thou hast taught me.<br><a name="103"></a> 103. How sweet are thy words unto my taste! [yea, sweeter] than honey to my mouth!<br><a name="104"></a> 104  Through thy precepts I get understanding: therefore I hate every false way.<br><a name="105"></a> 105. NUN. Thy word [is] a lamp unto my feet, and a light unto my path.<br><a name="106"></a> 106. I have sworn, and I will perform [it], that I will keep thy righteous judgments.<br><a name="107"></a> 107. I am afflicted very much: quicken me, O LORD, according unto thy word.<br><a name="108"></a> 108. Accept, I beseech thee, the freewill offerings of my mouth, O LORD, and teach me thy judgments.<br><a name="109"></a> 109. My soul [is] continually in my hand: yet do I not forget thy law.<br><a name="110"></a> 110  The wicked have laid a snare for me: yet I erred not from thy precepts.<br><a name="111"></a> 111. Thy testimonies have I taken as an heritage for ever: for they [are] the rejoicing of my heart.<br><a name="112"></a> 112  I have inclined mine heart to perform thy statutes alway, [even unto] the end.<br><a name="113"></a> 113. SAMECH. I hate [vain] thoughts: but thy law do I love.<br><a name="114"></a> 114. Thou [art] my hiding place and my shield: I hope in thy word.<br><a name="115"></a> 115. Depart from me, ye evildoers: for I will keep the commandments of my God.<br><a name="116"></a> 116. Uphold me according unto thy word, that I may live: and let me not be ashamed of my hope.<br><a name="117"></a> 117  Hold thou me up, and I shall be safe: and I will have respect unto thy statutes continually.<br><a name="118"></a> 118. Thou hast trodden down all them that err from thy statutes: for their deceit [is] falsehood.<br><a name="119"></a> 119  Thou puttest away all the wicked of the earth [like] dross: therefore I love thy testimonies.<br><a name="120"></a> 120  My flesh trembleth for fear of thee; and I am afraid of thy judgments.<br><a name="121"></a> 121. AIN. I have done judgment and justice: leave me not to mine oppressors.<br><a name="122"></a> 122  Be surety for thy servant for good: let not the proud oppress me.<br><a name="123"></a> 123. Mine eyes fail for thy salvation, and for the word of thy righteousness.<br><a name="124"></a> 124. Deal with thy servant according unto thy mercy, and teach me thy statutes.<br><a name="125"></a> 125  I [am] thy servant; give me understanding, that I may know thy testimonies.<br><a name="126"></a> 126. [It is] time for [thee], LORD, to work: [for] they have made void thy law.<br><a name="127"></a> 127. Therefore I love thy commandments above gold; yea, above fine gold.<br><a name="128"></a> 128  Therefore I esteem all [thy] precepts [concerning] all [things to be] right; [and] I hate every false way.<br><a name="129"></a> 129. PE. Thy testimonies [are] wonderful: therefore doth my soul keep them.<br><a name="130"></a> 130. The entrance of thy words giveth light; it giveth understanding unto the simple.<br><a name="131"></a> 131. I opened my mouth, and panted: for I longed for thy commandments.<br><a name="132"></a> 132. Look thou upon me, and be merciful unto me, as thou usest to do unto those that love thy name.<br><a name="133"></a> 133. Order my steps in thy word: and let not any iniquity have dominion over me.<br><a name="134"></a> 134. Deliver me from the oppression of man: so will I keep thy precepts.<br><a name="135"></a> 135. Make thy face to shine upon thy servant; and teach me thy statutes.<br><a name="136"></a> 136. Rivers of waters run down mine eyes, because they keep not thy law.<br><a name="137"></a> 137. TZADDI. Righteous [art] thou, O LORD, and upright [are] thy judgments.<br><a name="138"></a> 138  Thy testimonies [that] thou hast commanded [are] righteous and very faithful.<br><a name="139"></a> 139. My zeal hath consumed me, because mine enemies have forgotten thy words.<br><a name="140"></a> 140. Thy word [is] very pure: therefore thy servant loveth it.<br><a name="141"></a> 141. I [am] small and despised: [yet] do not I forget thy precepts.<br><a name="142"></a> 142. Thy righteousness [is] an everlasting righteousness, and thy law [is] the truth.<br><a name="143"></a> 143. Trouble and anguish have taken hold on me: [yet] thy commandments [are] my delights.<br><a name="144"></a> 144  The righteousness of thy testimonies [is] everlasting: give me understanding, and I shall live.<br><a name="145"></a> 145. KOPH. I cried with [my] whole heart; hear me, O LORD: I will keep thy statutes.<br><a name="146"></a> 146  I cried unto thee; save me, and I shall keep thy testimonies.<br><a name="147"></a> 147. I prevented the dawning of the morning, and cried: I hoped in thy word.<br><a name="148"></a> 148  Mine eyes prevent the [night] watches, that I might meditate in thy word.<br><a name="149"></a> 149. Hear my voice according unto thy lovingkindness: O LORD, quicken me according to thy judgment.<br><a name="150"></a> 150. They draw nigh that follow after mischief: they are far from thy law.<br><a name="151"></a> 151  Thou [art] near, O LORD; and all thy commandments [are] truth.<br><a name="152"></a> 152. Concerning thy testimonies, I have known of old that thou hast founded them for ever.<br><a name="153"></a> 153. RESH. Consider mine affliction, and deliver me: for I do not forget thy law.<br><a name="154"></a> 154  Plead my cause, and deliver me: quicken me according to thy word.<br><a name="155"></a> 155. Salvation [is] far from the wicked: for they seek not thy statutes.<br><a name="156"></a> 156. Great [are] thy tender mercies, O LORD: quicken me according to thy judgments.<br><a name="157"></a> 157. Many [are] my persecutors and mine enemies; [yet] do I not decline from thy testimonies.<br><a name="158"></a> 158. I beheld the transgressors, and was grieved; because they kept not thy word.<br><a name="159"></a> 159. Consider how I love thy precepts: quicken me, O LORD, according to thy lovingkindness.<br><a name="160"></a> 160. Thy word [is] true [from] the beginning: and every one of thy righteous judgments [endureth] for ever.<br><a name="161"></a> 161. SCHIN. Princes have persecuted me without a cause: but my heart standeth in awe of thy word.<br><a name="162"></a> 162. I rejoice at thy word, as one that findeth great spoil.<br><a name="163"></a> 163. I hate and abhor lying: [but] thy law do I love.<br><a name="164"></a> 164. Seven times a day do I praise thee because of thy righteous judgments.<br><a name="165"></a> 165. Great peace have they which love thy law: and nothing shall offend them.<br><a name="166"></a> 166. LORD, I have hoped for thy salvation, and done thy commandments.<br><a name="167"></a> 167.

TAU. Let my cry come near before thee, O LORD: give me understanding according to thy word.<br><a name="170"></a> 170  Let my supplication come before thee: deliver me according to thy word.<br><a name="171"></a> 171. My lips shall utter praise, when thou hast taught me thy statutes.<br><a name="172"></a> 172. My tongue shall speak of thy word: for all thy commandments [are] righteousness.<br><a name="173"></a> 173. Let thine hand help me; for I have chosen thy precepts.<br><a name="174"></a> 174  I have longed for thy salvation, O LORD; and thy law [is] my delight.<br><a name="175"></a> 175. Let my soul live, and it shall praise thee; and let thy judgments help me.<br><a name="176"></a> 176. I have gone astray like a lost sheep; seek thy servant; for I do not forget thy commandments.<br><br>Go to <a href="psa120.htm#1">Psalm 120</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
