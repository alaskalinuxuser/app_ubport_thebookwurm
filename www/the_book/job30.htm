Job  30<br>1. But now [they that are] younger than I have me in derision, whose fathers I would have disdained to have set with the dogs of my flock.<br><a name="2">2</a>  Yea, whereto [might] the strength of their hands [profit] me, in whom old age was perished?<br><a name="3">3</a>  For want and famine [they were] solitary; fleeing into the wilderness in former time desolate and waste.<br><a name="4">4</a>  Who cut up mallows by the bushes, and juniper roots [for] their meat.<br><a name="5">5</a>  They were driven forth from among [men], (they cried after them as [after] a thief;)<br><a name="6">6</a>  To dwell in the clifts of the valleys, [in] caves of the earth, and [in] the rocks.<br><a name="7">7</a>  Among the bushes they brayed; under the nettles they were gathered together.<br><a name="8">8</a>  [They were] children of fools, yea, children of base men: they were viler than the earth.<br><a name="9">9</a>  And now am I their song, yea, I am their byword.<br><a name="10">10</a>  They abhor me, they flee far from me, and spare not to spit in my face.<br><a name="11">11</a>  Because he hath loosed my cord, and afflicted me, they have also let loose the bridle before me.<br><a name="12">12</a>  Upon [my] right [hand] rise the youth; they push away my feet, and they raise up against me the ways of their destruction.<br><a name="13">13</a>  They mar my path, they set forward my calamity, they have no helper.<br><a name="14">14</a>  They came [upon me] as a wide breaking in [of waters]: in the desolation they rolled themselves [upon me].<br><a name="15">15</a>. Terrors are turned upon me: they pursue my soul as the wind: and my welfare passeth away as a cloud.<br><a name="16">16</a>  And now my soul is poured out upon me; the days of affliction have taken hold upon me.<br><a name="17">17</a>  My bones are pierced in me in the night season: and my sinews take no rest.<br><a name="18">18</a>  By the great force [of my disease] is my garment changed: it bindeth me about as the collar of my coat.<br><a name="19">19</a>  He hath cast me into the mire, and I am become like dust and ashes.<br><a name="20">20</a>  I cry unto thee, and thou dost not hear me: I stand up, and thou regardest me [not].<br><a name="21">21</a>  Thou art become cruel to me: with thy strong hand thou opposest thyself against me.<br><a name="22">22</a>  Thou liftest me up to the wind; thou causest me to ride [upon it], and dissolvest my substance.<br><a name="23">23</a>  For I know [that] thou wilt bring me [to] death, and [to] the house appointed for all living.<br><a name="24">24</a>  Howbeit he will not stretch out [his] hand to the grave, though they cry in his destruction.<br><a name="25">25</a>  Did not I weep for him that was in trouble? was [not] my soul grieved for the poor?<br><a name="26">26</a>  When I looked for good, then evil came [unto me]: and when I waited for light, there came darkness.<br><a name="27">27</a>  My bowels boiled, and rested not: the days of affliction prevented me.<br><a name="28">28</a>  I went mourning without the sun: I stood up, [and] I cried in the congregation.<br><a name="29">29</a>  I am a brother to dragons, and a companion to owls.<br><a name="30">30</a>  My skin is black upon me, and my bones are burned with heat.<br><a name="31">31</a>  My harp also is [turned] to mourning, and my organ into the voice of them that weep.<br><br>Go to <a href="job31.htm#1">Job 31</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
