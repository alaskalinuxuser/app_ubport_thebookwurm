Proverbs   9<br>1. Wisdom hath builded her house, she hath hewn out her seven pillars:<br><a name="2">2</a>  She hath killed her beasts; she hath mingled her wine; she hath also furnished her table.<br><a name="3">3</a>  She hath sent forth her maidens: she crieth upon the highest places of the city,<br><a name="4">4</a>  Whoso [is] simple, let him turn in hither: [as for] him that wanteth understanding, she saith to him,<br><a name="5">5</a>  Come, eat of my bread, and drink of the wine [which] I have mingled.<br><a name="6">6</a>  Forsake the foolish, and live; and go in the way of understanding.<br><a name="7">7</a>  He that reproveth a scorner getteth to himself shame: and he that rebuketh a wicked [man getteth] himself a blot.<br><a name="8">8</a>  Reprove not a scorner, lest he hate thee: rebuke a wise man, and he will love thee.<br><a name="9">9</a>  Give [instruction] to a wise [man], and he will be yet wiser: teach a just [man], and he will increase in learning.<br><a name="10">10</a>  The fear of the LORD [is] the beginning of wisdom: and the knowledge of the holy [is] understanding.<br><a name="11">11</a>  For by me thy days shall be multiplied, and the years of thy life shall be increased.<br><a name="12">12</a>  If thou be wise, thou shalt be wise for thyself: but [if] thou scornest, thou alone shalt bear [it].<br><a name="13">13</a>. A foolish woman [is] clamorous: [she is] simple, and knoweth nothing.<br><a name="14">14</a>  For she sitteth at the door of her house, on a seat in the high places of the city,<br><a name="15">15</a>  To call passengers who go right on their ways:<br><a name="16">16</a>  Whoso [is] simple, let him turn in hither: and [as for] him that wanteth understanding, she saith to him,<br><a name="17">17</a>  Stolen waters are sweet, and bread [eaten] in secret is pleasant.<br><a name="18">18</a>  But he knoweth not that the dead [are] there; [and that] her guests [are] in the depths of hell.<br><br>Go to <a href="pro10.htm#1">Proverbs 10</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
