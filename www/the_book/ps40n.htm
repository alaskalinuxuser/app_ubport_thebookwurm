many shall see [it], and fear, and shall trust in the LORD.</b></i></dt><dl>
<dt>a new song- ie., a fresh spring of praise for the new thing which God has done.
<dd>cp. <a href="isa43.htm#19">Isa 43:19-21</a>
<dt>my...our...- The Psalm is almost entirely in the first person singular.
<dd>But here, &quot;my God&quot; becomes &quot;our God&quot; (cp. <a href="joh20.htm#17">Joh 20:17</a>),<br>and the song in &quot;my mouth&quot; becomes the confidence of &quot;many.&quot;
<dd>Our exit from sin's power &amp; entrance into relationship with God were won by One alone.

<dd>2. The Confidence of the Redeemed, v.4-5
<dt><i><b>40:4 Blessed [is] that man that maketh the LORD his trust</b></i> {ie., his hope &amp; confidence},<br> <i> <b>
and respecteth not the proud, nor such as turn aside to lies.</b></i></dt><dl>
<dd>cp. <a href="psa1.htm#1">Psa 1:1,2</a>; <a href="act4.htm#11">Acts 4:11,12</a>; <a href="2tim4.htm#3">2Tim 4:3-5</a>; <a href="2pet2.htm#1">2Pet 2:1</a></dl><dt>
<i><b>40:5 Many, O LORD my God, [are] thy wonderful works [which] thou hast done,<br>
and thy thoughts [which are] to us-ward:<br>
they cannot be reckoned up in order unto thee:<br>
[if] I would declare and speak [of them], they are more than can be numbered.</b></i></dt><dl>
<dt>wonderful works - eg., creation, salvation, justification, adoption, sanctification...
<dt>thy thoughts - He broods over His people, as the Spirit brooded over the
<dd>waters of creation, until His purposes are fulfilled in us.
<dd> <a href="psa139.htm#1">Psa 139:1-6,17-18</a>; <a href="jer29.htm#11">Jer 29:11</a>
<dt>if I would declare and speak of them...- But I cannot.
<dd>His thoughts being above our thoughts, and too numerous to count,
<dd>must be declared to us by Christ. <a href="isa55.htm#8">Isa 55:8-9</a>; <a href="joh1.htm#18">Joh 1:18</a>; <a href="joh17.htm#25">17:25,26</a><a name="6"></a><br>In the following verses, it is He who explains the purpose of His coming.</dl><dt>&nbsp;
<dd>3. The plan of Redemption declared, v.6-10
<dt><i><b>40:6 Sacrifice and offering thou didst not desire;<br>
mine ears hast thou opened:<br>
burnt offering and sin offering hast thou not required.</b></i></dt><dl>
<dt>not required - ie., not asked for, not requested.
<dd>Sacrifice became necessary due to sin.
<dd>The Lord desired to see holy hearts which would obey Him.
<dd>cp. <a href="1sam15.htm#22">1Sam 15:22</a>; <a href="isa1.htm#10">Isa 1:10-20</a>; <a href="hos6.htm#6">Hos 6:6</a>
<dt>mine ears...opened.- This phrase has dual significance...<ul>
<li>The mark of a servant for life. <a href="ex21.htm#5">Ex 21:5,6</a>
<br>Christ was wholly given to the Father's will. <a href="joh6.htm#38">Joh 6:38</a>
<li>The essence of obedience (ears to hear). <a href="isa50.htm#4">Isa 50:4-6</a>
<br>cp. <a href="psa40.htm#6" target="lwr_lt">v.6-8</a> as quoted in the NT: &quot;a body hast thou prepared me.&quot; <a href="heb10.htm#5">&quot;Heb 10:5-7&quot;</a>
<br>So perfect was Christ's obedience that His whole body could be viewed as an ear:<br>totally open to God's Word, totally given to His Will.</ul></dl><dt>
<i><b>40:7 Then said I, Lo, I come:<br>
in the volume of the book [it is] written of me,</b></i></dt><dl>
<dt>the book- ie., the Bible, the record of God's revelation to mankind.
<dd><a href="luk24.htm#44">Luk 24:44-46</a>; <a href="joh5.htm#39">Joh 5:39</a></dl><dt>
<i><b>40:8 I delight to do thy will, O my God:<br>
yea, thy law [is] within my heart.</b></i></dt><dl>
<dt>I delight...- Here is One who desires only what the LORD desires (<a href="psa40.htm#6" target="lwr_lt">v.6</a>).
<dd> <a href="joh4.htm#34">Joh 4:34</a>; <a href="joh6.htm#38">Joh 6:38</a>; <a href="mat26.htm#39">Mat 26:39</a>
<dt>He came (1) to do away with the need for sacrifice (ie., our sinful condition), and
<dd>(2) to establish, within us, His delight in the Father's will.
<dd>After quoting <a href="psa40.htm#6" target="lwr_lt">v.6-8</a>, the writer of Hebrews goes on to explain (in <a href="heb10.htm#8">Heb 10:8-18</a>) that,
<dd>for those who trust in Him, Christ accomplished these things through the substitutionary sacrifice of His body, by which He took away their sin, in order to make them holy.
<dt>thy law... within my heart.- cp.  <a href="jer15.htm#16">Jer 15:16</a>; <a href="jer31.htm#33">Jer 31:33</a>; <a href="2cor3.htm#3">2Cor 3:3</a></dl><dt>
<i><b>40:9 I have preached righteousness in the great congregation:<br>
lo, I have not refrained my lips, O LORD, thou knowest.</b></i></dt><dl>
<dt>preached righteousness...- eg.:
<dd><a href="mat5.htm#20">Mat 5:20-22, 27-28, 31-32</a>
<dt>not refrained...- ie., held nothing back, in the face of opposition.
<dd> <a href="mat23.htm#13">Mat 23:13-36</a>; <a href="mat26.htm#55">Mat 26:55</a>; <a href="joh18.htm#37">Joh 18:37</a></dl><dt>&nbsp;
<dd>4. The price of Redemption paid, v.11-17
<dt><i><b>40:10 I have not hid thy righteousness within my heart;<br>
I have declared thy faithfulness and thy salvation:<br>
I have not concealed thy lovingkindness and thy truth from the great congregation.</b></i></dt><dl>
<dt>This verse reminds us of the way Paul declared the gospel of Christ,
<dd>boldly, freely and without compromise. <a href="act20.htm#20">Acts 20:20-21, 26-27</a>; <a href="rom1.htm#14">Rom 1:14-17</a>
<dd>But, it is Paul's Master, who is speaking here...
<dt>I (Christ) have declared...- <a href="joh17.htm#6">Joh 17:6-8</a>
<dt>...thy lovingkindness and thy truth.- Far from concealing these things, He revealed them,<dd>for Grace &amp; Truth came by Jesus Christ. <a href="joh1.htm#14">Joh 1:14,17</a>; <a href="psa85.htm#8">Psa 85:8-13</a></dl>
<dt><i>
<b>40:11 Withhold not thou thy tender mercies from me, O LORD:<br>
let thy lovingkindness and thy truth continually preserve me.</b></i></dt><dl>
<dt>withhold not...- (This is the same word as &quot;not refrained&quot;, in <a href="psa40.htm#9" target="lwr_lt">v.9</a>.)
<dd>The faithful Servant appeals to His faithful God on the basis of His own faithfulness.
<dd>Here, Christ cries out for the very remedy which He secured for us. <a href="heb5.htm#7">Heb 5:7</a>
<dd>Why?</dl>
<dt><i><b>40:12 For innumerable evils have compassed me about:<br>
mine iniquities have taken hold upon me, so that I am not able to look up;<br>
they are more than the hairs of mine head: therefore my heart faileth me.</b></i></dt><dl>
<dt>evils - not mere &quot;troubles&quot; as some translations propose, but the root of sin itself.
<dd>cp. this word in <a href="gen2.htm#9">Gen 2:9</a>; <a href="gen6.htm#5">Gen 6:5</a>
<dt>iniquities - ie., perversities; not the root only but all of the manifestations of sin.
<dt>mine iniquities- He calls them His own, but they were mine...
<dd><a href="isa53.htm#5">Isa 53:5,6</a>; <a href="2cor5.htm#21">2Cor 5:21</a>
<dt>innumerable...more than the hairs...- They were many,
<dd>because He bore the sins of the whole world. <a href="joh1.htm#29">Joh 1:29</a>; <a href="1joh2.htm#2">1Joh 2:2</a>
<dt>compassed...taken hold upon me...-<dd>My sin, my filth &amp; corruption became the mire of His dungeon (<a href="psa40.htm#2" target="lwr_lt">v.2</a>).
<dt>I am not able to look up...- He bore the shame and horror of sin before the Holy God.
<dd>These sorrows belonged to me. What if He had not come to bear them?
<dt>therefore, my heart fails me.-
<dd>It was not the fear of death but the weight of sin that broke His heart,
<dd>and made His soul &quot;exceeding sorrowful even unto death.&quot; <a href="mat26.htm#38">Mat 26:38</a></dl>
<dt><i><b>40:13 Be pleased, O LORD, to deliver me:<br>
O LORD, make haste to help me.</b></i></dt><dl>
<dt>His petition was not that the cup should pass from Him undrained,
<dd>but that He should be sustained while drinking it,
<dd>and ultimately set free from its power. <a href="mat26.htm#39">Mat 26:39,42,44</a>
<dt>His provision must come only from the LORD.
<dd>He would not intervene on His own behalf. <a href="mat26.htm#52">Mat 26:52-54</a></dl>
<dt><i><b>40:14 Let them be ashamed and confounded together that seek after my soul to destroy it;<br>
let them be driven backward and put to shame that wish me evil.</b></i></dt><dl>
<dt>Some are embarrassed by these words, which they consider too harsh for the gentle Jesus.
<dd>But this is the sinless Savior praying.
<dd>As He was faithful to declare righteousness &amp; salvation, so He pronounces
<dd>judgment on the powers of darkness &amp; on wicked men who came against Him.
<dd>See <a href="isa41.htm#11">Isa 41:11</a>; <a href="isa45.htm#24">Isa 45:24</a>; <a href="mat21.htm#38">Mat 21:38-44</a>
<dd>To those who reject His salvation, there remains no more sacrifice for sins. <a href="heb10.htm#26">Heb 10:26-31</a></dl>
<dt><i><b>40:15 Let them be desolate for a reward of their shame that say unto me, Aha, aha.</b></i></dt><dl>
<dt>...ashamed... confounded... put to shame... desolate... shame...-
<dd>In v.14-15, five different HB words are employed to emphasize the intensity of disappointment, humiliation, and appalling ruin which will befall the enemies of Christ, as a consequence of their stance against Him. The phrase 'driven backward' depicts the complete reversal of their fortunes (foreshadowed in <a href="joh18.htm#6">Joh 18:6</a>). 
<dd>eg., The stance of enemies... <a href="psa22.htm#7">Psa 22:7,8</a>; <a href="psa41.htm#7">41:7-9</a>
<dd>eg., The resulting shame... <a href="mat23.htm#37">Mat 23:37,38</a>; <a href="mat26.htm#63">Mat 26:63,64</a>; <a href="mar14.htm#21">Mark 14:21</a>
<dt>The question that divides all of humanity is: What will you do with Jesus?
<dd>Do you belong with those of <a href="psa40.htm#14" target="lwr_lt">vs.14,15</a>, or with those of <a href="psa40.htm#16" target="lwr_lt">v.16</a>? cp. <a href="isa65.htm#13">Isa 65:13-14</a></dl>
<dt><i><b>40:16 Let all those that seek thee rejoice and be glad in thee:<br>
let such as love thy salvation say continually, The LORD be magnified.</b></i></dt><dl>
<dd><a href="luk1.htm#46">Luke 1:46,47</a>; <a href="rom5.htm#1">Rom 5:1,2</a>; <a href="php3.htm#1">Php 3:1,7-9</a></dl>
<dt><i><b>40:17 But I [am] poor and needy;</b></i></dt><dl><dd> <a href="2cor8.htm#9">2Cor 8:9</a></dl><dt>
<i><b>[yet] the Lord thinketh upon me: </b></i> {cp. <a href="psa40.htm#5" target="lwr_lt">v.5</a>}<br>
<i><b>thou [art] my help and my deliverer;</b></i>
</dt><dl><dd><a href="psa94.htm#17">Psa 94:17</a>; <a href="isa50.htm#6">Isa 50:6-9</a></dl><dt>
<i><b>make no tarrying, O my God.</b></i></dt><dl>
<dt>His story does not end here, as though uncertain of the LORD's answer,
<dd>for we have already heard His song of deliverance, in <a href="psa40.htm#1" target="lwr_lt">vs.1-3</a>.</dl></dl><br>
