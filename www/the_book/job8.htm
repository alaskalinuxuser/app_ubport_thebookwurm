Job   8<br>1. Then answered Bildad the Shuhite, and said,<br><a name="2">2</a>  How long wilt thou speak these [things]? and [how long shall] the words of thy mouth [be like] a strong wind?<br><a name="3">3</a>  Doth God pervert judgment? or doth the Almighty pervert justice?<br><a name="4">4</a>  If thy children have sinned against him, and he have cast them away for their transgression;<br><a name="5">5</a>  If thou wouldest seek unto God betimes, and make thy supplication to the Almighty;<br><a name="6">6</a>  If thou [wert] pure and upright; surely now he would awake for thee, and make the habitation of thy righteousness prosperous.<br><a name="7">7</a>  Though thy beginning was small, yet thy latter end should greatly increase.<br><a name="8">8</a>. For enquire, I pray thee, of the former age, and prepare thyself to the search of their fathers:<br><a name="9">9</a>  (For we [are but of] yesterday, and know nothing, because our days upon earth [are] a shadow:)<br><a name="10">10</a>  Shall not they teach thee, [and] tell thee, and utter words out of their heart?<br><a name="11">11</a>  Can the rush grow up without mire? can the flag grow without water?<br><a name="12">12</a>  Whilst it [is] yet in his greenness, [and] not cut down, it withereth before any [other] herb.<br><a name="13">13</a>  So [are] the paths of all that forget God; and the hypocrite's hope shall perish:<br><a name="14">14</a>  Whose hope shall be cut off, and whose trust [shall be] a spider's web.<br><a name="15">15</a>  He shall lean upon his house, but it shall not stand: he shall hold it fast, but it shall not endure.<br><a name="16">16</a>  He [is] green before the sun, and his branch shooteth forth in his garden.<br><a name="17">17</a>  His roots are wrapped about the heap, [and] seeth the place of stones.<br><a name="18">18</a>  If he destroy him from his place, then [it] shall deny him, [saying], I have not seen thee.<br><a name="19">19</a>  Behold, this [is] the joy of his way, and out of the earth shall others grow.<br><a name="20">20</a>. Behold, God will not cast away a perfect [man], neither will he help the evil doers:<br><a name="21">21</a>  Till he fill thy mouth with laughing, and thy lips with rejoicing.<br><a name="22">22</a>  They that hate thee shall be clothed with shame; and the dwelling place of the wicked shall come to nought.<br><br>Go to <a href="job9.htm#1">Job 9</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
