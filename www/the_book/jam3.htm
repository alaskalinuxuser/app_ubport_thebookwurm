James   3<br>1. My brethren, be not many masters, knowing that we shall receive the greater condemnation.<br><a name="2">2</a>  For in many things we offend all. If any man offend not in word, the same [is] a perfect man, [and] able also to bridle the whole body.<br><a name="3">3</a>  Behold, we put bits in the horses' mouths, that they may obey us; and we turn about their whole body.<br><a name="4">4</a>  Behold also the ships, which though [they be] so great, and [are] driven of fierce winds, yet are they turned about with a very small helm, whithersoever the governor listeth.<br><a name="5">5</a>  Even so the tongue is a little member, and boasteth great things. Behold, how great a matter a little fire kindleth!<br><a name="6">6</a>  And the tongue [is] a fire, a world of iniquity: so is the tongue among our members, that it defileth the whole body, and setteth on fire the course of nature; and it is set on fire of hell.<br><a name="7">7</a>  For every kind of beasts, and of birds, and of serpents, and of things in the sea, is tamed, and hath been tamed of mankind:<br><a name="8">8</a>  But the tongue can no man tame; [it is] an unruly evil, full of deadly poison.<br><a name="9">9</a>  Therewith bless we God, even the Father; and therewith curse we men, which are made after the similitude of God.<br><a name="10">10</a>  Out of the same mouth proceedeth blessing and cursing. My brethren, these things ought not so to be.<br><a name="11">11</a>  Doth a fountain send forth at the same place sweet [water] and bitter?<br><a name="12">12</a>  Can the fig tree, my brethren, bear olive berries? either a vine, figs? so [can] no fountain both yield salt water and fresh.<br><a name="13">13</a>. Who [is] a wise man and endued with knowledge among you? let him shew out of a good conversation his works with meekness of wisdom.<br><a name="14">14</a>  But if ye have bitter envying and strife in your hearts, glory not, and lie not against the truth.<br><a name="15">15</a>  This wisdom descendeth not from above, but [is] earthly, sensual, devilish.<br><a name="16">16</a>  For where envying and strife [is], there [is] confusion and every evil work.<br><a name="17">17</a>  But the wisdom that is from above is first pure, then peaceable, gentle, [and] easy to be intreated, full of mercy and good fruits, without partiality, and without hypocrisy.<br><a name="18">18</a>  And the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace of them that make peace.<br><br>Go to <a href="jam4.htm#1">James 4</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
