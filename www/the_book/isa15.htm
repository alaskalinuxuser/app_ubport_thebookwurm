Isaiah  15<br>1. The burden of Moab. Because in the night Ar of Moab is laid waste, [and] brought to silence; because in the night Kir of Moab is laid waste, [and] brought to silence;<br><a name="2">2</a>  He is gone up to Bajith, and to Dibon, the high places, to weep: Moab shall howl over Nebo, and over Medeba: on all their heads [shall be] baldness, [and] every beard cut off.<br><a name="3">3</a>  In their streets they shall gird themselves with sackcloth: on the tops of their houses, and in their streets, every one shall howl, weeping abundantly.<br><a name="4">4</a>  And Heshbon shall cry, and Elealeh: their voice shall be heard [even] unto Jahaz: therefore the armed soldiers of Moab shall cry out; his life shall be grievous unto him.<br><a name="5">5</a>  My heart shall cry out for Moab; his fugitives [shall flee] unto Zoar, an heifer of three years old: for by the mounting up of Luhith with weeping shall they go it up; for in the way of Horonaim they shall raise up a cry of destruction.<br><a name="6">6</a>. For the waters of Nimrim shall be desolate: for the hay is withered away, the grass faileth, there is no green thing.<br><a name="7">7</a>  Therefore the abundance they have gotten, and that which they have laid up, shall they carry away to the brook of the willows.<br><a name="8">8</a>  For the cry is gone round about the borders of Moab; the howling thereof unto Eglaim, and the howling thereof unto Beerelim.<br><a name="9">9</a>  For the waters of Dimon shall be full of blood: for I will bring more upon Dimon, lions upon him that escapeth of Moab, and upon the remnant of the land.<br><br>Go to <a href="isa16.htm#1">Isaiah 16</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
