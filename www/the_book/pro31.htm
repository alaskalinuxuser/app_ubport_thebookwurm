Proverbs  31<br>1. The words of king Lemuel, the prophecy that his mother taught him.<br><a name="2">2</a>  What, my son? and what, the son of my womb? and what, the son of my vows?<br><a name="3">3</a>  Give not thy strength unto women, nor thy ways to that which destroyeth kings.<br><a name="4">4</a>  [It is] not for kings, O Lemuel, [it is] not for kings to drink wine; nor for princes strong drink:<br><a name="5">5</a>  Lest they drink, and forget the law, and pervert the judgment of any of the afflicted.<br><a name="6">6</a>  Give strong drink unto him that is ready to perish, and wine unto those that be of heavy hearts.<br><a name="7">7</a>  Let him drink, and forget his poverty, and remember his misery no more.<br><a name="8">8</a>  Open thy mouth for the dumb in the cause of all such as are appointed to destruction.<br><a name="9">9</a>  Open thy mouth, judge righteously, and plead the cause of the poor and needy.<br><a name="10">10</a>. Who can find a virtuous woman? for her price [is] far above rubies.<br><a name="11">11</a>  The heart of her husband doth safely trust in her, so that he shall have no need of spoil.<br><a name="12">12</a>  She will do him good and not evil all the days of her life.<br><a name="13">13</a>  She seeketh wool, and flax, and worketh willingly with her hands.<br><a name="14">14</a>  She is like the merchants' ships; she bringeth her food from afar.<br><a name="15">15</a>  She riseth also while it is yet night, and giveth meat to her household, and a portion to her maidens.<br><a name="16">16</a>  She considereth a field, and buyeth it: with the fruit of her hands she planteth a vineyard.<br><a name="17">17</a>  She girdeth her loins with strength, and strengtheneth her arms.<br><a name="18">18</a>  She perceiveth that her merchandise [is] good: her candle goeth not out by night.<br><a name="19">19</a>  She layeth her hands to the spindle, and her hands hold the distaff.<br><a name="20">20</a>  She stretcheth out her hand to the poor; yea, she reacheth forth her hands to the needy.<br><a name="21">21</a>  She is not afraid of the snow for her household: for all her household [are] clothed with scarlet.<br><a name="22">22</a>  She maketh herself coverings of tapestry; her clothing [is] silk and purple.<br><a name="23">23</a>  Her husband is known in the gates, when he sitteth among the elders of the land.<br><a name="24">24</a>  She maketh fine linen, and selleth [it]; and delivereth girdles unto the merchant.<br><a name="25">25</a>  Strength and honour [are] her clothing; and she shall rejoice in time to come.<br><a name="26">26</a>  She openeth her mouth with wisdom; and in her tongue [is] the law of kindness.<br><a name="27">27</a>  She looketh well to the ways of her household, and eateth not the bread of idleness.<br><a name="28">28</a>  Her children arise up, and call her blessed; her husband [also], and he praiseth her.<br><a name="29">29</a>  Many daughters have done virtuously, but thou excellest them all.<br><a name="30">30</a>  Favour [is] deceitful, and beauty [is] vain: [but] a woman [that] feareth the LORD, she shall be praised.<br><a name="31">31</a>  Give her of the fruit of her hands; and let her own works praise her in the gates.<br><br>End of Proverbs.<br>Go to <a href="ecc1.htm#1">Ecclesiastes 1</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
