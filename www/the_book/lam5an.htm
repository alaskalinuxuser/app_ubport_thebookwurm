<dl><dt><b>The Remnant's Prayer, </b>ch. 5</dt><dl><dt>
Chapters 1, 2 and 3 each closed with brief prayers:<ul>
<li><a href="lam1.htm#20">1:20-22</a>, A prayer for vengeance on the perpetrators of violence against Judah.
<li><a href="lam2.htm#20">2:20-22</a>, A prayer of acknowledgment that the national bereavement is due to the LORD's anger.
<li><a href="lam3.htm#55">3:55-66</a>, A prayer, to the One who judges righteously, offering thanksgiving for personal redemption (v.55-58), and requesting a fitting reward for those who have wronged His righteous servant (v.59-66).</ul>
<dt><a href="lam4.htm#1">Chapter 4</a> reviews the actions of the LORD in righteous judgment against His people.<dd>Because of Judah's sins, He has exalted other nations over them, and turned  their blessings into cursings. Yet, someday, He will reverse the situation. Jerusalem's enemies will be judged without remedy. The reason for Jerusalem's punishment will be removed, and the promises of her restoration will be fulfilled. Chapter 4 observes that all of these things are the LORD's doing... both their judgment and their restoration come from Him. Yet, the chapter closes without a prayer.
<dt>Ch. 5 may be regarded as the closing prayer for the previous chapter,<dd>and as the response of the believing remnant to the LORD's work and Word concerning the nation. This chapter breaks the pattern of the previous four, in that it is not acrostic, and it is not set to the qinah {dirge} rhythm. Rather, it is a free form prayer.</dl>
<dt>I. Prayer for Remembrance, <a href="lam5.htm#1" target="lwr_lt">v.1-18</a></dt><dl>
<dt>Remember {HB= zakar, recall to mind} -<dd>The first biblical occurrence of this word is of the Lord remembering those who were saved through judgment (<a href="gen8.htm#1">Gen 8:1</a>). It is frequently used of His faithfulness to keep His covenants (eg. <a href="gen9.htm#15">Gen 9:15</a>; <a href="ex2.htm#24">Ex 2:24</a>). Moses used this word, in appealing to the Lord on the basis of His Covenant (<a href="ex32.htm#13">Ex 32:13</a>). So, here, the prayer of Israel's believing Remnant rests upon the promises of God, which cannot fail (as demonstrated even by the severity of His judgment upon the nation). cp. <a href="lev26.htm#40">Lev 26:40-42</a> (Note the context: Lev 26, like Deu 28, sets forth the conditions of blessing and cursing upon the nation, and closes with the promise of restoration when they turn in confession of their sin.)
<dt>Consider, and behold our reproach - The remnant calls the LORD's attention to the depth of their humiliation.<dd>The thought is: 'We have been humbled. We accept our punishment as deserved (<a href="lev26.htm#41">Lev 26:41</a>).'<ol type="A">
<li>The general condition of the nation (<a href="lam5.htm#2" target="lwr_lt">v.2-10</a>)-<ul>
<li>Our inheritance (ie., the Land) is turned {turned over} to strangers {foreigners} cp. <a href="lev26.htm#32">Lev 26:32,33</a>
<li>We are orphans... fatherless... widows... - People without rights, without means and without security. cp. <a href="lev26.htm#36">Lev 26:36-38</a>
<li>water... wood... sold to us - cp. <a href="lev26.htm#16">Lev 26:16,17,26</a>
<li>necks... under persecution... labor... no rest - cp. <a href="lev26.htm#19">Lev 26:19,20</a>; <a href="deu28.htm#48">Deu 28:48</a>
<li>We have given the hand to {ie., pledged ourselves to serve} Egypt and Assyria... for food -
<li>Our fathers have sinned... we have borne their iniquities (cp. <a href="lev26.htm#39">Lev 26:39b</a>)-<dd>Here, the remnant is not blaming the previous generations for their plight (cp. v.16b), but acknowledging that the foolishness of their predecessors, in entering into ungodly alliances, has contributed to the fall of the nation.</dd>
<li>our bread with peril... our skin black... because of... famine-<dd>Babylon's siege of Jerusalem had prevented the harvest of crops in fields beyond the city walls, and brought intense famine to those within. (Verses 2-10 recall the terrors of the siege. Verses 11-18 rehearse the terrors of the captivity, which followed the fall of the city.)</dd></ul>
<li>The specific sufferings of groups within the nation (<a href="lam5.htm#11" target="lwr_lt">v.11-13</a>)<ul>
<li>The women and girls raped (cp. <a href="deu28.htm#30">Deu 28:30</a>; <a href="zech14.htm#2">Zech 14:2</a>).
<li>The princes tortured and slain (eg. <a href="jer52.htm#24">Jer 52:24-27</a>).
<li>The elders dishonored (cp. <a href="lam4.htm#16">Lam 4:16</a>). 
<li>The young men enslaved to do the work of cattle (cp. <a href="judg16.htm#21">Judg 16:21</a>).
<li>The children {lit., young boys} tasked beyond their strength.</ul>
<li>The over shadowing cloud of woe (<a href="lam5.htm#14" target="lwr_lt">v.14-18</a>): producing a godly sorrow unto repentance (<a href="2cor7.htm#10">2Cor 7:10</a>)<ul>
<li>The elders no longer handle legal matters (cp. <a href="jer39.htm#3">Jer 39:3</a>; <a href="lam2.htm#10">Lam 2:10</a>).
<li>Music and song are silenced (cp. <a href="jer7.htm#34">Jer 7:34</a>).
<li>The crown is fallen... (ie., our former glory has been cast away, cp. <a href="lam1.htm#1">Lam 1:1</a>; <a href="job19.htm#9">Job 19:9</a>; <a href="psa89.htm#39">Psa 89:39</a>).<dd>The Church should take heed (cp. <a href="rev2.htm#10">Rev 2:10</a>; <a href="rev3.htm#11">3:11</a>).
<li>Woe {HB= oy!} unto us, that we have sinned.-  Here, the remnant confesses and repents of sin.<dd>Yet, they are powerless to reverse the damage and restore that which sin has lost.</dd>
<li>Our heart is faint, our eyes are dim...-<dd>The heart of Jeremiah (which reflected that of the LORD) is now reflected in the remnant (cp. <a href="lam1.htm#13">Lam 1:13</a>; <a href="jer8.htm#18">Jer 8:18</a>). They, too, are blinded by their tears, for the effects of sin (cp. <a href="lam2.htm#11">Lam 2:11</a>; <a href="psa69.htm#3">Psa 69:3</a>)... their sin, for which the LORD justly took His Kingdom from them... their sin, which brought dishonor upon His Name and the place of His Name...
<li>...because of the mountain of Zion which is desolate... cp. <a href="jer17.htm#3">Jer 17:3</a>; <a href="mic3.htm#12">Mic 3:12</a></ul></ol></dl>
<dt>II. Prayer for Restoration, <a href="lam5.htm#19" target="lwr_lt">v.19-22</a><dd>Having confessed their sin and owned their judgment, they appeal to the God of the Covenant for restoration (<a href="lev26.htm#40">Lev 26:40-42</a>).<ul>
<li>Thou, O LORD, remainest... (v.19) - Though the earthly city which He chose for the glory of His Name lies desolate,<dd> the LORD continues {ie., He has not been displaced}, His Sovereignty continues uninterrupted (cp. <a href="psa9.htm#7">Psa 9:7</a>; <a href="psa90.htm#2">90:2</a>). There is no other to whom a desolate sinner might appeal for salvation (cp. <a href="isa45.htm#21">Isa 45:21,22</a>; <a href="act4.htm#12">Acts 4:12</a>). It is He who will restore Israel (<a href="psa102.htm#12">Psa 102:12,13</a>). Note that the One identified in Psa 102 is the Messiah (cp. <a href="psa102.htm#25">Psa 102:25-27</a> with <a href="heb1.htm#8">Heb 1:8-12</a>). In that future day, Israel will recognize and turn to Him (cp. <a href="Zech12.htm#10">Zech 12:10</a>; <a href="1tim6.htm#14">1Tim 6:14-16</a>).</dd>
<li>Wherefore dost thou forget us for ever...? (v.20) - Here, the remnant seeks Him with their whole heart (<a href="jer29.htm#13">Jer 29:13</a>).<dd>They plead in desperation, for apart from Him, there is no remedy for their condition (cp. <a href="psa13.htm#1">Psa 13:1</a>; <a href="psa77.htm#7">77:7-10</a>). Compare the prayer of the remnant, previewed prophetically by Jeremiah in <a href="jer14.htm#19">Jer 14:19-22</a>.</dd>
<li>Turn thou us unto thee, O LORD, and we shall be turned... (v.21) -<dd>The remnant knows that they cannot turn their own hearts to God, for their hearts are deceitful and desperately wicked (<a href="jer17.htm#9">Jer 17:9</a>). Salvation from their sinful condition and restoration to the place of blessing can come only when the LORD does His transforming work within them (cp. <a href="psa80.htm#3">Psa 80:3,7,19</a>; <a href="jer31.htm#18">Jer 31:18</a>; <a href="jer32.htm#39">32:39,40</a>).</dd>
<li>But thou hast utterly rejected us; Thou art very wroth against us. (v.22) -<dd>As Jeremiah closes the prayer, it is with the sad recognition that God's wrath against the nation would not soon be lifted (cp. <a href="jer15.htm#1">Jer 15:1-5</a>).<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This verse seems almost too heavy as a final thought. When the Rabbis conclude the public reading of certain books (eg., Ecclesiastes, Isaiah, Malachi, and Lamentations), they repeat the next to the last verse, making it the last, in order to close with a word of comfort. [GWms]<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And so, the day will come when the LORD will accomplish the turning for which the remnant longs in v.21. cp. <a href="eze37.htm#11">Eze 37:11-14</a>; <a href="jer31.htm#31">Jer 31:31-34</a>; <a href="rom11.htm#26">Rom 11:26,27</a></ul><dt>&nbsp;
<dd>Meanwhile, here is an application for our times, by Daniel Webster (as quoted by J.V.McGee):<blockquote>
If religious books are not circulated among the masses and the people do not turn to God, I do not know what is to become of us as a nation. If truth be not diffused, error will be. If God and His Word are not received, the devil and his works will gain the ascendency. If the evangelical volume does not reach every hamlet, the pages of a corrupt and licentious literature will. If the power of the Gospel is not felt through the length and the breadth of the land, anarchy, misrule, degradation, misery, corruption, and darkness will reign without mitigation or end.</blockquote></dl>
