Isaiah   5<br> 1. Now will I sing to my wellbeloved a song of my beloved touching his vineyard. My wellbeloved hath a vineyard in a very fruitful hill:<br><a name="2">2</a>  And he fenced it, and gathered out the stones thereof, and planted it with the choicest vine, and built a tower in the midst of it, and also made a winepress therein: and he looked that it should bring forth grapes, and it brought forth wild grapes.<br><a name="3">3</a>  And now, O inhabitants of Jerusalem, and men of Judah, judge, I pray you, betwixt me and my vineyard.<br><a name="4">4</a>  What could have been done more to my vineyard, that I have not done in it? wherefore, when I looked that it should bring forth grapes, brought it forth wild grapes?<br><a name="5">5</a>  And now go to; I will tell you what I will do to my vineyard: I will take away the hedge thereof, and it shall be eaten up; [and] break down the wall thereof, and it shall be trodden down:<br><a name="6">6</a>  And I will lay it waste: it shall not be pruned, nor digged; but there shall come up briers and thorns: I will also command the clouds that they rain no rain upon it.<br><a name="7">7</a>  For the vineyard of the LORD of hosts [is] the house of Israel, and the men of Judah his pleasant plant: and he looked for judgment, but behold oppression; for righteousness, but behold a cry.<br><a name="8">8</a>. Woe unto them that join house to house, [that] lay field to field, till [there be] no place, that they may be placed alone in the midst of the earth!<br><a name="9">9</a>  In mine ears [said] the LORD of hosts, Of a truth many houses shall be desolate, [even] great and fair, without inhabitant.<br><a name="10">10</a>  Yea, ten acres of vineyard shall yield one bath, and the seed of an homer shall yield an ephah.<br><a name="11">11</a>  Woe unto them that rise up early in the morning, [that] they may follow strong drink; that continue until night, [till] wine inflame them!<br><a name="12">12</a>  And the harp, and the viol, the tabret, and pipe, and wine, are in their feasts: but they regard not the work of the LORD, neither consider the operation of his hands.<br><a name="13">13</a>  Therefore my people are gone into captivity, because [they have] no knowledge: and their honourable men [are] famished, and their multitude dried up with thirst.<br><a name="14">14</a>  Therefore hell hath enlarged herself, and opened her mouth without measure: and their glory, and their multitude, and their pomp, and he that rejoiceth, shall descend into it.<br><a name="15">15</a>  And the mean man shall be brought down, and the mighty man shall be humbled, and the eyes of the lofty shall be humbled:<br><a name="16">16</a>  But the LORD of hosts shall be exalted in judgment, and God that is holy shall be sanctified in righteousness.<br><a name="17">17</a>  Then shall the lambs feed after their manner, and the waste places of the fat ones shall strangers eat.<br><a name="18">18</a>. Woe unto them that draw iniquity with cords of vanity, and sin as it were with a cart rope:<br><a name="19">19</a>  That say, Let him make speed, [and] hasten his work, that we may see [it]: and let the counsel of the Holy One of Israel draw nigh and come, that we may know [it]!<br><a name="20">20</a>  Woe unto them that call evil good, and good evil; that put darkness for light, and light for darkness; that put bitter for sweet, and sweet for bitter!<br><a name="21">21</a>  Woe unto [them that are] wise in their own eyes, and prudent in their own sight!<br><a name="22">22</a>  Woe unto [them that are] mighty to drink wine, and men of strength to mingle strong drink:<br><a name="23">23</a>  Which justify the wicked for reward, and take away the righteousness of the righteous from him!<br><a name="24">24</a>  Therefore as the fire devoureth the stubble, and the flame consumeth the chaff, [so] their root shall be as rottenness, and their blossom shall go up as dust: because they have cast away the law of the LORD of hosts, and despised the word of the Holy One of Israel.<br><a name="25">25</a>  Therefore is the anger of the LORD kindled against his people, and he hath stretched forth his hand against them, and hath smitten them: and the hills did tremble, and their carcases [were] torn in the midst of the streets. For all this his anger is not turned away, but his hand [is] stretched out still.<br><a name="26">26</a>  And he will lift up an ensign to the nations from far, and will hiss unto them from the end of the earth: and, behold, they shall come with speed swiftly:<br><a name="27">27</a>  None shall be weary nor stumble among them; none shall slumber nor sleep; neither shall the girdle of their loins be loosed, nor the latchet of their shoes be broken:<br><a name="28">28</a>  Whose arrows [are] sharp, and all their bows bent, their horses' hoofs shall be counted like flint, and their wheels like a whirlwind:<br><a name="29">29</a>  Their roaring [shall be] like a lion, they shall roar like young lions: yea, they shall roar, and lay hold of the prey, and shall carry [it] away safe, and none shall deliver [it].<br><a name="30">30</a>  And in that day they shall roar against them like the roaring of the sea: and if [one] look unto the land, behold darkness [and] sorrow, and the light is darkened in the heavens thereof.<br><br>Go to <a href="isa6.htm#1">Isaiah 6</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
