<li>The Beginning - <a href="gen1.htm#1">Genesis 1:1</a> - &quot;In the beginning God created&quot;</b>
<p>The first verse of Genesis is dateless and timeless. It belongs to the eternity that is past. Whatever ages are required by geology are provided there.* <i>Time</i> begins with verse 2.</p>
<p>Just three <i>creative</i> acts are recorded: the universe (<a href="gen1.htm#1">v.1</a>), animal life (<a href="gen1.htm#21">v.21</a>), and human life (<a href="gen1.htm#26">v.26,27</a>). The rest of the chapter describes God <i>shaping</i> and <i>making</i>.</p><b>
<li>The method of creation</b><ol type="1">

<li>Angels, including Satan, were created before the earth<ul>
