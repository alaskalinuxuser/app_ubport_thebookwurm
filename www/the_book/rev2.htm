Revelation   2<br> 1. Unto the angel of the church of Ephesus write; These things saith he that holdeth the seven stars in his right hand, who walketh in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks;<br><a name="2">2</a>  I know thy works, and thy labour, and thy patience, and how thou canst not bear them which are evil: and thou hast tried them which say they are apostles, and are not, and hast found them liars:<br><a name="3">3</a>  And hast borne, and hast patience, and for my name's sake hast laboured, and hast not fainted.<br><a name="4">4</a>  Nevertheless I have [somewhat] against thee, because thou hast left thy first love.<br><a name="5">5</a>  Remember therefore from whence thou art fallen, and repent, and do the first works; or else I will come unto thee quickly, and will remove thy candlestick out of his place, except thou repent.<br><a name="6">6</a>  But this thou hast, that thou hatest the deeds of the Nicolaitans, which I also hate.<br><a name="7">7</a>  He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches; To him that overcometh will I give to eat of the tree of life, which is in the midst of the paradise of God.<br><a name="8">8</a>. And unto the angel of the church in Smyrna write; These things saith the first and the last, which was dead, and is alive;<br><a name="9">9</a>  I know thy works, and tribulation, and poverty, (but thou art rich) and [I know] the blasphemy of them which say they are Jews, and are not, but [are] the synagogue of Satan.<br><a name="10">10</a>  Fear none of those things which thou shalt suffer: behold, the devil shall cast [some] of you into prison, that ye may be tried; and ye shall have tribulation ten days: be thou faithful unto death, and I will give thee a crown of life.<br><a name="11">11</a>  He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches; He that overcometh shall not be hurt of the second death.<br><a name="12">12</a>. And to the angel of the church in Pergamos write; These things saith he which hath the sharp sword with two edges;<br><a name="13">13</a>  I know thy works, and where thou dwellest, [even] where Satan's seat [is]: and thou holdest fast my name, and hast not denied my faith, even in those days wherein Antipas [was] my faithful martyr, who was slain among you, where Satan dwelleth.<br><a name="14">14</a>  But I have a few things against thee, because thou hast there them that hold the doctrine of Balaam, who taught Balac to cast a stumblingblock before the children of Israel, to eat things sacrificed unto idols, and to commit fornication.<br><a name="15">15</a>  So hast thou also them that hold the doctrine of the Nicolaitans, which thing I hate.<br><a name="16">16</a>  Repent; or else I will come unto thee quickly, and will fight against them with the sword of my mouth.<br><a name="17">17</a>  He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches; To him that overcometh will I give to eat of the hidden manna, and will give him a white stone, and in the stone a new name written, which no man knoweth saving he that receiveth [it].<br><a name="18">18</a>. And unto the angel of the church in Thyatira write; These things saith the Son of God, who hath his eyes like unto a flame of fire, and his feet [are] like fine brass;<br><a name="19">19</a>  I know thy works, and charity, and service, and faith, and thy patience, and thy works; and the last [to be] more than the first.<br><a name="20">20</a>  Notwithstanding I have a few things against thee, because thou sufferest that woman Jezebel, which calleth herself a prophetess, to teach and to seduce my servants to commit fornication, and to eat things sacrificed unto idols.<br><a name="21">21</a>  And I gave her space to repent of her fornication; and she repented not.<br><a name="22">22</a>  Behold, I will cast her into a bed, and them that commit adultery with her into great tribulation, except they repent of their deeds.<br><a name="23">23</a>  And I will kill her children with death; and all the churches shall know that I am he which searcheth the reins and hearts: and I will give unto every one of you according to your works.<br><a name="24">24</a>  But unto you I say, and unto the rest in Thyatira, as many as have not this doctrine, and which have not known the depths of Satan, as they speak; I will put upon you none other burden.<br><a name="25">25</a>  But that which ye have [already] hold fast till I come.<br><a name="26">26</a>  And he that overcometh, and keepeth my works unto the end, to him will I give power over the nations:<br><a name="27">27</a>  And he shall rule them with a rod of iron; as the vessels of a potter shall they be broken to shivers: even as I received of my Father.<br><a name="28">28</a>  And I will give him the morning star.<br><a name="29">29</a>  He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches.<br><br>Go to <a href="rev3.htm#1">Revelation 3</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
