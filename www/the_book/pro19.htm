Proverbs  19<br> 1. Better [is] the poor that walketh in his integrity, than [he that is] perverse in his lips, and is a fool.<br><a name="2">2</a>. Also, [that] the soul [be] without knowledge, [it is] not good; and he that hasteth with [his] feet sinneth.<br><a name="3">3</a>. The foolishness of man perverteth his way: and his heart fretteth against the LORD.<br><a name="4">4</a>. Wealth maketh many friends; but the poor is separated from his neighbour.<br><a name="5">5</a>. A false witness shall not be unpunished, and [he that] speaketh lies shall not escape.<br><a name="6">6</a>. Many will intreat the favour of the prince: and every man [is] a friend to him that giveth gifts.<br><a name="7">7</a>  All the brethren of the poor do hate him: how much more do his friends go far from him? he pursueth [them with] words, [yet] they [are] wanting [to him].<br><a name="8">8</a>. He that getteth wisdom loveth his own soul: he that keepeth understanding shall find good.<br><a name="9">9</a>. A false witness shall not be unpunished, and [he that] speaketh lies shall perish.<br><a name="10">10</a>. Delight is not seemly for a fool; much less for a servant to have rule over princes.<br><a name="11">11</a>. The discretion of a man deferreth his anger; and [it is] his glory to pass over a transgression.<br><a name="12">12</a>. The king's wrath [is] as the roaring of a lion; but his favour [is] as dew upon the grass.<br><a name="13">13</a>. A foolish son [is] the calamity of his father: and the contentions of a wife [are] a continual dropping.<br><a name="14">14</a>. House and riches [are] the inheritance of fathers: and a prudent wife [is] from the LORD.<br><a name="15">15</a>. Slothfulness casteth into a deep sleep; and an idle soul shall suffer hunger.<br><a name="16">16</a>. He that keepeth the commandment keepeth his own soul; [but] he that despiseth his ways shall die.<br><a name="17">17</a>. He that hath pity upon the poor lendeth unto the LORD; and that which he hath given will he pay him again.<br><a name="18">18</a>. Chasten thy son while there is hope, and let not thy soul spare for his crying.<br><a name="19">19</a>. A man of great wrath shall suffer punishment: for if thou deliver [him], yet thou must do it again.<br><a name="20">20</a>. Hear counsel, and receive instruction, that thou mayest be wise in thy latter end.<br><a name="21">21</a>. [There are] many devices in a man's heart; nevertheless the counsel of the LORD, that shall stand.<br><a name="22">22</a>. The desire of a man [is] his kindness: and a poor man [is] better than a liar.<br><a name="23">23</a>. The fear of the LORD [tendeth] to life: and [he that hath it] shall abide satisfied; he shall not be visited with evil.<br><a name="24">24</a>. A slothful [man] hideth his hand in [his] bosom, and will not so much as bring it to his mouth again.<br><a name="25">25</a>. Smite a scorner, and the simple will beware: and reprove one that hath understanding, [and] he will understand knowledge.<br><a name="26">26</a>. He that wasteth [his] father, [and] chaseth away [his] mother, [is] a son that causeth shame, and bringeth reproach.<br><a name="27">27</a>. Cease, my son, to hear the instruction [that causeth] to err from the words of knowledge.<br><a name="28">28</a>. An ungodly witness scorneth judgment: and the mouth of the wicked devoureth iniquity.<br><a name="29">29</a>. Judgments are prepared for scorners, and stripes for the back of fools.<br><br>Go to <a href="pro20.htm#1">Proverbs 20</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
