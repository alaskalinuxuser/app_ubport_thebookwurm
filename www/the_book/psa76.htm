Psalms  76<br> 1. To the chief Musician on Neginoth, A Psalm [or] Song of Asaph. In Judah [is] God known: his name [is] great in Israel.<br><a name="2">2</a>  In Salem also is his tabernacle, and his dwelling place in Zion.<br><a name="3">3</a>  There brake he the arrows of the bow, the shield, and the sword, and the battle. Selah.<br><a name="4">4</a>  Thou [art] more glorious [and] excellent than the mountains of prey.<br><a name="5">5</a>  The stouthearted are spoiled, they have slept their sleep: and none of the men of might have found their hands.<br><a name="6">6</a>  At thy rebuke, O God of Jacob, both the chariot and horse are cast into a dead sleep.<br><a name="7">7</a>. Thou, [even] thou, [art] to be feared: and who may stand in thy sight when once thou art angry?<br><a name="8">8</a>  Thou didst cause judgment to be heard from heaven; the earth feared, and was still,<br><a name="9">9</a>  When God arose to judgment, to save all the meek of the earth. Selah.<br><a name="10">10</a>  Surely the wrath of man shall praise thee: the remainder of wrath shalt thou restrain.<br><a name="11">11</a>  Vow, and pay unto the LORD your God: let all that be round about him bring presents unto him that ought to be feared.<br><a name="12">12</a>  He shall cut off the spirit of princes: [he is] terrible to the kings of the earth.<br><br>Go to <a href="psa77.htm#1">Psalm 77</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
