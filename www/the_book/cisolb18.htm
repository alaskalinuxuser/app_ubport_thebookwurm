<h2>The Israel Covenant</h2></center>

<p>A covenant is an agreement (similar to a contract) between two parties and involves promises on the part of each to the other. The concept of a covenant between God and His people is one of the central themes of the Bible. At Mount Sinai, the children of Israel entered into a covenant with God, through the Law given to Moses. Under the Law, the question of personal sin must be continually met by sacrifices (<a href="heb10.htm#1">Hebrews 10:1-3</a>). Later, it pleased God to create in Joshua (Jehoshua means Jehovah-Saviour) a wonderful picture of Christ as Deliverer and Leader (<a href="2cor1.htm#10">2Corinthians 1:10</a>; <a href="heb2.htm#10">Hebrews 2:10</a>). God also instituted a new office in Israel, that of Judge, through whom God could work in grace.</p>
<p>The children of Israel were to receive the lessons of the Law, learn the conditions of blessing in the land (Deuteronomy 28, 29), and understand the consequences of disobedience. Their disobedience of the Law led to punishment in the land through droughts, famines, and diseases, and eventually led to the casting out and dispersion of the people.</p>
