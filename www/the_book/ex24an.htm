<dt><b><i>24:1 And he said unto Moses, Come up unto the LORD,<br>thou, and Aaron, Nadab, and Abihu, and seventy of the elders of Israel;<br>and worship ye afar off.<br>
24:2 And Moses alone shall come near the LORD: but they shall not come nigh;<br>neither shall the people go up with him.</i></b></dt><dl>
<dt>worship... afar off...- Under Law, this is the position of man, at his best.
<dd>Contrast the believer's position under Grace (<a href="eph2.htm#13">Eph 2:13</a>; <a href="heb10.htm#19">Heb 10:19-22</a>).</dl><dt>
<b><i>24:3 And Moses came and told the people all the words of the LORD, and all the judgments:<br>and all the people answered with one voice, and said,<br>All the words which the LORD hath said will we do.<br>
24:4 And Moses wrote all the words of the LORD,<br>and rose up early in the morning, and builded an altar under the hill,<br>and twelve pillars, according to the twelve tribes of Israel.<br>
24:5 And he sent young men of the children of Israel, which offered burnt offerings,<br>and sacrificed peace offerings of oxen unto the LORD.<br>
24:6 And Moses took half of the blood, and put [it] in basons;<br>and half of the blood he sprinkled on the altar.<br>
24:7 And he took the book of the covenant, and read in the audience of the people:<br>and they said, All that the LORD hath said will we do, and be obedient.<br>
24:8 And Moses took the blood, and sprinkled [it] on the people, and said,<br>Behold the blood of the covenant, which the LORD hath made with you concerning all these words.</i></b></dt><dl>
<dt>The Covenant (consisting of the Ten Commandments and the Judgments) was read, and...<ol type="a">
<li>accepted by the people (<a href="ex24.htm#3" target="lwr_lt">v.3,7</a>; <a href="ex19.htm#8">Ex 19:8</a>).<dd>
Although their words were commendable, they lacked the capability of fulfilling their vow. cp. <a href="deu5.htm#28">Deu 5:28,29</a>; <a href="rom7.htm#18">Rom 7:18,19</a><dt>
<li>sealed with blood. (<a href="ex24.htm#6" target="lwr_lt">v.6-8</a>)<ul>
<li>The blood speaks of the remission of sin. cp. <a href="heb9.htm#19">Heb 9:19-22</a>
<dd>Israel started their life under the Covenant with a clean slate. They would not be judged for past sins. The people were set apart to the LORD by the blood of the Covenant.<dt>
<li>The blood speaks also of the 'life and death' seriousness of their contract with the LORD.<dd>Israel would suffer severe consequences if they failed to perform what they had promised.</dd><dd>The Mosaic Covenant was 'conditional,' in that its outcome would be determined by whether the people kept it. cp. <a href="deu30.htm#15">Deu 30:15-20</a>
<dt>The blood of the New Covenant is 'better'...<ul>
<li>because the believer's sin is truly removed by Christ's sacrifice, and<br>
<li>because the believer's redemption is fully secured by Christ's work alone.<br><a href="heb9.htm#23">Heb 9:23-28</a>; <a href="heb10.htm#14">10:14-18</a>; <a href="mat26.htm#28">Mat 26:28</a></ul></ul></ol></dl><dt>
<b><i>24:9 Then went up Moses, and Aaron, Nadab, and Abihu, and seventy of the elders of Israel:<br>
24:10 And they saw the God of Israel:<br>and [there was] under his feet as it were a paved work of a sapphire stone,<br>and as it were the body of heaven in [his] clearness. </b></i>{cp. <a href="eze1.htm#26">Eze 1:26-28</a>; <a href="rev4.htm#3">Rev 4:3</a>}<i><b><br>
24:11 And upon the nobles of the children of Israel he laid not his hand: </b></i>{cp. <a href="isa6.htm#1">Isa 6:1-5</a>}<i><b><br>also they saw God, and did eat and drink.</i></b></dt><dl>
<dt>they saw God, and did eat and drink.-<ul>
<li>Based on the blood of the Covenant (which had not yet been broken by disobedience), <dd>the Holy God withheld His hand from exercising judgment against the elders, and granted them access ['they saw God...'] and fellowship ['they... did eat and drink'] in His presence.</dd><dd>The 'elders' (<a href="ex24.htm#9" target="lwr_lt">v.9</a>, HB= zaqen, 'old ones') are called 'nobles' (<a href="ex24.htm#11" target="lwr_lt">v.11</a>, HB= atsiyl, the root meaning is 'set apart ones' or 'near ones') because of this privilege.</dd>
<li>This experience would never be repeated in the history of Israel,<dd>because their failure to keep the Law would exclude them from the presence of the Holy God.</dd>
<li>Note that they did not see God in His fullness, but rather, God revealed something of Himself to them. (cp. Moses' later request to see God's glory, <a href="ex33.htm#18">Ex 33:18-23</a>; also see <a href="joh1.htm#18">Joh 1:18</a>; <a href="joh14.htm#8">14:8,9</a>)

<b><i>24:12 And the LORD said unto Moses, Come up to me into the mount, and be there:<br>and I will give thee tables of stone, and a law, and commandments which I have written;<br>that thou mayest teach them.<br>
24:13 And Moses rose up, and his minister Joshua: and Moses went up into the mount of God.<br>
24:14 And he said unto the elders, Tarry ye here for us, until we come again unto you:<br>and, behold, Aaron and Hur [are] with you:<br>if any man have any matters to do, let him come unto them.<br>
24:15 And Moses went up into the mount, and a cloud covered the mount.<br>
24:16 And the glory of the LORD abode upon mount Sinai, and the cloud covered it six days:<br>and the seventh day he called unto Moses out of the midst of the cloud.<br>
24:17 And the sight of the glory of the LORD [was] like devouring fire<br>on the top of the mount in the eyes of the children of Israel.<br>
24:18 And Moses went into the midst of the cloud, and gat him up into the mount:<br>and Moses was in the mount forty days and forty nights.</i></b></dt><dl>
<dt>Moses went up to receive &quot;tables of stone, and a law, and commandments which I have written...&quot; <a href="ex24.htm#12" target="lwr_lt">v.12</a><dd>He would not come down from the mount until ch. 32.<ul>
<li>We might expect that ch. 25-31 would dwell on the content of the stone tables.<dd>But this subject has already been dealt with thoroughly in ch. 20-24.</dd><dd>The tables of stone were the original 'hard copy' of the Covenant (the Law), of which Moses already had a working copy, and which the people had already accepted (<a href="ex24.htm#3" target="lwr_lt">v.3-4,7-8</a>; cp. <a href="deu4.htm#13">Deu 4:13,14</a>).</dd><dd>(Note also that Moses did not actually receive the tables, until the end of the forty days and forty nights. <a href="ex24.htm#12" target="lwr_lt">v.12,18</a>; cp. <a href="ex31.htm#18">Ex 31:18</a>).</dd>
<li>Contrary to our expectations, ch. 25-31 consist of instructions for the construction of the Tabernacle.<dd>These six chapters provide detailed plans.</dd><dd>Later, another five chapters rehearse these details during the actual construction and consecration of the Tabernacle (ch 35-40).</dd><dd>Evidently, the LORD places particular importance upon the &quot;pattern&quot; of the Tabernacle. (cp. <a href="ex25.htm#9">Ex 25:9</a>; <a href="heb8.htm#5">Heb 8:5</a>; <a href="heb9.htm#1">9:1-24</a>)</dd></ul>
