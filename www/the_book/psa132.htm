Psalms 132<br>1. A Song of degrees. LORD, remember David, [and] all his afflictions:<br><a name="2">2</a>  How he sware unto the LORD, [and] vowed unto the mighty [God] of Jacob;<br><a name="3">3</a>  Surely I will not come into the tabernacle of my house, nor go up into my bed;<br><a name="4">4</a>  I will not give sleep to mine eyes, [or] slumber to mine eyelids,<br><a name="5">5</a>  Until I find out a place for the LORD, an habitation for the mighty [God] of Jacob.<br><a name="6">6</a>  Lo, we heard of it at Ephratah: we found it in the fields of the wood.<br><a name="7">7</a>  We will go into his tabernacles: we will worship at his footstool.<br><a name="8">8</a>  Arise, O LORD, into thy rest; thou, and the ark of thy strength.<br><a name="9">9</a>  Let thy priests be clothed with righteousness; and let thy saints shout for joy.<br><a name="10">10</a>  For thy servant David's sake turn not away the face of thine anointed.<br><a name="11">11</a>. The LORD hath sworn [in] truth unto David; he will not turn from it; Of the fruit of thy body will I set upon thy throne.<br><a name="12">12</a>  If thy children will keep my covenant and my testimony that I shall teach them, their children shall also sit upon thy throne for evermore.<br><a name="13">13</a>  For the LORD hath chosen Zion; he hath desired [it] for his habitation.<br><a name="14">14</a>  This [is] my rest for ever: here will I dwell; for I have desired it.<br><a name="15">15</a>  I will abundantly bless her provision: I will satisfy her poor with bread.<br><a name="16">16</a>  I will also clothe her priests with salvation: and her saints shall shout aloud for joy.<br><a name="17">17</a>  There will I make the horn of David to bud: I have ordained a lamp for mine anointed.<br><a name="18">18</a>  His enemies will I clothe with shame: but upon himself shall his crown flourish.<br><br>Go to <a href="psa133.htm#1">Psalm 133</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
