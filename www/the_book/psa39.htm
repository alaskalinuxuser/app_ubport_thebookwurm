Psalms  39<br> 1. To the chief Musician, [even] to Jeduthun, A Psalm of David. I said, I will take heed to my ways, that I sin not with my tongue: I will keep my mouth with a bridle, while the wicked is before me.<br><a name="2">2</a>  I was dumb with silence, I held my peace, [even] from good; and my sorrow was stirred.<br><a name="3">3</a>  My heart was hot within me, while I was musing the fire burned: [then] spake I with my tongue,<br><a name="4">4</a>  LORD, make me to know mine end, and the measure of my days, what it [is; that] I may know how frail I [am].<br><a name="5">5</a>  Behold, thou hast made my days [as] an handbreadth; and mine age [is] as nothing before thee: verily every man at his best state [is] altogether vanity. Selah.<br><a name="6">6</a>  Surely every man walketh in a vain shew: surely they are disquieted in vain: he heapeth up [riches], and knoweth not who shall gather them.<br><a name="7">7</a>. And now, Lord, what wait I for? my hope [is] in thee.<br><a name="8">8</a>  Deliver me from all my transgressions: make me not the reproach of the foolish.<br><a name="9">9</a>  I was dumb, I opened not my mouth; because thou didst [it].<br><a name="10">10</a>  Remove thy stroke away from me: I am consumed by the blow of thine hand.<br><a name="11">11</a>  When thou with rebukes dost correct man for iniquity, thou makest his beauty to consume away like a moth: surely every man [is] vanity. Selah.<br><a name="12">12</a>  Hear my prayer, O LORD, and give ear unto my cry; hold not thy peace at my tears: for I [am] a stranger with thee, [and] a sojourner, as all my fathers [were].<br><a name="13">13</a>  O spare me, that I may recover strength, before I go hence, and be no more.<br><br>Go to <a href="psa40.htm#1">Psalm 40</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
