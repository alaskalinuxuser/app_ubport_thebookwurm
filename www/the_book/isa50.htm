Isaiah  50<br> 1. Thus saith the LORD, Where [is] the bill of your mother's divorcement, whom I have put away? or which of my creditors [is it] to whom I have sold you? Behold, for your iniquities have ye sold yourselves, and for your transgressions is your mother put away.<br><a name="2">2</a>  Wherefore, when I came, [was there] no man? when I called, [was there] none to answer? Is my hand shortened at all, that it cannot redeem? or have I no power to deliver? behold, at my rebuke I dry up the sea, I make the rivers a wilderness: their fish stinketh, because [there is] no water, and dieth for thirst.<br><a name="3">3</a>  I clothe the heavens with blackness, and I make sackcloth their covering.<br><a name="4">4</a>. The Lord GOD hath given me the tongue of the learned, that I should know how to speak a word in season to [him that is] weary: he wakeneth morning by morning, he wakeneth mine ear to hear as the learned.<br><a name="5">5</a>  The Lord GOD hath opened mine ear, and I was not rebellious, neither turned away back.<br><a name="6">6</a>  I gave my back to the smiters, and my cheeks to them that plucked off the hair: I hid not my face from shame and spitting.<br><a name="7">7</a>  For the Lord GOD will help me; therefore shall I not be confounded: therefore have I set my face like a flint, and I know that I shall not be ashamed.<br><a name="8">8</a>  [He is] near that justifieth me; who will contend with me? let us stand together: who [is] mine adversary? let him come near to me.<br><a name="9">9</a>  Behold, the Lord GOD will help me; who [is] he [that] shall condemn me? lo, they all shall wax old as a garment; the moth shall eat them up.<br><a name="10">10</a>. Who [is] among you that feareth the LORD, that obeyeth the voice of his servant, that walketh [in] darkness, and hath no light? let him trust in the name of the LORD, and stay upon his God.<br><a name="11">11</a>  Behold, all ye that kindle a fire, that compass [yourselves] about with sparks: walk in the light of your fire, and in the sparks [that] ye have kindled. This shall ye have of mine hand; ye shall lie down in sorrow.<br><br>Go to <a href="isa51.htm#1">Isaiah 51</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
