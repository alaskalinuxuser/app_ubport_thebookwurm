Matthew  10<br> 1. And when he had called unto [him] his twelve disciples, he gave them power [against] unclean spirits, to cast them out, and to heal all manner of sickness and all manner of disease.<br><a name="2">2</a>  Now the names of the twelve apostles are these; The first, Simon, who is called Peter, and Andrew his brother; James [the son] of Zebedee, and John his brother;<br><a name="3">3</a>  Philip, and Bartholomew; Thomas, and Matthew the publican; James [the son] of Alphaeus, and Lebbaeus, whose surname was Thaddaeus;<br><a name="4">4</a>  Simon the Canaanite, and Judas Iscariot, who also betrayed him.<br><a name="5">5</a>. These twelve Jesus sent forth, and commanded them, saying, Go not into the way of the Gentiles, and into [any] city of the Samaritans enter ye not:<br><a name="6">6</a>  But go rather to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.<br><a name="7">7</a>  And as ye go, preach, saying, The kingdom of heaven is at hand.<br><a name="8">8</a>  Heal the sick, cleanse the lepers, raise the dead, cast out devils: freely ye have received, freely give.<br><a name="9">9</a>  Provide neither gold, nor silver, nor brass in your purses,<br><a name="10">10</a>  Nor scrip for [your] journey, neither two coats, neither shoes, nor yet staves: for the workman is worthy of his meat.<br><a name="11">11</a>  And into whatsoever city or town ye shall enter, enquire who in it is worthy; and there abide till ye go thence.<br><a name="12">12</a>  And when ye come into an house, salute it.<br><a name="13">13</a>  And if the house be worthy, let your peace come upon it: but if it be not worthy, let your peace return to you.<br><a name="14">14</a>  And whosoever shall not receive you, nor hear your words, when ye depart out of that house or city, shake off the dust of your feet.<br><a name="15">15</a>  Verily I say unto you, It shall be more tolerable for the land of Sodom and Gomorrha in the day of judgment, than for that city.<br><a name="16">16</a>. Behold, I send you forth as sheep in the midst of wolves: be ye therefore wise as serpents, and harmless as doves.<br><a name="17">17</a>  But beware of men: for they will deliver you up to the councils, and they will scourge you in their synagogues;<br><a name="18">18</a>  And ye shall be brought before governors and kings for my sake, for a testimony against them and the Gentiles.<br><a name="19">19</a>  But when they deliver you up, take no thought how or what ye shall speak: for it shall be given you in that same hour what ye shall speak.<br><a name="20">20</a>  For it is not ye that speak, but the Spirit of your Father which speaketh in you.<br><a name="21">21</a>  And the brother shall deliver up the brother to death, and the father the child: and the children shall rise up against [their] parents, and cause them to be put to death.<br><a name="22">22</a>  And ye shall be hated of all [men] for my name's sake: but he that endureth to the end shall be saved.<br><a name="23">23</a>  But when they persecute you in this city, flee ye into another: for verily I say unto you, Ye shall not have gone over the cities of Israel, till the Son of man be come.<br><a name="24">24</a>  The disciple is not above [his] master, nor the servant above his lord.<br><a name="25">25</a>  It is enough for the disciple that he be as his master, and the servant as his lord. If they have called the master of the house Beelzebub, how much more [shall they call] them of his household?<br><a name="26">26</a>  Fear them not therefore: for there is nothing covered, that shall not be revealed; and hid, that shall not be known.<br><a name="27">27</a>  What I tell you in darkness, [that] speak ye in light: and what ye hear in the ear, [that] preach ye upon the housetops.<br><a name="28">28</a>  And fear not them which kill the body, but are not able to kill the soul: but rather fear him which is able to destroy both soul and body in hell.<br><a name="29">29</a>  Are not two sparrows sold for a farthing? and one of them shall not fall on the ground without your Father.<br><a name="30">30</a>  But the very hairs of your head are all numbered.<br><a name="31">31</a>  Fear ye not therefore, ye are of more value than many sparrows.<br><a name="32">32</a>  Whosoever therefore shall confess me before men, him will I confess also before my Father which is in heaven.<br><a name="33">33</a>  But whosoever shall deny me before men, him will I also deny before my Father which is in heaven.<br><a name="34">34</a>  Think not that I am come to send peace on earth: I came not to send peace, but a sword.<br><a name="35">35</a>  For I am come to set a man at variance against his father, and the daughter against her mother, and the daughter in law against her mother in law.<br><a name="36">36</a>  And a man's foes [shall be] they of his own household.<br><a name="37">37</a>  He that loveth father or mother more than me is not worthy of me: and he that loveth son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me.<br><a name="38">38</a>  And he that taketh not his cross, and followeth after me, is not worthy of me.<br><a name="39">39</a>  He that findeth his life shall lose it: and he that loseth his life for my sake shall find it.<br><a name="40">40</a>  He that receiveth you receiveth me, and he that receiveth me receiveth him that sent me.<br><a name="41">41</a>  He that receiveth a prophet in the name of a prophet shall receive a prophet's reward; and he that receiveth a righteous man in the name of a righteous man shall receive a righteous man's reward.<br><a name="42">42</a>  And whosoever shall give to drink unto one of these little ones a cup of cold [water] only in the name of a disciple, verily I say unto you, he shall in no wise lose his reward.<br><br>Go to <a href="mat11.htm#1">Matthew 11</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
