Psalms 109<br> 1. To the chief Musician, A Psalm of David. Hold not thy peace, O God of my praise;<br><a name="2">2</a>  For the mouth of the wicked and the mouth of the deceitful are opened against me: they have spoken against me with a lying tongue.<br><a name="3">3</a>  They compassed me about also with words of hatred; and fought against me without a cause.<br><a name="4">4</a>  For my love they are my adversaries: but I [give myself unto] prayer.<br><a name="5">5</a>  And they have rewarded me evil for good, and hatred for my love.<br><a name="6">6</a>. Set thou a wicked man over him: and let Satan stand at his right hand.<br><a name="7">7</a>  When he shall be judged, let him be condemned: and let his prayer become sin.<br><a name="8">8</a>  Let his days be few; [and] let another take his office.<br><a name="9">9</a>  Let his children be fatherless, and his wife a widow.<br><a name="10">10</a>  Let his children be continually vagabonds, and beg: let them seek [their bread] also out of their desolate places.<br><a name="11">11</a>  Let the extortioner catch all that he hath; and let the strangers spoil his labour.<br><a name="12">12</a>  Let there be none to extend mercy unto him: neither let there be any to favour his fatherless children.<br><a name="13">13</a>  Let his posterity be cut off; [and] in the generation following let their name be blotted out.<br><a name="14">14</a>  Let the iniquity of his fathers be remembered with the LORD; and let not the sin of his mother be blotted out.<br><a name="15">15</a>  Let them be before the LORD continually, that he may cut off the memory of them from the earth.<br><a name="16">16</a>  Because that he remembered not to shew mercy, but persecuted the poor and needy man, that he might even slay the broken in heart.<br><a name="17">17</a>  As he loved cursing, so let it come unto him: as he delighted not in blessing, so let it be far from him.<br><a name="18">18</a>  As he clothed himself with cursing like as with his garment, so let it come into his bowels like water, and like oil into his bones.<br><a name="19">19</a>  Let it be unto him as the garment [which] covereth him, and for a girdle wherewith he is girded continually.<br><a name="20">20</a>  [Let] this [be] the reward of mine adversaries from the LORD, and of them that speak evil against my soul.<br><a name="21">21</a>. But do thou for me, O GOD the Lord, for thy name's sake: because thy mercy [is] good, deliver thou me.<br><a name="22">22</a>  For I [am] poor and needy, and my heart is wounded within me.<br><a name="23">23</a>  I am gone like the shadow when it declineth: I am tossed up and down as the locust.<br><a name="24">24</a>  My knees are weak through fasting; and my flesh faileth of fatness.<br><a name="25">25</a>  I became also a reproach unto them: [when] they looked upon me they shaked their heads.<br><a name="26">26</a>  Help me, O LORD my God: O save me according to thy mercy:<br><a name="27">27</a>  That they may know that this [is] thy hand; [that] thou, LORD, hast done it.<br><a name="28">28</a>  Let them curse, but bless thou: when they arise, let them be ashamed; but let thy servant rejoice.<br><a name="29">29</a>  Let mine adversaries be clothed with shame, and let them cover themselves with their own confusion, as with a mantle.<br><a name="30">30</a>  I will greatly praise the LORD with my mouth; yea, I will praise him among the multitude.<br><a name="31">31</a>  For he shall stand at the right hand of the poor, to save [him] from those that condemn his soul.<br><br>Go to <a href="psa110.htm#1">Psalm 110</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
