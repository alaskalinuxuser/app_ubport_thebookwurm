<dt><b><i>1. I lifted up mine eyes again, and looked,<br>and behold a man with a measuring line in his hand.<br>
2 Then said I, Whither goest thou?<br>And he said unto me, To measure Jerusalem,<br>to see what [is] the breadth thereof, and what [is] the length thereof.<br>
3 And, behold, the angel that talked with me went forth,<br>and another angel went out to meet him,<br>
4 And said unto him, Run, speak to this young man, saying,<br>Jerusalem shall be inhabited [as] towns without walls for the multitude of men and cattle therein:<br>
5 For I, saith the LORD, will be unto her a wall of fire round about,<br>and will be the glory in the midst of her.</i></b></dt><dl>
<dt>behold a man with a measuring line...- In keeping with the Lord's promise in <a href="zech1.htm#16">1:16</a>,<dd>Zechariah sees a man going forth to measure the city of Jerusalem (cp. <a href="eze48.htm#16">Eze 48:16-17,30-35</a>; <a href="rev21.htm#15">Rev 21:15-17</a>; also see <a href="zech_mnu.htm" target="lwr_lt">Book Notes</a> at Zech 1:16,17).
<dt>the angel... said... Run, speak to this young man {HB=na'ar, boy, lad, youth, servant}...-<dd>The heavenly messenger made sure that the Lord's servant, Zechariah, understood the meaning of what he saw:
<dt>Jerusalem shall be inhabited...- The promise of the city's prosperity<dd>would have encouraged the recently returned remnant as they struggled to rebuild.<dd>However, its ultimate fulfillment awaits the time of Christ's millennial kingdom, when He, dwelling in the midst of them, will be their Protector and their Glory. <a href="zech2.htm#5" target="lwr_lt" >v.5</a>; <a href="isa4.htm#5">Isa 4:5</a>; <a href="isa12.htm#6">12:6</a>; <a href="isa26.htm#1">26:1,2</a>; <a href="isa60.htm#18">60:18,19</a></dl>
<dt><b><i>6. Ho, ho, [come forth], and flee from the land of the north, saith the LORD:<br>for I have spread you abroad as the four winds of the heaven, saith the LORD.<br>
7 Deliver thyself, O Zion, that dwellest [with] the daughter of Babylon.<br>
8 For thus saith the LORD of hosts;<br>After the glory hath he sent me unto the nations which spoiled you:<br>for he that toucheth you toucheth the apple of his eye.<br>
9 For, behold, I will shake mine hand upon them,<br>and they shall be a spoil to their servants:<br>and ye shall know that the LORD of hosts hath sent me.</i></b></dt><dl>
<dt>Ho, ho... flee from the land of the north...- &quot;Ho&quot; (HB=hoy, Alas, Woe) is the sound of alarm.
<dd>&quot;The land of the north&quot; is Babylon. Although it is east of Israel, Babylon's conquering armies had approached from the north, because a desert obstructed a direct route. The LORD had used Babylon as an instrument of judgment upon Judah, as He had previously used Assyria (also to the north) in judging Israel, scattering both kingdoms throughout the world (<a href="eze36.htm#19">Eze 36:19</a>). Yet, in His time, His dispersed people will be regathered under one King (<a href="jer3.htm#18">Jer 3:18</a>; <a href="jer31.htm#8">31:8</a>). The warning to flee applies primarily to the Tribulation period, when God's people are warned to escape the impending judgment upon Babylon, the final form of gentile world dominion (<a href="jer50.htm#8">Jer 50:8,9</a>; <a href="jer51.htm#6">51:6,45,50</a>; <a href="rev18.htm#4">Rev 18:4</a>).
<dt>after the glory...- ie., after Christ's return in glory as King (cp.  <a href="zech2.htm#5" target="lwr_lt">v.5</a>; <a href="mat25.htm#31">Mat 25:31-33f</a>),<dd>He will judge the nations according to the way they have treated His &quot;brethren,&quot; the Jewish people (<a href="mat25.htm#40">Mat 25:40,45</a>).
<dt>for he that toucheth you toucheth the apple {HB=babah, center, opening, pupil} of his eye.-<dd>The expression &quot;indicates that which is most precious, most easily injured, and most demanding of protection.&quot; [in quotes, from JVMcGee] (The eye itself is sensitive to touch.) The expression occurs in other places, with differing Hebrew words translated 'apple' (eg., <a href="deu32.htm#10">Deu 32:10</a>, HB=iyshown, lit. 'little man', pupil;  <a href="psa17.htm#8">Psa 17:8</a>, HB=bath, daughter). All three words indicate the viewer's tender regard for, and jealous guard over, the object upon which the Lord's gaze is fixed (ie., Israel).
<dt>the nations which spoiled you:... I will shake... they shall be a spoil...- cp. <a href="isa33.htm#1">Isa 33:1</a><dd>The wrath of the LORD will shake the nations (<a href="isa13.htm#9">Isa 13:9-13</a>; <a href="hag2.htm#6">Hag 2:6-7,21-22</a>).
<dt>...and ye shall know that the LORD of hosts hath sent me.-<dd>In the day that the LORD shakes the nations in judgment, He will remove Israel's blindness concerning the identity of their Messiah (<a href="eze20.htm#41">Eze 20:41-44</a>; <a href="eze39.htm#6">39:6,7,22</a>; <a href="mat23.htm#37">Mat 23:37-39</a>). In that day, the sorrows of their long desolation will give way to unspeakable joy.</dl>
<dt><b><i>10. Sing and rejoice, O daughter of Zion: </b></i>{cp. <a href="isa35.htm#10">Isa 35:10</a>}<i><b><br>for, lo, I come, and I will dwell in the midst of thee, saith the LORD.<br>
11 And many nations shall be joined to the LORD in that day,<br>and shall be my people: and I will dwell in the midst of thee,<br>and thou shalt know that the LORD of hosts hath sent me unto thee.<br>
12 And the LORD shall inherit Judah his portion in the holy land,<br>and shall choose Jerusalem again.<br>
13 Be silent, O all flesh, before the LORD:<br>for he is raised up out of his holy habitation.</i></b> {cp. <a href="isa63.htm#15">Isa 63:15 - 64:2</a>, The remnant's prayer will be answered.}</dt><dl>
<dt>Sing and rejoice... for, lo, I come...-<dd>Though they should have recognized him at His first coming (cp. <a href="psa40.htm#7">Psa 40:7</a>; <a href="zech9.htm#9">Zech 9:9</a>), they did not. But they will rejoice when He comes to them the second time (<a href="isa40.htm#9">Isa 40:9-11</a>).<dd>
<dt>...and I will dwell in the midst of thee...- cp. <a href="eze37.htm#27">Eze 37:27</a>; <a href="zeph3.htm#17">Zeph 3:17</a><dd>Note the repetition of this phrase in <a href="zech2.htm#10" target="lwr_lt">vs.10,11</a>. His Presence with His people, Israel, will...<ul><li>draw the gentile nations near to them and to Him (<a href="zech8.htm#20">Zech 8:20-23</a>; <a href="isa2.htm#2">Isa 2:2-5</a>; <a href="isa52.htm#9">52:9,10</a>). The world will know true peace and salvation.<li>cause Israel to know Him, from whom they had been so long estranged (<a href="joel2.htm#25">Joel 2:25-27</a>).</ul>
<dt>...and the LORD shall inherit Judah... and shall choose Jerusalem again.-<dd>cp. <a href="zech1.htm#17">Zech 1:17</a>; <a href="ex19.htm#5">Ex 19:5,6</a>; <a href="deu32.htm#9">Deu 32:9</a>; <a href="psa132.htm#13">Psa 132:13,14,17</a>
<dt>...in that day...- This phrase, used frequently by Zechariah,<dd>identifies the time when these promises will be fulfilled. They await the Day of the Lord, which includes the Tribulation period (when earth's inhabitants will be confronted with their need for salvation) and the Millennial Kingdom (when the literal presence and reign of Jesus Christ will bring peace on earth).
<dt>Be silent, O all flesh, before the LORD...- cp. <a href="zeph1.htm#7">Zeph 1:7</a>; <a href="psa11.htm#4">Psa 11:4-7</a>; <a href="jer25.htm#29">Jer 25:29,30</a><dd>When the LORD moves to fulfill His Word regarding the judgment of the nations and the restoration of Jerusalem, any voice, foolishly raised in opposition, will be futile. Rather, men will be well advised to stand in awe and submission (<a href="psa2.htm#1">Psa 2:1-12</a>; <a href="psa33.htm#8">33:8-12</a>; <a href="isa14.htm#27">Isa 14:27</a>).</dl>
