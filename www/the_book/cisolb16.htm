<b>Volume 2, Lesson 16</b><br>
by C.I. Scofield
<h2>The Shepherd Work of Christ</h2></center>
<p>Christ is revealed as the Shepherd of the sheep in a three-fold way: He is called the &quot;Good Shepherd,&quot; the &quot;Great Shepherd,&quot; and the &quot;Chief Shepherd.&quot;</p>
<b><ol type="A">
<li>As the Good Shepherd, He:</b><ol type="1">
<li>Gives His life &quot;for&quot; the sheep<ul>
<li><a href="joh10.htm#11">John 10:11</a> - &quot;Giveth His life for the sheep&quot;
<li><a href="joh10.htm#7">John 10:7</a> - &quot;I am the Door of the sheep&quot; 
<li><a href="joh10.htm#9">John 10:9</a> - &quot;Enter in... shall be saved&quot;</ul>
<li>Gives His life &quot;to&quot; the sheep<ul>
<li><a href="joh10.htm#10">John 10:10</a> - &quot;That they might have life... abundantly&quot;
<li><a href="joh12.htm#24">John 12:24</a> - &quot;If it die, it bringeth forth much fruit&quot; 
<li><a href="1joh5.htm#11">1John 5:11</a> - &quot;Hath given... life is in His Son&quot; (see verses 12,13)
<li><a href="joh5.htm#24">John 5:24</a> - &quot;Hath everlasting life... is passed from death unto life&quot;</ul></ol><b>
<li>As the Great Shepherd, He:</b><ol type="1">
<li>Has risen from the dead<ul>
<li><a href="heb13.htm#20">Hebrews 13:20</a> - &quot;Brought again from the dead... great Shepherd of the sheep&quot;</ul>
<li>Cares for the sheep<ul> 
<li><a href="joh10.htm#3">John 10:3</a> - &quot;Calleth His own sheep by name&quot;
<li><a href="joh10.htm#4">John 10:4</a> - &quot;Putteth forth His own sheep... goeth before them&quot;
<li><a href="joh10.htm#27">John 10:27</a> - &quot;My sheep... know... follow&quot;</ul>
<li>Keeps His sheep<ul>
<li><a href="joh10.htm#26">John 10:26</a> - &quot;Believe not, because ye are not of My sheep&quot;
<li><a href="joh10.htm#28">John 10:28</a> - &quot;They shall never perish&quot;</ul> 
<li>Appoints under-shepherds<br>Only the Great Shepherd has authority to commission under-shepherds. The necessary qualification is love for Him.<ul>
<li><a href="joh21.htm#15">John 21:15</a> - &quot;Lovest thou Me more than these?... Feed My lambs&quot;
<li><a href="joh21.htm#16">John 21:16</a> - &quot;Lovest thou Me?... Feed [tend] My sheep&quot;
<li><a href="joh21.htm#17">John 21:17</a> - &quot;Lovest thou Me?... Feed My sheep&quot;</ul></ol><b>
<li>The Chief Shepherd is coming to reward those who love Him and have cared for His sheep</b><ol type="1">
<li>The under-shepherds must:<ul>
<li><a href="1pet5.htm#2">1Peter 5:2</a> - &quot;Feed the flock of God&quot;
<li><a href="1pet5.htm#2">1Peter 5:2</a> - &quot;Taking the oversight... not for filthy lucre [monetary gain]&quot;
<li><a href="1pet5.htm#3">1Peter 5:3</a> - &quot;Neither as being lords over God's heritage, but being [examples] to the flock&quot;
<li><a href="1the2.htm#4">1Thessalonians 2:4-12</a> - &quot;How holily and justly... we behaved&quot;</ul>
<li>Rewards promised to under-shepherds<ul>
<li><a href="1pet5.htm#4">1Peter 5:4</a> - &quot;When the Chief Shepherd shall appear, ye shall receive a crown&quot;
<li><a href="rev22.htm#12">Revelation 22:12</a> - &quot;My reward is with Me, to give every man according as his work shall be&quot;
<li><a href="1the2.htm#19">1Thessalonians 2:19,20</a> - &quot;What is our... crown of rejoicing?... Ye are our glory and joy&quot;</ul></ol>
The three-fold shepherd work of the Lord is wonderfully illustrated by Psalms 22-24. In <a href="psa22.htm#1">Psalm 22</a>, the Good Shepherd is giving His life for the sheep; in <a href="psa23.htm#1">Psalm 23</a> the Great Shepherd is caring for His sheep; in <a href="psa24.htm#1">Psalm 24</a> the Chief Shepherd, the King of glory, comes to reward His sheep.</ol>
