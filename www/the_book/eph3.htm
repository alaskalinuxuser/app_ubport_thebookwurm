Ephesians   3<br> 1. For this cause I Paul, the prisoner of Jesus Christ for you Gentiles,<br><a name="2">2</a>  If ye have heard of the dispensation of the grace of God which is given me to you-ward:<br><a name="3">3</a>  How that by revelation he made known unto me the mystery; (as I wrote afore in few words,<br><a name="4">4</a>  Whereby, when ye read, ye may understand my knowledge in the mystery of Christ)<br><a name="5">5</a>  Which in other ages was not made known unto the sons of men, as it is now revealed unto his holy apostles and prophets by the Spirit;<br><a name="6">6</a>  That the Gentiles should be fellowheirs, and of the same body, and partakers of his promise in Christ by the gospel:<br><a name="7">7</a>  Whereof I was made a minister, according to the gift of the grace of God given unto me by the effectual working of his power.<br><a name="8">8</a>  Unto me, who am less than the least of all saints, is this grace given, that I should preach among the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ;<br><a name="9">9</a>  And to make all [men] see what [is] the fellowship of the mystery, which from the beginning of the world hath been hid in God, who created all things by Jesus Christ:<br><a name="10">10</a>  To the intent that now unto the principalities and powers in heavenly [places] might be known by the church the manifold wisdom of God,<br><a name="11">11</a>  According to the eternal purpose which he purposed in Christ Jesus our Lord:<br><a name="12">12</a>  In whom we have boldness and access with confidence by the faith of him.<br><a name="13">13</a>  Wherefore I desire that ye faint not at my tribulations for you, which is your glory.<br><a name="14">14</a>. For this cause I bow my knees unto the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,<br><a name="15">15</a>  Of whom the whole family in heaven and earth is named,<br><a name="16">16</a>  That he would grant you, according to the riches of his glory, to be strengthened with might by his Spirit in the inner man;<br><a name="17">17</a>  That Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith; that ye, being rooted and grounded in love,<br><a name="18">18</a>  May be able to comprehend with all saints what [is] the breadth, and length, and depth, and height;<br><a name="19">19</a>  And to know the love of Christ, which passeth knowledge, that ye might be filled with all the fulness of God.<br><a name="20">20</a>  Now unto him that is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think, according to the power that worketh in us,<br><a name="21">21</a>  Unto him [be] glory in the church by Christ Jesus throughout all ages, world without end.
