Ecclesiastes   3<br>1. To every [thing there is] a season, and a time to every purpose under the heaven:<br><a name="2">2</a>  A time to be born, and a time to die; a time to plant, and a time to pluck up [that which is] planted;<br><a name="3">3</a>  A time to kill, and a time to heal; a time to break down, and a time to build up;<br><a name="4">4</a>  A time to weep, and a time to laugh; a time to mourn, and a time to dance;<br><a name="5">5</a>  A time to cast away stones, and a time to gather stones together; a time to embrace, and a time to refrain from embracing;<br><a name="6">6</a>  A time to get, and a time to lose; a time to keep, and a time to cast away;<br><a name="7">7</a>  A time to rend, and a time to sew; a time to keep silence, and a time to speak;<br><a name="8">8</a>  A time to love, and a time to hate; a time of war, and a time of peace.<br><a name="9">9</a>  What profit hath he that worketh in that wherein he laboureth?<br><a name="10">10</a>  I have seen the travail, which God hath given to the sons of men to be exercised in it.<br><a name="11">11</a>. He hath made every [thing] beautiful in his time: also he hath set the world in their heart, so that no man can find out the work that God maketh from the beginning to the end.<br><a name="12">12</a>  I know that [there is] no good in them, but for [a man] to rejoice, and to do good in his life.<br><a name="13">13</a>  And also that every man should eat and drink, and enjoy the good of all his labour, it [is] the gift of God.<br><a name="14">14</a>  I know that, whatsoever God doeth, it shall be for ever: nothing can be put to it, nor any thing taken from it: and God doeth [it], that [men] should fear before him.<br><a name="15">15</a>  That which hath been is now; and that which is to be hath already been; and God requireth that which is past.<br><a name="16">16</a>. And moreover I saw under the sun the place of judgment, [that] wickedness [was] there; and the place of righteousness, [that] iniquity [was] there.<br><a name="17">17</a>  I said in mine heart, God shall judge the righteous and the wicked: for [there is] a time there for every purpose and for every work.<br><a name="18">18</a>  I said in mine heart concerning the estate of the sons of men, that God might manifest them, and that they might see that they themselves are beasts.<br><a name="19">19</a>  For that which befalleth the sons of men befalleth beasts; even one thing befalleth them: as the one dieth, so dieth the other; yea, they have all one breath; so that a man hath no preeminence above a beast: for all [is] vanity.<br><a name="20">20</a>  All go unto one place; all are of the dust, and all turn to dust again.<br><a name="21">21</a>  Who knoweth the spirit of man that goeth upward, and the spirit of the beast that goeth downward to the earth?<br><a name="22">22</a>  Wherefore I perceive that [there is] nothing better, than that a man should rejoice in his own works; for that [is] his portion: for who shall bring him to see what shall be after him?<br><br>Go to <a href="ecc4.htm#1">Ecclesiastes 4</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
