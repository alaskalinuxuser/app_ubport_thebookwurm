What advantage then hath the Jew? or what profit [is there] of circumcision?<br><a name="2">2</a>  Much every way: chiefly, because that unto them were committed the oracles of God.<br><a name="3">3</a>  For what if some did not believe? shall their unbelief make the faith of God without effect?<br><a name="4">4</a>  God forbid: yea, let God be true, but every man a liar; as it is written, That thou mightest be justified in thy sayings, and mightest overcome when thou art judged.<br><a name="5">5</a>  But if our unrighteousness commend the righteousness of God, what shall we say? [Is] God unrighteous who taketh vengeance? (I speak as a man)<br><a name="6">6</a>  God forbid: for then how shall God judge the world?<br><a name="7">7</a>  For if the truth of God hath more abounded through my lie unto his glory; why yet am I also judged as a sinner?<br><a name="8">8</a>  And not [rather], (as we be slanderously reported, and as some affirm that we say,) Let us do evil, that good may come? whose damnation is just.<br><a name="9"></a> 9  What then? are we better [than they]? No, in no wise: for we have before proved both Jews and Gentiles, that they are all under sin;<br><a name="10">10</a>  As it is written, There is none righteous, no, not one:<br><a name="11">11</a>  There is none that understandeth, there is none that seeketh after God.<br><a name="12">12</a>  They are all gone out of the way, they are together become unprofitable; there is none that doeth good, no, not one.<br><a name="13">13</a>  Their throat [is] an open sepulchre; with their tongues they have used deceit; the poison of asps [is] under their lips:<br><a name="14">14</a>  Whose mouth [is] full of cursing and bitterness:<br><a name="15">15</a>  Their feet [are] swift to shed blood:<br><a name="16">16</a>  Destruction and misery [are] in their ways:<br><a name="17">17</a>  And the way of peace have they not known:<br><a name="18">18</a>  There is no fear of God before their eyes.<br><a name="19">19</a>. Now we know that what things soever the law saith, it saith to them who are under the law: that every mouth may be stopped, and all the world may become guilty before God.<br><a name="20">20</a>  Therefore by the deeds of the law there shall no flesh be justified in his sight: for by the law [is] the knowledge of sin.<br><a name="21">21</a>  But now the righteousness of God without the law is manifested, being witnessed by the law and the prophets;<br><a name="22">22</a>  Even the righteousness of God [which is] by faith of Jesus Christ unto all and upon all them that believe: for there is no difference:<br><a name="23">23</a>  For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;<br><a name="24">24</a>  Being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus:<br><a name="25">25</a>  Whom God hath set forth [to be] a propitiation through faith in his blood, to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that are past, through the forbearance of God;<br><a name="26">26</a>  To declare, [I say], at this time his righteousness: that he might be just, and the justifier of him which believeth in Jesus.<br><a name="27">27</a>  Where [is] boasting then? It is excluded. By what law? of works? Nay: but by the law of faith.<br><a name="28">28</a>  Therefore we conclude that a man is justified by faith without the deeds of the law.<br><a name="29">29</a>  [Is he] the God of the Jews only? [is he] not also of the Gentiles? Yes, of the Gentiles also:<br><a name="30">30</a>  Seeing [it is] one God, which shall justify the circumcision by faith, and uncircumcision through faith.<br><a name="31">31</a>  Do we then make void the law through faith? God forbid: yea, we establish the law.<br><br>Go to <a href="rom4.htm#1">Romans 4</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
