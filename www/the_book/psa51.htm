Psalms  51<br>1. To the chief Musician, A Psalm of David, when Nathan the prophet came unto him, after he had gone in to Bathsheba. Have mercy upon me, O God, according to thy lovingkindness: according unto the multitude of thy tender mercies blot out my transgressions.<br><a name="2">2</a>  Wash me throughly from mine iniquity, and cleanse me from my sin.<br><a name="3">3</a>  For I acknowledge my transgressions: and my sin [is] ever before me.<br><a name="4">4</a>  Against thee, thee only, have I sinned, and done [this] evil in thy sight: that thou mightest be justified when thou speakest, [and] be clear when thou judgest.<br><a name="5">5</a>  Behold, I was shapen in iniquity; and in sin did my mother conceive me.<br><a name="6">6</a>  Behold, thou desirest truth in the inward parts: and in the hidden [part] thou shalt make me to know wisdom.<br><a name="7">7</a>. Purge me with hyssop, and I shall be clean: wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow.<br><a name="8">8</a>  Make me to hear joy and gladness; [that] the bones [which] thou hast broken may rejoice.<br><a name="9">9</a>  Hide thy face from my sins, and blot out all mine iniquities.<br><a name="10">10</a>  Create in me a clean heart, O God; and renew a right spirit within me.<br><a name="11">11</a>  Cast me not away from thy presence; and take not thy holy spirit from me.<br><a name="12">12</a>  Restore unto me the joy of thy salvation; and uphold me [with thy] free spirit.<br><a name="13">13</a>  [Then] will I teach transgressors thy ways; and sinners shall be converted unto thee.<br><a name="14">14</a>. Deliver me from bloodguiltiness, O God, thou God of my salvation: [and] my tongue shall sing aloud of thy righteousness.<br><a name="15">15</a>  O Lord, open thou my lips; and my mouth shall shew forth thy praise.<br><a name="16">16</a>  For thou desirest not sacrifice; else would I give [it]: thou delightest not in burnt offering.<br><a name="17">17</a>  The sacrifices of God [are] a broken spirit: a broken and a contrite heart, O God, thou wilt not despise.<br><a name="18">18</a>  Do good in thy good pleasure unto Zion: build thou the walls of Jerusalem.<br><a name="19">19</a>  Then shalt thou be pleased with the sacrifices of righteousness, with burnt offering and whole burnt offering: then shall they offer bullocks upon thine altar.<br><br>Go to <a href="psa52.htm#1">Psalm 52</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
