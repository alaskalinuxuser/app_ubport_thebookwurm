Ezekiel  29<br> 1. In the tenth year, in the tenth [month], in the twelfth [day] of the month, the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,<br><a name="2">2</a>  Son of man, set thy face against Pharaoh king of Egypt, and prophesy against him, and against all Egypt:<br><a name="3">3</a>  Speak, and say, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I [am] against thee, Pharaoh king of Egypt, the great dragon that lieth in the midst of his rivers, which hath said, My river [is] mine own, and I have made [it] for myself.<br><a name="4">4</a>  But I will put hooks in thy jaws, and I will cause the fish of thy rivers to stick unto thy scales, and I will bring thee up out of the midst of thy rivers, and all the fish of thy rivers shall stick unto thy scales.<br><a name="5">5</a>  And I will leave thee [thrown] into the wilderness, thee and all the fish of thy rivers: thou shalt fall upon the open fields; thou shalt not be brought together, nor gathered: I have given thee for meat to the beasts of the field and to the fowls of the heaven.<br><a name="6">6</a>  And all the inhabitants of Egypt shall know that I [am] the LORD, because they have been a staff of reed to the house of Israel.<br><a name="7">7</a>  When they took hold of thee by thy hand, thou didst break, and rend all their shoulder: and when they leaned upon thee, thou brakest, and madest all their loins to be at a stand.<br><a name="8">8</a>. Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I will bring a sword upon thee, and cut off man and beast out of thee.<br><a name="9">9</a>  And the land of Egypt shall be desolate and waste; and they shall know that I [am] the LORD: because he hath said, The river [is] mine, and I have made [it].<br><a name="10">10</a>  Behold, therefore I [am] against thee, and against thy rivers, and I will make the land of Egypt utterly waste [and] desolate, from the tower of Syene even unto the border of Ethiopia.<br><a name="11">11</a>  No foot of man shall pass through it, nor foot of beast shall pass through it, neither shall it be inhabited forty years.<br><a name="12">12</a>  And I will make the land of Egypt desolate in the midst of the countries [that are] desolate, and her cities among the cities [that are] laid waste shall be desolate forty years: and I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations, and will disperse them through the countries.<br><a name="13">13</a>  Yet thus saith the Lord GOD; At the end of forty years will I gather the Egyptians from the people whither they were scattered:<br><a name="14">14</a>  And I will bring again the captivity of Egypt, and will cause them to return [into] the land of Pathros, into the land of their habitation; and they shall be there a base kingdom.<br><a name="15">15</a>  It shall be the basest of the kingdoms; neither shall it exalt itself any more above the nations: for I will diminish them, that they shall no more rule over the nations.<br><a name="16">16</a>  And it shall be no more the confidence of the house of Israel, which bringeth [their] iniquity to remembrance, when they shall look after them: but they shall know that I [am] the Lord GOD.<br><a name="17">17</a>. And it came to pass in the seven and twentieth year, in the first [month], in the first [day] of the month, the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,<br><a name="18">18</a>  Son of man, Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon caused his army to serve a great service against Tyrus: every head [was] made bald, and every shoulder [was] peeled: yet had he no wages, nor his army, for Tyrus, for the service that he had served against it:<br><a name="19">19</a>  Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I will give the land of Egypt unto Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon; and he shall take her multitude, and take her spoil, and take her prey; and it shall be the wages for his army.<br><a name="20">20</a>  I have given him the land of Egypt [for] his labour wherewith he served against it, because they wrought for me, saith the Lord GOD.<br><a name="21">21</a>  In that day will I cause the horn of the house of Israel to bud forth, and I will give thee the opening of the mouth in the midst of them; and they shall know that I [am] the LORD.<br><br>Go to <a href="eze30.htm#1">Ezekiel 30</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
