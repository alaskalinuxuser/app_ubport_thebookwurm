I am the true vine, and my Father is the husbandman.<br><a name="2">2</a>  Every branch in me that beareth not fruit he taketh away: and every [branch] that beareth fruit, he purgeth it, that it may bring forth more fruit.<br><a name="3">3</a>  Now ye are clean through the word which I have spoken unto you.<br><a name="4">4</a>  Abide in me, and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself, except it abide in the vine; no more can ye, except ye abide in me.<br><a name="5">5</a>  I am the vine, ye [are] the branches: He that abideth in me, and I in him, the same bringeth forth much fruit: for without me ye can do nothing.<br><a name="6">6</a>  If a man abide not in me, he is cast forth as a branch, and is withered; and men gather them, and cast [them] into the fire, and they are burned.<br><a name="7">7</a>  If ye abide in me, and my words abide in you, ye shall ask what ye will, and it shall be done unto you.<br><a name="8">8</a>  Herein is my Father glorified, that ye bear much fruit; so shall ye be my disciples.<br><a name="9">9</a>. As the Father hath loved me, so have I loved you: continue ye in my love.<br><a name="10">10</a>  If ye keep my commandments, ye shall abide in my love; even as I have kept my Father's commandments, and abide in his love.<br><a name="11">11</a>  These things have I spoken unto you, that my joy might remain in you, and [that] your joy might be full.<br><a name="12">12</a>  This is my commandment, That ye love one another, as I have loved you.<br><a name="13">13</a>  Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends.<br><a name="14">14</a>  Ye are my friends, if ye do whatsoever I command you.<br><a name="15">15</a>  Henceforth I call you not servants; for the servant knoweth not what his lord doeth: but I have called you friends; for all things that I have heard of my Father I have made known unto you.<br><a name="16">16</a>  Ye have not chosen me, but I have chosen you, and ordained you, that ye should go and bring forth fruit, and [that] your fruit should remain: that whatsoever ye shall ask of the Father in my name, he may give it you.<br><a name="17">17</a>  These things I command you, that ye love one another.<br><a name="18">18</a>. If the world hate you, ye know that it hated me before [it hated] you.<br><a name="19">19</a>  If ye were of the world, the world would love his own: but because ye are not of the world, but I have chosen you out of the world, therefore the world hateth you.<br><a name="20">20</a>  Remember the word that I said unto you, The servant is not greater than his lord. If they have persecuted me, they will also persecute you; if they have kept my saying, they will keep yours also.<br><a name="21">21</a>  But all these things will they do unto you for my name's sake, because they know not him that sent me.<br><a name="22">22</a>  If I had not come and spoken unto them, they had not had sin: but now they have no cloke for their sin.<br><a name="23">23</a>  He that hateth me hateth my Father also.<br><a name="24">24</a>  If I had not done among them the works which none other man did, they had not had sin: but now have they both seen and hated both me and my Father.<br><a name="25">25</a>  But [this cometh to pass], that the word might be fulfilled that is written in their law, They hated me without a cause.<br><a name="26">26</a>. But when the Comforter is come, whom I will send unto you from the Father, [even] the Spirit of truth, which proceedeth from the Father, he shall testify of me:<br><a name="27">27</a>  And ye also shall bear witness, because ye have been with me from the beginning.<br><br>Go to <a href="joh16.htm#1">John 16</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
