<dt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Brazen Altar (<a href="ex27.htm#1" target="lwr_lt">v.1-8</a>) -
<dt><b><i>27:1 And thou shalt make an altar [of] shittim wood,<br>five cubits long, and five cubits broad; the altar shall be foursquare:<br>and the height thereof [shall be] three cubits.<br>
27:2 And thou shalt make the horns of it upon the four corners thereof:<br>his horns shall be of the same </b></i>{ie., of shittim wood}<i><b>: and thou shalt overlay it with brass.<br>
27:3 And thou shalt make his pans to receive his ashes,<br>and his shovels, and his basons, and his fleshhooks, and his firepans:<br>all the vessels thereof thou shalt make [of] brass.<br>
27:4 And thou shalt make for it a grate of network [of] brass;<br>and upon the net shalt thou make four brasen rings in the four corners thereof.<br>
27:5 And thou shalt put it under the compass of the altar beneath,<br>that the net may be even to the midst of the altar.<br>
27:6 And thou shalt make staves for the altar, staves [of] shittim wood, and overlay them with brass.<br>
27:7 And the staves shall be put into the rings,<br>and the staves shall be upon the two sides of the altar, to bear it.<br>
27:8 Hollow with boards shalt thou make it:<br>as it was shewed thee in the mount, so shall they make [it].</i></b></dt><dl>
<dt>The Brazen Altar of Sacrifice was...<ul>
<li>made of wood overlaid with brass.-<dd>The furniture of the Holy Places was overlaid with gold.</dd><dd>The furniture of the outer court was overlaid with brass.</dd><dd>Both speak of Christ (cp. <a href="rev1.htm#13">Rev 1:13,15</a>)...<ul><li>The acacia wood speaks of His human nature without corruption.<li>The gold speaks of His deity in glorious holiness.<li>The brass speaks of His deity in righteous judgment (cp. <a href="num21.htm#9">Num 21:9</a>; <a href="joh3.htm#14">Joh 3:14</a>; <a href="joh12.htm#31">12:31-33</a>).</ul></dd>
<li>located just inside the Gate.-<dd>A man's sin must be purged away, before he can have access to the holy God.
<ol type="a"><li>On the basis of good works or self-righteousness, no man can approach (<a href="isa64.htm#6">Isa 64:6</a>).<dd>The altar had no steps for self-improvement (<a href="ex20.htm#26">Ex 20:26</a>).<li>On the basis of the Law:<dd>All are condemned. <a href="rom3.htm#10">Rom 3:10-20</a></dd><dd>God's righteous judgment must be satisfied. <a href="eze18.htm#4">Ezek 18:4</a>; <a href="rom6.htm#23">6:23(a)</a></dd><dd>But no sinner can survive the payment of that penalty.</dd>
<li>On the basis of Grace:<dd>A substitute bears the sentence of death for the sinner,</dd><dd>to whom righteousness is imputed by faith. <a href="joh1.htm#29">Joh 1:29</a>; <a href="joh3.htm#14">3:14-18</a>; <a href="rom3.htm#21">Rom 3:21-26</a><ul><li>The blood, that made atonement at the Mercy-seat, must first be shed at the Brazen Altar.
<li>The &quot;horns&quot; of the Altar (<a href="ex27.htm#2" target="lwr_lt">v.2</a>) speak of the power of this salvation. cp. <a href="rom1.htm#16">Rom 1:16-18</a></ul></dd></ol></ul>
<dt>At the Brazen Altar we see at least two pictures of Christ.-<ol type="1">
<li>As the Sacrifice, by His Blood, He satisfied the judgment against sinful man. <a href="1pet1.htm#18">1Pet 1:18,19</a>
<li>As the Altar of Brass, He endured the heat of the wrath of God against sin. <a href="isa33.htm#14">Isa 33:14</a>; <a href="heb12.htm#2">Heb 12:2,29</a>; <a href="heb1.htm#3">1:3</a></ol></dl>
<dt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Court of the Tabernacle (<a href="ex27.htm#9" target="lwr_lt">v.9-19</a>) -
<dt><b><i>27:9 And thou shalt make the court of the tabernacle:<br>for the south side southward [there shall be] hangings for the court [of] fine twined linen<br>of an hundred cubits long for one side:<br>
27:10 And the twenty pillars thereof and their twenty sockets [shall be of] brass;<br>the hooks of the pillars and their fillets [shall be of] silver.<br>
27:11 And likewise for the north side in length<br>[there shall be] hangings of an hundred [cubits] long,<br>and his twenty pillars and their twenty sockets [of] brass;<br>the hooks of the pillars and their fillets [of] silver.<br>
27:12 And [for] the breadth of the court on the west side [shall be] hangings of fifty cubits:<br>their pillars ten, and their sockets ten.<br>
27:13 And the breadth of the court on the east side eastward [shall be] fifty cubits.<br>
27:14 The hangings of one side [of the gate shall be] fifteen cubits:<br>their pillars three, and their sockets three.<br>
27:15 And on the other side [shall be] hangings fifteen [cubits]:<br>their pillars three, and their sockets three.<br>
27:16 And for the gate of the court [shall be] an hanging of twenty cubits,<br>[of] blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen, wrought with needlework:<br>[and] their pillars [shall be] four, and their sockets four.<br>
27:17 All the pillars round about the court [shall be] filleted with silver;<br>their hooks [shall be of] silver, and their sockets [of] brass.<br>
27:18 The length of the court [shall be] an hundred cubits, and the breadth fifty every where,<br>and the height five cubits [of] fine twined linen, and their sockets [of] brass.<br>
27:19 All the vessels of the tabernacle in all the service thereof, and all the pins thereof,<br>and all the pins of the court, [shall be of] brass.</i></b></dt><dl>
<dt>The Court and its Gate -
<ul><li>It's design -<dd>The court surrounding the Tabernacle was separated from the outside world by a fence (fifteen feet high) made of curtains.</dd><dd>The curtains of the Gate, on the east end of the court, provided the only entrance.</dd>
<li>It's materials -<ul>
<li>Fine twined linen... brass pillars - These speak of God's righteousness and judgment.<br>
We cannot enter into His presence and live, because we cannot meet His righteous requirements. cp. <a href="luk10.htm#25">Luk 10:25-28</a>; <a href="rom7.htm#18">Rom 7:18,19</a>
<li>Silver clasps, and fillets {ornamentation on the pillar tops} hint that redemption is possible.<br>The sockets of silver on which the boards of the Tabernacle stand, spoke of our salvation (see the <a href="ex_menu.htm" target="lwr_lt">Book Notes</a> at Ex 26:15-30). Its price is not beyond the reach of any man, for it has been paid by Another (<a href="1pet1.htm#18">1Pet 1:18,19</a>).</dd></ul>
<li>The Gate -<ul>
<li>Its colors speak of Christ. It hung upon four pillars (corresponding to the four Gospels).<br>
- Blue - the Heavenly One, the Son of God (the theme of John's gospel).<br>
- Purple - the Royal One, the King of Israel (the theme of Matthew's gospel).<br>
- Scarlet - the Suffering One, the Man of Sorrows (the theme of Luke's gospel).<br>
- Fine Linen - the Righteous One, the Faithful Servant (the theme of Mark's gospel).
<li>Provided the one way of access.<br>All who would enter God's presence, must come by way of the Gate. <a href="joh10.htm#9">Joh 10:9</a>; <a href="joh14.htm#6">14:6</a><br>Whoever would enter here is immediately confronted with the Brazen Altar, where sin must be confessed and judged.</ul></ul></dl>
<dt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Oil for the Lamp (<a href="ex27.htm#20" target="lwr_lt">v.20-21</a>) -
<dt><b><i>27:20 And thou shalt command the children of Israel,<br>that they bring thee pure oil olive beaten for the light,<br>to cause the lamp to burn always.<br>
27:21 In the tabernacle of the congregation without the vail,<br>which [is] before the testimony </b></i>{ie., the Ark of the Covenant}<i><b>,<br>Aaron and his sons shall order it from evening to morning before the LORD:<br>[it shall be] a statute for ever unto their generations on the behalf of the children of Israel.</i></b></dt><dl>
<dt>pure olive oil <i>beaten</i> {or, crushed} for the light -
<dd>It is more than coincidental that this is mentioned in context with the Gate and the Altar of Sacrifice.<dd>It speaks of Gethsemane {lit., 'the olive press'} and of Jesus' agony as He  prepared to make the Way for us, through offering Himself on the cross. <a href="mat26.htm#36">Mat 26:36-42</a>; <a href="luk22.htm#42">Luke 22:42-44</a>; <a href="joh12.htm#27">Joh 12:27</a>; cp. <a href="joh14.htm#1">14:1-6</a>
