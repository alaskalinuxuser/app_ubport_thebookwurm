Psalms  10<br>1. Why standest thou afar off, O LORD? [why] hidest thou [thyself] in times of trouble?<br><a name="2">2</a>  The wicked in [his] pride doth persecute the poor: let them be taken in the devices that they have imagined.<br><a name="3">3</a>  For the wicked boasteth of his heart's desire, and blesseth the covetous, [whom] the LORD abhorreth.<br><a name="4">4</a>  The wicked, through the pride of his countenance, will not seek [after God]: God [is] not in all his thoughts.<br><a name="5">5</a>  His ways are always grievous; thy judgments [are] far above out of his sight: [as for] all his enemies, he puffeth at them.<br><a name="6">6</a>  He hath said in his heart, I shall not be moved: for [I shall] never [be] in adversity.<br><a name="7">7</a>  His mouth is full of cursing and deceit and fraud: under his tongue [is] mischief and vanity.<br><a name="8">8</a>  He sitteth in the lurking places of the villages: in the secret places doth he murder the innocent: his eyes are privily set against the poor.<br><a name="9">9</a>  He lieth in wait secretly as a lion in his den: he lieth in wait to catch the poor: he doth catch the poor, when he draweth him into his net.<br><a name="10">10</a>  He croucheth, [and] humbleth himself, that the poor may fall by his strong ones.<br><a name="11">11</a>  He hath said in his heart, God hath forgotten: he hideth his face; he will never see [it].<br><a name="12">12</a>. Arise, O LORD; O God, lift up thine hand: forget not the humble.<br><a name="13">13</a>  Wherefore doth the wicked contemn God? he hath said in his heart, Thou wilt not require [it].<br><a name="14">14</a>  Thou hast seen [it]; for thou beholdest mischief and spite, to requite [it] with thy hand: the poor committeth himself unto thee; thou art the helper of the fatherless.<br><a name="15">15</a>  Break thou the arm of the wicked and the evil [man]: seek out his wickedness [till] thou find none.<br><a name="16">16</a>  The LORD [is] King for ever and ever: the heathen are perished out of his land.<br><a name="17">17</a>  LORD, thou hast heard the desire of the humble: thou wilt prepare their heart, thou wilt cause thine ear to hear:<br><a name="18">18</a>  To judge the fatherless and the oppressed, that the man of the earth may no more oppress.<br><br>Go to <a href="psa11.htm#1">Psalm 11</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
