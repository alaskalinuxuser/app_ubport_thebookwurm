Proverbs  18<br>1. Through desire a man, having separated himself, seeketh [and] intermeddleth with all wisdom.<br><a name="2">2</a>. A fool hath no delight in understanding, but that his heart may discover itself.<br><a name="3">3</a>. When the wicked cometh, [then] cometh also contempt, and with ignominy reproach.<br><a name="4">4</a>. The words of a man's mouth [are as] deep waters, [and] the wellspring of wisdom [as] a flowing brook.<br><a name="5">5</a>. [It is] not good to accept the person of the wicked, to overthrow the righteous in judgment.<br><a name="6">6</a>. A fool's lips enter into contention, and his mouth calleth for strokes.<br><a name="7">7</a>  A fool's mouth [is] his destruction, and his lips [are] the snare of his soul.<br><a name="8">8</a>. The words of a talebearer [are] as wounds, and they go down into the innermost parts of the belly.<br><a name="9">9</a>. He also that is slothful in his work is brother to him that is a great waster.<br><a name="10">10</a>. The name of the LORD [is] a strong tower: the righteous runneth into it, and is safe.<br><a name="11">11</a>. The rich man's wealth [is] his strong city, and as an high wall in his own conceit.<br><a name="12">12</a>. Before destruction the heart of man is haughty, and before honour [is] humility.<br><a name="13">13</a>. He that answereth a matter before he heareth [it], it [is] folly and shame unto him.<br><a name="14">14</a>. The spirit of a man will sustain his infirmity; but a wounded spirit who can bear?<br><a name="15">15</a>. The heart of the prudent getteth knowledge; and the ear of the wise seeketh knowledge.<br><a name="16">16</a>. A man's gift maketh room for him, and bringeth him before great men.<br><a name="17">17</a>. [He that is] first in his own cause [seemeth] just; but his neighbour cometh and searcheth him.<br><a name="18">18</a>. The lot causeth contentions to cease, and parteth between the mighty.<br><a name="19">19</a>. A brother offended [is harder to be won] than a strong city: and [their] contentions [are] like the bars of a castle.<br><a name="20">20</a>. A man's belly shall be satisfied with the fruit of his mouth; [and] with the increase of his lips shall he be filled.<br><a name="21">21</a>. Death and life [are] in the power of the tongue: and they that love it shall eat the fruit thereof.<br><a name="22">22</a>. [Whoso] findeth a wife findeth a good [thing], and obtaineth favour of the LORD.<br><a name="23">23</a>. The poor useth intreaties; but the rich answereth roughly.<br><a name="24">24</a>. A man [that hath] friends must shew himself friendly: and there is a friend [that] sticketh closer than a brother.<br><br>Go to <a href="pro19.htm#1">Proverbs 19</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
