<b>Volume 2, Lesson 17</b><br>
by C.I. Scofield
<h2>Redemption in the Old Testament</h2></center>
<p>Redemption, to set free by paying a price, is one of the most beautiful aspects of the sacrificial death of Christ, and is both an Old Testament and New Testament doctrine.</p>
<b><ol type="A">
<li>The Kinsman-Redeemer</b><br>A kinsman-redeemer was a relative who restored or preserved the full rights of disadvantaged family members. The concept arises from God's covenant relationship with Israel and points to the redemption of humanity in Jesus Christ.<ul>
<li><a href="lev25.htm#25">Leviticus 25:25</a> - &quot;Any of his kin come to redeem it&quot;
<li><a href="lev25.htm#48">Leviticus 25:48</a> - &quot;One of his brethren may redeem him&quot;
<li><a href="ruth2.htm#20">Ruth 2:20</a> - &quot;The man is near of kin unto us&quot; 
<li><a href="gal4.htm#4">Galatians 4:4,5</a> - &quot;God sent forth His Son, made of a woman... to redeem them&quot;
<li><a href="heb2.htm#14">Hebrews 2:14,15</a> - &quot;He also Himself... took part of the same; that through death... He might... deliver them&quot;</ul><b>
<li>The Exodus of Israel</b><ol type="1">
<li>The source of redemption: God<ul>
<li><a href="ex3.htm#7">Exodus 3:7</a> - &quot;I have surely seen the affliction... have heard their cry&quot;
<li><a href="ex3.htm#8">Exodus 3:8</a> - &quot;And I am come down to deliver them&quot;
<li><a href="mat1.htm#21">Matthew 1:21</a> - &quot;Thou shalt call His name Jesus: for He shall save His people&quot;
<li><a href="joh6.htm#44">John 6:44</a> - &quot;No man can come to Me, except the Father... draw him&quot;</ul>
<li>The price of redemption: blood<ul>
<li><a href="1pet1.htm#18">1Peter 1:18,19</a> - &quot;Redeemed... with the precious blood&quot; 
<li><a href="ex12.htm#13">Exodus 12:13</a> - &quot;When I see the blood&quot;</ul>
<li>The deliverence of redemption: power<ul>
<li><a href="ex6.htm#6">Exodus 6:6</a> - &quot;I will redeem you with a stretched out arm&quot;
<li><a href="ex13.htm#14">Exodus 13:14</a> - &quot;By strength of hand the Lord brought us out&quot;
<li><a href="deu7.htm#8">Deuteronomy 7:8</a> - &quot;Brought you out... and redeemed you&quot;
<li><a href="rom8.htm#2">Romans 8:2</a> - &quot;Law of the Spirit... hath made me free&quot;
<li><a href="rom1.htm#16">Romans 1:16</a> - &quot;I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ: for it is the power of God unto salvation&quot;</ul></ol>
In the New Testament fulfillment of the Old Testament pictures, the Father draws the sinner to Himself, the blood of Christ pays the redemption price, and the power of the Spirit sets the believer free.</ol>
