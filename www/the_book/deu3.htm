Deuteronomy   3<br>1. Then we turned, and went up the way to Bashan: and Og the king of Bashan came out against us, he and all his people, to battle at Edrei.<br><a name="2">2</a>  And the LORD said unto me, Fear him not: for I will deliver him, and all his people, and his land, into thy hand; and thou shalt do unto him as thou didst unto Sihon king of the Amorites, which dwelt at Heshbon.<br><a name="3">3</a>  So the LORD our God delivered into our hands Og also, the king of Bashan, and all his people: and we smote him until none was left to him remaining.<br><a name="4">4</a>  And we took all his cities at that time, there was not a city which we took not from them, threescore cities, all the region of Argob, the kingdom of Og in Bashan.<br><a name="5">5</a>  All these cities [were] fenced with high walls, gates, and bars; beside unwalled towns a great many.<br><a name="6">6</a>  And we utterly destroyed them, as we did unto Sihon king of Heshbon, utterly destroying the men, women, and children, of every city.<br><a name="7">7</a>  But all the cattle, and the spoil of the cities, we took for a prey to ourselves.<br><a name="8">8</a>  And we took at that time out of the hand of the two kings of the Amorites the land that [was] on this side Jordan, from the river of Arnon unto mount Hermon;<br><a name="9">9</a>  ([Which] Hermon the Sidonians call Sirion; and the Amorites call it Shenir;)<br><a name="10">10</a>  All the cities of the plain, and all Gilead, and all Bashan, unto Salchah and Edrei, cities of the kingdom of Og in Bashan.<br><a name="11">11</a>  For only Og king of Bashan remained of the remnant of giants; behold, his bedstead [was] a bedstead of iron; [is] it not in Rabbath of the children of Ammon? nine cubits [was] the length thereof, and four cubits the breadth of it, after the cubit of a man.<br><a name="12">12</a>. And this land, [which] we possessed at that time, from Aroer, which [is] by the river Arnon, and half mount Gilead, and the cities thereof, gave I unto the Reubenites and to the Gadites.<br><a name="13">13</a>  And the rest of Gilead, and all Bashan, [being] the kingdom of Og, gave I unto the half tribe of Manasseh; all the region of Argob, with all Bashan, which was called the land of giants.<br><a name="14">14</a>  Jair the son of Manasseh took all the country of Argob unto the coasts of Geshuri and Maachathi; and called them after his own name, Bashanhavothjair, unto this day.<br><a name="15">15</a>  And I gave Gilead unto Machir.<br><a name="16">16</a>  And unto the Reubenites and unto the Gadites I gave from Gilead even unto the river Arnon half the valley, and the border even unto the river Jabbok, [which is] the border of the children of Ammon;<br><a name="17">17</a>  The plain also, and Jordan, and the coast [thereof], from Chinnereth even unto the sea of the plain, [even] the salt sea, under Ashdothpisgah eastward.<br><a name="18">18</a>  And I commanded you at that time, saying, The LORD your God hath given you this land to possess it: ye shall pass over armed before your brethren the children of Israel, all [that are] meet for the war.<br><a name="19">19</a>  But your wives, and your little ones, and your cattle, ([for] I know that ye have much cattle,) shall abide in your cities which I have given you;<br><a name="20">20</a>  Until the LORD have given rest unto your brethren, as well as unto you, and [until] they also possess the land which the LORD your God hath given them beyond Jordan: and [then] shall ye return every man unto his possession, which I have given you.<br><a name="21">21</a>. And I commanded Joshua at that time, saying, Thine eyes have seen all that the LORD your God hath done unto these two kings: so shall the LORD do unto all the kingdoms whither thou passest.<br><a name="22">22</a>  Ye shall not fear them: for the LORD your God he shall fight for you.<br><a name="23">23</a>  And I besought the LORD at that time, saying,<br><a name="24">24</a>  O Lord GOD, thou hast begun to shew thy servant thy greatness, and thy mighty hand: for what God [is there] in heaven or in earth, that can do according to thy works, and according to thy might?<br><a name="25">25</a>  I pray thee, let me go over, and see the good land that [is] beyond Jordan, that goodly mountain, and Lebanon.<br><a name="26">26</a>  But the LORD was wroth with me for your sakes, and would not hear me: and the LORD said unto me, Let it suffice thee; speak no more unto me of this matter.<br><a name="27">27</a>  Get thee up into the top of Pisgah, and lift up thine eyes westward, and northward, and southward, and eastward, and behold [it] with thine eyes: for thou shalt not go over this Jordan.<br><a name="28">28</a>  But charge Joshua, and encourage him, and strengthen him: for he shall go over before this people, and he shall cause them to inherit the land which thou shalt see.<br><a name="29">29</a>  So we abode in the valley over against Bethpeor.<br><br>Go to <a href="deu4.htm#1">Deuteronomy 4</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
