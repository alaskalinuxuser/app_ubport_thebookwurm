1John   4<br>1. Beloved, believe not every spirit, but try the spirits whether they are of God: because many false prophets are gone out into the world.<br><a name="2">2</a>  Hereby know ye the Spirit of God: Every spirit that confesseth that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is of God:<br><a name="3">3</a>  And every spirit that confesseth not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is not of God: and this is that [spirit] of antichrist, whereof ye have heard that it should come; and even now already is it in the world.<br><a name="4">4</a>. Ye are of God, little children, and have overcome them: because greater is he that is in you, than he that is in the world.<br><a name="5">5</a>  They are of the world: therefore speak they of the world, and the world heareth them.<br><a name="6">6</a>  We are of God: he that knoweth God heareth us; he that is not of God heareth not us. Hereby know we the spirit of truth, and the spirit of error.<br><a name="7">7</a>. Beloved, let us love one another: for love is of God; and every one that loveth is born of God, and knoweth God.<br><a name="8">8</a>  He that loveth not knoweth not God; for God is love.<br><a name="9">9</a>  In this was manifested the love of God toward us, because that God sent his only begotten Son into the world, that we might live through him.<br><a name="10">10</a>  Herein is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and sent his Son [to be] the propitiation for our sins.<br><a name="11">11</a>  Beloved, if God so loved us, we ought also to love one another.<br><a name="12">12</a>  No man hath seen God at any time. If we love one another, God dwelleth in us, and his love is perfected in us.<br><a name="13">13</a>  Hereby know we that we dwell in him, and he in us, because he hath given us of his Spirit.<br><a name="14">14</a>. And we have seen and do testify that the Father sent the Son [to be] the Saviour of the world.<br><a name="15">15</a>  Whosoever shall confess that Jesus is the Son of God, God dwelleth in him, and he in God.<br><a name="16">16</a>  And we have known and believed the love that God hath to us. God is love; and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in God, and God in him.<br><a name="17">17</a>. Herein is our love made perfect, that we may have boldness in the day of judgment: because as he is, so are we in this world.<br><a name="18">18</a>  There is no fear in love; but perfect love casteth out fear: because fear hath torment. He that feareth is not made perfect in love.<br><a name="19">19</a>  We love him, because he first loved us.<br><a name="20">20</a>  If a man say, I love God, and hateth his brother, he is a liar: for he that loveth not his brother whom he hath seen, how can he love God whom he hath not seen?<br><a name="21">21</a>  And this commandment have we from him, That he who loveth God love his brother also.<br><br>Go to <a href="1joh5.htm#1">I John 5</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
