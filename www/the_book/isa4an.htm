<b><a href="isa4.htm#1" target="lwr_lt">Isaiah 4</a> - <a href="isa_menu.htm" target="lwr_lt">Outline of Isaiah </b>(MENU page)</a><br>
<dl><dt>This chapter continues the message begun in ch. 2.<dd>&nbsp;
<dt><b><i>1. And in that day seven women shall take hold of one man, saying,<br>We will eat our own bread, and wear our own apparel:<br>only let us be called by thy name, to take away our reproach.</i></b></dt><dl>
<dt>in that day- Verse 1 concludes a section of Isaiah's message which deals with sin and judgment.<dd>In this section of the message, &quot;in that day&quot; refers to the day of judgment (ie., during the Tribulation, as foreshadowed by the Babylonian captivity). cp. <a href="isa2.htm#11">Isa 2:11,17,20</a>; <a href="isa3.htm#7">3:7,18</a>
<dt>seven women shall take hold of one man...- These are women in desperation,<dd>due to the destruction of their nation, and their loss of everything, including their husbands. cp. <a href="isa3.htm#25">3:25,26</a>
<dt>we will eat our own bread... take away our reproach.- The man to whom they cling<dd>is himself in a desperate situation. He can hardly support one wife, let alone several (though in ordinary circumstances, it would be his responsibility, <a href="ex21.htm#10">Ex 21:10</a>). So, this verse emphasizes the message of <a href="isa2.htm#22">2:22</a>-- It is much better to trust in God than in man.</dl><br>
<a name="branch"></a><dt>I.A.2.<b>c. The Branch in His future Kingdom </b>(4:2-6)
<dt><b><i>2 In that day shall the branch of the LORD be beautiful and glorious,<br>and the fruit of the earth [shall be] excellent and comely for them that are escaped of Israel.<br>
3 And it shall come to pass, [that he that is] left in Zion, and [he that] remaineth in Jerusalem,<br>shall be called holy, [even] every one that is written among the living in Jerusalem:<br>
4 When the Lord shall have washed away the filth of the daughters of Zion,<br>and shall have purged the blood of Jerusalem from the midst thereof<br>by the spirit of judgment, and by the spirit of burning.<br>
5 And the LORD will create upon every dwelling place of mount Zion, and upon her assemblies,<br>a cloud and smoke by day, and the shining of a flaming fire by night:<br>for upon all the glory [shall be] a defence.<br>
6 And there shall be a tabernacle for a shadow in the daytime from the heat,<br>and for a place of refuge, and for a covert from storm and from rain.</i></b></dt><dl>
<dt>in that day - ie., &quot;The Day of the Lord&quot; which includes<dd>the judgments of the great Tribulation period, followed by, the establishment of the Messiah's Kingdom, when He will reign over all the earth from Jerusalem, for a thousand years. <a href="mat25.htm#31">Mat 25:31</a>; <a href="rev20.htm#4">Rev 20:4</a>
<dt>the Branch - this name for the Messiah is used in several ways [adapted from ScofRB]:<ol type="1">
<li>The Branch of Jehovah - He is Immanuel, &quot;God with us&quot; <a href="isa7.htm#14">Isa 7:14</a>; <a href="mat25.htm#31">Mat 25:31</a> (seen in His glory, at His second coming)
<li>The Branch of David - ie., &quot;of the seed of David according to the flesh&quot; (<a href="rom1.htm#3">Rom 1:3</a>; <a href="isa11.htm#1">Isa 11:1</a>), the King who will reign on David's throne (<a href="jer23.htm#5">Jer 23:5</a>; <a href="jer33.htm#15">33:15</a>).
<li>Jehovah's &quot;Servant, the Branch&quot; (<a href="zech3.htm#8">Zech 3:8</a>) who will fulfill His purposes.
<li>The &quot;man whose name is the Branch&quot; (<a href="zech6.htm#12">Zech 6:12,13</a>). As Son of man, He is the &quot;last Adam&quot; who restores what Adam lost through sin (cp. <a href="1cor15.htm#45">1Cor 15:45-47</a>). Here is the one Man in whom you may safely trust. In contrast to the man of <a href="isa4.htm#1" target="lwr_lt">v.1</a>, the love, power, wealth and sufficiency of this Man is revealed in <a href="isa4.htm#4" target="lwr_lt">v.4-6</a>.</ol>
<dt>he that is escaped... he that remaineth... among the living in Jerusalem...-
<dd>During the Tribulation, the world's population will be decimated due to devastating catastrophes. Likewise, a large percentage of Israel's population will not survive (<a href="zech13.htm#8">Zech 13:8,9</a>; <a href="zech14.htm#1">14:1-3</a>). Those who are still alive, when Christ establishes His Kingdom, will enter into the blessings of His reign of righteousness.
<dt>when the LORD... shall have purged the blood of Jerusalem...-<dd>This city is guilty of the blood of prophets, righteous men, and especially of the blood of her Messiah.<dd>But the city and her people will be cleansed of all sin (<a href="zech13.htm#1">Zech 13:1</a>).
<dt>upon every dwelling place... a cloud... and the shining... the glory...-<dd>The glory of the LORD's presence, which rested on the Tabernacle in the wilderness (<a href="ex13.htm#21">Ex 13:21,22</a>; <a href="ex40.htm#34">40:34,35</a>), will rest on every home in His Kingdom, for all will be holy unto the Lord.
<dt>upon all the glory shall be a defence {HB=chuppah, canopy, chamber, divine protection}-<dd>or, 'the glory over all shall be a bridal canopy.' cp. 'chuppah' in <a href="psa19.htm#5">Psa 19:5</a> (chamber), <a href="joel2.htm#16">Joel 2:16</a> (closet).<dd>The Branch is the Bridegroom (<a href="isa61.htm#10">Isa 61:10,11</a>; <a href="isa62.htm#4">62:4,5</a>; cp. <a href="joh3.htm#29">Joh 3:29-36</a>).<dd>He is the Man on whom we all need to take hold, for He alone can take away the reproach of our sinful condition (cp. <a href="isa4.htm#1" target="lwr_lt">v.1</a>).</dl></dl>
