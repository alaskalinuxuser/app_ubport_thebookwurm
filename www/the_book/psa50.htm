Psalms  50<br> 1. A Psalm of Asaph. The mighty God, [even] the LORD, hath spoken, and called the earth from the rising of the sun unto the going down thereof.<br><a name="2">2</a>  Out of Zion, the perfection of beauty, God hath shined.<br><a name="3">3</a>  Our God shall come, and shall not keep silence: a fire shall devour before him, and it shall be very tempestuous round about him.<br><a name="4">4</a>  He shall call to the heavens from above, and to the earth, that he may judge his people.<br><a name="5">5</a>  Gather my saints together unto me; those that have made a covenant with me by sacrifice.<br><a name="6">6</a>  And the heavens shall declare his righteousness: for God [is] judge himself. Selah.<br><a name="7">7</a>. Hear, O my people, and I will speak; O Israel, and I will testify against thee: I [am] God, [even] thy God.<br><a name="8">8</a>  I will not reprove thee for thy sacrifices or thy burnt offerings, [to have been] continually before me.<br><a name="9">9</a>  I will take no bullock out of thy house, [nor] he goats out of thy folds.<br><a name="10">10</a>  For every beast of the forest [is] mine, [and] the cattle upon a thousand hills.<br><a name="11">11</a>  I know all the fowls of the mountains: and the wild beasts of the field [are] mine.<br><a name="12">12</a>  If I were hungry, I would not tell thee: for the world [is] mine, and the fulness thereof.<br><a name="13">13</a>  Will I eat the flesh of bulls, or drink the blood of goats?<br><a name="14">14</a>  Offer unto God thanksgiving; and pay thy vows unto the most High:<br><a name="15">15</a>  And call upon me in the day of trouble: I will deliver thee, and thou shalt glorify me.<br><a name="16">16</a>. But unto the wicked God saith, What hast thou to do to declare my statutes, or [that] thou shouldest take my covenant in thy mouth?<br><a name="17">17</a>  Seeing thou hatest instruction, and castest my words behind thee.<br><a name="18">18</a>  When thou sawest a thief, then thou consentedst with him, and hast been partaker with adulterers.<br><a name="19">19</a>  Thou givest thy mouth to evil, and thy tongue frameth deceit.<br><a name="20">20</a>  Thou sittest [and] speakest against thy brother; thou slanderest thine own mother's son.<br><a name="21">21</a>  These [things] hast thou done, and I kept silence; thou thoughtest that I was altogether [such an one] as thyself: [but] I will reprove thee, and set [them] in order before thine eyes.<br><a name="22">22</a>  Now consider this, ye that forget God, lest I tear [you] in pieces, and [there be] none to deliver.<br><a name="23">23</a>  Whoso offereth praise glorifieth me: and to him that ordereth [his] conversation [aright] will I shew the salvation of God.<br><br>Go to <a href="psa51.htm#1">Psalm 51</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
