Psalms  22<br> 1. To the chief Musician upon Aijeleth Shahar, A Psalm of David. My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me? [why art thou so] far from helping me, [and from] the words of my roaring?<br><a name="2">2</a>  O my God, I cry in the daytime, but thou hearest not; and in the night season, and am not silent.<br><a name="3">3</a>  But thou [art] holy, [O thou] that inhabitest the praises of Israel.<br><a name="4">4</a>  Our fathers trusted in thee: they trusted, and thou didst deliver them.<br><a name="5">5</a>  They cried unto thee, and were delivered: they trusted in thee, and were not confounded.<br><a name="6">6</a>  But I [am] a worm, and no man; a reproach of men, and despised of the people.<br><a name="7">7</a>  All they that see me laugh me to scorn: they shoot out the lip, they shake the head, [saying],<br><a name="8">8</a>  He trusted on the LORD [that] he would deliver him: let him deliver him, seeing he delighted in him.<br><a name="9">9</a>  But thou [art] he that took me out of the womb: thou didst make me hope [when I was] upon my mother's breasts.<br><a name="10">10</a>  I was cast upon thee from the womb: thou [art] my God from my mother's belly.<br><a name="11">11</a>. Be not far from me; for trouble [is] near; for [there is] none to help.<br><a name="12">12</a>  Many bulls have compassed me: strong [bulls] of Bashan have beset me round.<br><a name="13">13</a>  They gaped upon me [with] their mouths, [as] a ravening and a roaring lion.<br><a name="14">14</a>  I am poured out like water, and all my bones are out of joint: my heart is like wax; it is melted in the midst of my bowels.<br><a name="15">15</a>  My strength is dried up like a potsherd; and my tongue cleaveth to my jaws; and thou hast brought me into the dust of death.<br><a name="16">16</a>  For dogs have compassed me: the assembly of the wicked have inclosed me: they pierced my hands and my feet.<br><a name="17">17</a>  I may tell all my bones: they look [and] stare upon me.<br><a name="18">18</a>  They part my garments among them, and cast lots upon my vesture.<br><a name="19">19</a>  But be not thou far from me, O LORD: O my strength, haste thee to help me.<br><a name="20">20</a>  Deliver my soul from the sword; my darling from the power of the dog.<br><a name="21">21</a>  Save me from the lion's mouth: for thou hast heard me from the horns of the unicorns.<br><a name="22">22</a>. I will declare thy name unto my brethren: in the midst of the congregation will I praise thee.<br><a name="23">23</a>  Ye that fear the LORD, praise him; all ye the seed of Jacob, glorify him; and fear him, all ye the seed of Israel.<br><a name="24">24</a>  For he hath not despised nor abhorred the affliction of the afflicted; neither hath he hid his face from him; but when he cried unto him, he heard.<br><a name="25">25</a>  My praise [shall be] of thee in the great congregation: I will pay my vows before them that fear him.<br><a name="26">26</a>  The meek shall eat and be satisfied: they shall praise the LORD that seek him: your heart shall live for ever.<br><a name="27">27</a>  All the ends of the world shall remember and turn unto the LORD: and all the kindreds of the nations shall worship before thee.<br><a name="28">28</a>  For the kingdom [is] the LORD'S: and he [is] the governor among the nations.<br><a name="29">29</a>  All [they that be] fat upon earth shall eat and worship: all they that go down to the dust shall bow before him: and none can keep alive his own soul.<br><a name="30">30</a>  A seed shall serve him; it shall be accounted to the Lord for a generation.<br><a name="31">31</a>  They shall come, and shall declare his righteousness unto a people that shall be born, that he hath done [this].<br><br>Go to <a href="psa23.htm#1">Psalm 23</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
