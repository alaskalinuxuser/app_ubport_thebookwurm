Proverbs  20<br> 1. Wine [is] a mocker, strong drink [is] raging: and whosoever is deceived thereby is not wise.<br><a name="2">2</a>. The fear of a king [is] as the roaring of a lion: [whoso] provoketh him to anger sinneth [against] his own soul.<br><a name="3">3</a>. [It is] an honour for a man to cease from strife: but every fool will be meddling.<br><a name="4">4</a>. The sluggard will not plow by reason of the cold; [therefore] shall he beg in harvest, and [have] nothing.<br><a name="5">5</a>. Counsel in the heart of man [is like] deep water; but a man of understanding will draw it out.<br><a name="6">6</a>. Most men will proclaim every one his own goodness: but a faithful man who can find?<br><a name="7">7</a>. The just [man] walketh in his integrity: his children [are] blessed after him.<br><a name="8">8</a>. A king that sitteth in the throne of judgment scattereth away all evil with his eyes.<br><a name="9">9</a>. Who can say, I have made my heart clean, I am pure from my sin?<br><a name="10">10</a>. Divers weights, [and] divers measures, both of them [are] alike abomination to the LORD.<br><a name="11">11</a>. Even a child is known by his doings, whether his work [be] pure, and whether [it be] right.<br><a name="12">12</a>. The hearing ear, and the seeing eye, the LORD hath made even both of them.<br><a name="13">13</a>. Love not sleep, lest thou come to poverty; open thine eyes, [and] thou shalt be satisfied with bread.<br><a name="14">14</a>. [It is] naught, [it is] naught, saith the buyer: but when he is gone his way, then he boasteth.<br><a name="15">15</a>. There is gold, and a multitude of rubies: but the lips of knowledge [are] a precious jewel.<br><a name="16">16</a>. Take his garment that is surety [for] a stranger: and take a pledge of him for a strange woman.<br><a name="17">17</a>. Bread of deceit [is] sweet to a man; but afterwards his mouth shall be filled with gravel.<br><a name="18">18</a>. [Every] purpose is established by counsel: and with good advice make war.<br><a name="19">19</a>. He that goeth about [as] a talebearer revealeth secrets: therefore meddle not with him that flattereth with his lips.<br><a name="20">20</a>. Whoso curseth his father or his mother, his lamp shall be put out in obscure darkness.<br><a name="21">21</a>. An inheritance [may be] gotten hastily at the beginning; but the end thereof shall not be blessed.<br><a name="22">22</a>. Say not thou, I will recompense evil; [but] wait on the LORD, and he shall save thee.<br><a name="23">23</a>. Divers weights [are] an abomination unto the LORD; and a false balance [is] not good.<br><a name="24">24</a>. Man's goings [are] of the LORD; how can a man then understand his own way?<br><a name="25">25</a>. [It is] a snare to the man [who] devoureth [that which is] holy, and after vows to make enquiry.<br><a name="26">26</a>. A wise king scattereth the wicked, and bringeth the wheel over them.<br><a name="27">27</a>. The spirit of man [is] the candle of the LORD, searching all the inward parts of the belly.<br><a name="28">28</a>. Mercy and truth preserve the king: and his throne is upholden by mercy.<br><a name="29">29</a>. The glory of young men [is] their strength: and the beauty of old men [is] the gray head.<br><a name="30">30</a>. The blueness of a wound cleanseth away evil: so [do] stripes the inward parts of the belly.<br><br>Go to <a href="pro21.htm#1">Proverbs 21</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
