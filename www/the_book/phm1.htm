Philemon   1<br>1. Paul, a prisoner of Jesus Christ, and Timothy [our] brother, unto Philemon our dearly beloved, and fellowlabourer,<br><a name="2">2</a>  And to [our] beloved Apphia, and Archippus our fellowsoldier, and to the church in thy house:<br><a name="3">3</a>  Grace to you, and peace, from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.<br><a name="4">4</a>  I thank my God, making mention of thee always in my prayers,<br><a name="5">5</a>  Hearing of thy love and faith, which thou hast toward the Lord Jesus, and toward all saints;<br><a name="6">6</a>  That the communication of thy faith may become effectual by the acknowledging of every good thing which is in you in Christ Jesus.<br><a name="7">7</a>  For we have great joy and consolation in thy love, because the bowels of the saints are refreshed by thee, brother.<br><a name="8">8</a>. Wherefore, though I might be much bold in Christ to enjoin thee that which is convenient,<br><a name="9">9</a>  Yet for love's sake I rather beseech [thee], being such an one as Paul the aged, and now also a prisoner of Jesus Christ.<br><a name="10">10</a>  I beseech thee for my son Onesimus, whom I have begotten in my bonds:<br><a name="11">11</a>  Which in time past was to thee unprofitable, but now profitable to thee and to me:<br><a name="12">12</a>  Whom I have sent again: thou therefore receive him, that is, mine own bowels:<br><a name="13">13</a>  Whom I would have retained with me, that in thy stead he might have ministered unto me in the bonds of the gospel:<br><a name="14">14</a>  But without thy mind would I do nothing; that thy benefit should not be as it were of necessity, but willingly.<br><a name="15">15</a>  For perhaps he therefore departed for a season, that thou shouldest receive him for ever;<br><a name="16">16</a>  Not now as a servant, but above a servant, a brother beloved, specially to me, but how much more unto thee, both in the flesh, and in the Lord?<br><a name="17">17</a>  If thou count me therefore a partner, receive him as myself.<br><a name="18">18</a>  If he hath wronged thee, or oweth [thee] ought, put that on mine account;<br><a name="19">19</a>  I Paul have written [it] with mine own hand, I will repay [it]: albeit I do not say to thee how thou owest unto me even thine own self besides.<br><a name="20">20</a>  Yea, brother, let me have joy of thee in the Lord: refresh my bowels in the Lord.<br><a name="21">21</a>  Having confidence in thy obedience I wrote unto thee, knowing that thou wilt also do more than I say.<br><a name="22">22</a>  But withal prepare me also a lodging: for I trust that through your prayers I shall be given unto you.<br><a name="23">23</a>  There salute thee Epaphras, my fellowprisoner in Christ Jesus;<br><a name="24">24</a>  Marcus, Aristarchus, Demas, Lucas, my fellowlabourers.<br><a name="25">25</a>  The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ [be] with your spirit.
