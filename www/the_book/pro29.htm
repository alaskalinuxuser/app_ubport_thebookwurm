Proverbs  29<br>1. He, that being often reproved hardeneth [his] neck, shall suddenly be destroyed, and that without remedy.<br><a name="2">2</a>. When the righteous are in authority, the people rejoice: but when the wicked beareth rule, the people mourn.<br><a name="3">3</a>. Whoso loveth wisdom rejoiceth his father: but he that keepeth company with harlots spendeth [his] substance.<br><a name="4">4</a>. The king by judgment establisheth the land: but he that receiveth gifts overthroweth it.<br><a name="5">5</a>. A man that flattereth his neighbour spreadeth a net for his feet.<br><a name="6">6</a>. In the transgression of an evil man [there is] a snare: but the righteous doth sing and rejoice.<br><a name="7">7</a>. The righteous considereth the cause of the poor: [but] the wicked regardeth not to know [it].<br><a name="8">8</a>. Scornful men bring a city into a snare: but wise [men] turn away wrath.<br><a name="9">9</a>. [If] a wise man contendeth with a foolish man, whether he rage or laugh, [there is] no rest.<br><a name="10">10</a>. The bloodthirsty hate the upright: but the just seek his soul.<br><a name="11">11</a>. A fool uttereth all his mind: but a wise [man] keepeth it in till afterwards.<br><a name="12">12</a>. If a ruler hearken to lies, all his servants [are] wicked.<br><a name="13">13</a>. The poor and the deceitful man meet together: the LORD lighteneth both their eyes.<br><a name="14">14</a>. The king that faithfully judgeth the poor, his throne shall be established for ever.<br><a name="15">15</a>. The rod and reproof give wisdom: but a child left [to himself] bringeth his mother to shame.<br><a name="16">16</a>. When the wicked are multiplied, transgression increaseth: but the righteous shall see their fall.<br><a name="17">17</a>. Correct thy son, and he shall give thee rest; yea, he shall give delight unto thy soul.<br><a name="18">18</a>. Where [there is] no vision, the people perish: but he that keepeth the law, happy [is] he.<br><a name="19">19</a>. A servant will not be corrected by words: for though he understand he will not answer.<br><a name="20">20</a>. Seest thou a man [that is] hasty in his words? [there is] more hope of a fool than of him.<br><a name="21">21</a>. He that delicately bringeth up his servant from a child shall have him become [his] son at the length.<br><a name="22">22</a>. An angry man stirreth up strife, and a furious man aboundeth in transgression.<br><a name="23">23</a>. A man's pride shall bring him low: but honour shall uphold the humble in spirit.<br><a name="24">24</a>. Whoso is partner with a thief hateth his own soul: he heareth cursing, and bewrayeth [it] not.<br><a name="25">25</a>. The fear of man bringeth a snare: but whoso putteth his trust in the LORD shall be safe.<br><a name="26">26</a>. Many seek the ruler's favour; but [every] man's judgment [cometh] from the LORD.<br><a name="27">27</a>. An unjust man [is] an abomination to the just: and [he that is] upright in the way [is] abomination to the wicked.<br><br>Go to <a href="pro30.htm#1">Proverbs 30</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
