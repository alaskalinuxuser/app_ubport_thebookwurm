Exodus  11<br> 1. And the LORD said unto Moses, Yet will I bring one plague [more] upon Pharaoh, and upon Egypt; afterwards he will let you go hence: when he shall let [you] go, he shall surely thrust you out hence altogether.<br><a name="2">2</a>  Speak now in the ears of the people, and let every man borrow of his neighbour, and every woman of her neighbour, jewels of silver, and jewels of gold.<br><a name="3">3</a>  And the LORD gave the people favour in the sight of the Egyptians. Moreover the man Moses [was] very great in the land of Egypt, in the sight of Pharaoh's servants, and in the sight of the people.<br><a name="4">4</a>. And Moses said, Thus saith the LORD, About midnight will I go out into the midst of Egypt:<br><a name="5">5</a>  And all the firstborn in the land of Egypt shall die, from the firstborn of Pharaoh that sitteth upon his throne, even unto the firstborn of the maidservant that [is] behind the mill; and all the firstborn of beasts.<br><a name="6">6</a>  And there shall be a great cry throughout all the land of Egypt, such as there was none like it, nor shall be like it any more.<br><a name="7">7</a>  But against any of the children of Israel shall not a dog move his tongue, against man or beast: that ye may know how that the LORD doth put a difference between the Egyptians and Israel.<br><a name="8">8</a>  And all these thy servants shall come down unto me, and bow down themselves unto me, saying, Get thee out, and all the people that follow thee: and after that I will go out. And he went out from Pharaoh in a great anger.<br><a name="9">9</a>  And the LORD said unto Moses, Pharaoh shall not hearken unto you; that my wonders may be multiplied in the land of Egypt.<br><a name="10">10</a>  And Moses and Aaron did all these wonders before Pharaoh: and the LORD hardened Pharaoh's heart, so that he would not let the children of Israel go out of his land.<br><br>Go to <a href="ex12.htm#1">Exodus 12</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
