Psalms  31<br> 1. To the chief Musician, A Psalm of David. In thee, O LORD, do I put my trust; let me never be ashamed: deliver me in thy righteousness.<br><a name="2">2</a>  Bow down thine ear to me; deliver me speedily: be thou my strong rock, for an house of defence to save me.<br><a name="3">3</a>  For thou [art] my rock and my fortress; therefore for thy name's sake lead me, and guide me.<br><a name="4">4</a>  Pull me out of the net that they have laid privily for me: for thou [art] my strength.<br><a name="5">5</a>  Into thine hand I commit my spirit: thou hast redeemed me, O LORD God of truth.<br><a name="6">6</a>  I have hated them that regard lying vanities: but I trust in the LORD.<br><a name="7">7</a>  I will be glad and rejoice in thy mercy: for thou hast considered my trouble; thou hast known my soul in adversities;<br><a name="8">8</a>  And hast not shut me up into the hand of the enemy: thou hast set my feet in a large room.<br><a name="9">9</a>. Have mercy upon me, O LORD, for I am in trouble: mine eye is consumed with grief, [yea], my soul and my belly.<br><a name="10">10</a>  For my life is spent with grief, and my years with sighing: my strength faileth because of mine iniquity, and my bones are consumed.<br><a name="11">11</a>  I was a reproach among all mine enemies, but especially among my neighbours, and a fear to mine acquaintance: they that did see me without fled from me.<br><a name="12">12</a>  I am forgotten as a dead man out of mind: I am like a broken vessel.<br><a name="13">13</a>  For I have heard the slander of many: fear [was] on every side: while they took counsel together against me, they devised to take away my life.<br><a name="14">14</a>  But I trusted in thee, O LORD: I said, Thou [art] my God.<br><a name="15">15</a>  My times [are] in thy hand: deliver me from the hand of mine enemies, and from them that persecute me.<br><a name="16">16</a>  Make thy face to shine upon thy servant: save me for thy mercies' sake.<br><a name="17">17</a>  Let me not be ashamed, O LORD; for I have called upon thee: let the wicked be ashamed, [and] let them be silent in the grave.<br><a name="18">18</a>  Let the lying lips be put to silence; which speak grievous things proudly and contemptuously against the righteous.<br><a name="19">19</a>. [Oh] how great [is] thy goodness, which thou hast laid up for them that fear thee; [which] thou hast wrought for them that trust in thee before the sons of men!<br><a name="20">20</a>  Thou shalt hide them in the secret of thy presence from the pride of man: thou shalt keep them secretly in a pavilion from the strife of tongues.<br><a name="21">21</a>  Blessed [be] the LORD: for he hath shewed me his marvellous kindness in a strong city.<br><a name="22">22</a>  For I said in my haste, I am cut off from before thine eyes: nevertheless thou heardest the voice of my supplications when I cried unto thee.<br><a name="23">23</a>  O love the LORD, all ye his saints: [for] the LORD preserveth the faithful, and plentifully rewardeth the proud doer.<br><a name="24">24</a>  Be of good courage, and he shall strengthen your heart, all ye that hope in the LORD.<br><br>Go to <a href="psa32.htm#1">Psalm 32</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
