Ecclesiastes   1<br>1. The words of the Preacher, the son of David, king in Jerusalem.<br><a name="2">2</a>  Vanity of vanities, saith the Preacher, vanity of vanities; all [is] vanity.<br><a name="3">3</a>  What profit hath a man of all his labour which he taketh under the sun?<br><a name="4">4</a>. [One] generation passeth away, and [another] generation cometh: but the earth abideth for ever.<br><a name="5">5</a>  The sun also ariseth, and the sun goeth down, and hasteth to his place where he arose.<br><a name="6">6</a>  The wind goeth toward the south, and turneth about unto the north; it whirleth about continually, and the wind returneth again according to his circuits.<br><a name="7">7</a>  All the rivers run into the sea; yet the sea [is] not full; unto the place from whence the rivers come, thither they return again.<br><a name="8">8</a>  All things [are] full of labour; man cannot utter [it]: the eye is not satisfied with seeing, nor the ear filled with hearing.<br><a name="9">9</a>. The thing that hath been, it [is that] which shall be; and that which is done [is] that which shall be done: and [there is] no new [thing] under the sun.<br><a name="10">10</a>  Is there [any] thing whereof it may be said, See, this [is] new? it hath been already of old time, which was before us.<br><a name="11">11</a>  [There is] no remembrance of former [things]; neither shall there be [any] remembrance of [things] that are to come with [those] that shall come after.<br><a name="12">12</a>. I the Preacher was king over Israel in Jerusalem.<br><a name="13">13</a>  And I gave my heart to seek and search out by wisdom concerning all [things] that are done under heaven: this sore travail hath God given to the sons of man to be exercised therewith.<br><a name="14">14</a>  I have seen all the works that are done under the sun; and, behold, all [is] vanity and vexation of spirit.<br><a name="15">15</a>  [That which is] crooked cannot be made straight: and that which is wanting cannot be numbered.<br><a name="16">16</a>  I communed with mine own heart, saying, Lo, I am come to great estate, and have gotten more wisdom than all [they] that have been before me in Jerusalem: yea, my heart had great experience of wisdom and knowledge.<br><a name="17">17</a>  And I gave my heart to know wisdom, and to know madness and folly: I perceived that this also is vexation of spirit.<br><a name="18">18</a>  For in much wisdom [is] much grief: and he that increaseth knowledge increaseth sorrow.<br><br>Go to <a href="ecc2.htm#1">Ecclesiastes 2</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
