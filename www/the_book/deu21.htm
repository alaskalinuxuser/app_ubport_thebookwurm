Deuteronomy  21<br>1. If [one] be found slain in the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee to possess it, lying in the field, [and] it be not known who hath slain him:<br><a name="2">2</a>  Then thy elders and thy judges shall come forth, and they shall measure unto the cities which [are] round about him that is slain:<br><a name="3">3</a>  And it shall be, [that] the city [which is] next unto the slain man, even the elders of that city shall take an heifer, which hath not been wrought with, [and] which hath not drawn in the yoke;<br><a name="4">4</a>  And the elders of that city shall bring down the heifer unto a rough valley, which is neither eared nor sown, and shall strike off the heifer's neck there in the valley:<br><a name="5">5</a>  And the priests the sons of Levi shall come near; for them the LORD thy God hath chosen to minister unto him, and to bless in the name of the LORD; and by their word shall every controversy and every stroke be [tried]:<br><a name="6">6</a>  And all the elders of that city, [that are] next unto the slain [man], shall wash their hands over the heifer that is beheaded in the valley:<br><a name="7">7</a>  And they shall answer and say, Our hands have not shed this blood, neither have our eyes seen [it].<br><a name="8">8</a>  Be merciful, O LORD, unto thy people Israel, whom thou hast redeemed, and lay not innocent blood unto thy people of Israel's charge. And the blood shall be forgiven them.<br><a name="9">9</a>  So shalt thou put away the [guilt of] innocent blood from among you, when thou shalt do [that which is] right in the sight of the LORD.<br><a name="10">10</a>. When thou goest forth to war against thine enemies, and the LORD thy God hath delivered them into thine hands, and thou hast taken them captive,<br><a name="11">11</a>  And seest among the captives a beautiful woman, and hast a desire unto her, that thou wouldest have her to thy wife;<br><a name="12">12</a>  Then thou shalt bring her home to thine house; and she shall shave her head, and pare her nails;<br><a name="13">13</a>  And she shall put the raiment of her captivity from off her, and shall remain in thine house, and bewail her father and her mother a full month: and after that thou shalt go in unto her, and be her husband, and she shall be thy wife.<br><a name="14">14</a>  And it shall be, if thou have no delight in her, then thou shalt let her go whither she will; but thou shalt not sell her at all for money, thou shalt not make merchandise of her, because thou hast humbled her.<br><a name="15">15</a>. If a man have two wives, one beloved, and another hated, and they have born him children, [both] the beloved and the hated; and [if] the firstborn son be hers that was hated:<br><a name="16">16</a>  Then it shall be, when he maketh his sons to inherit [that] which he hath, [that] he may not make the son of the beloved firstborn before the son of the hated, [which is indeed] the firstborn:<br><a name="17">17</a>  But he shall acknowledge the son of the hated [for] the firstborn, by giving him a double portion of all that he hath: for he [is] the beginning of his strength; the right of the firstborn [is] his.<br><a name="18">18</a>. If a man have a stubborn and rebellious son, which will not obey the voice of his father, or the voice of his mother, and [that], when they have chastened him, will not hearken unto them:<br><a name="19">19</a>  Then shall his father and his mother lay hold on him, and bring him out unto the elders of his city, and unto the gate of his place;<br><a name="20">20</a>  And they shall say unto the elders of his city, This our son [is] stubborn and rebellious, he will not obey our voice; [he is] a glutton, and a drunkard.<br><a name="21">21</a>  And all the men of his city shall stone him with stones, that he die: so shalt thou put evil away from among you; and all Israel shall hear, and fear.<br><a name="22">22</a>  And if a man have committed a sin worthy of death, and he be to be put to death, and thou hang him on a tree:<br><a name="23">23</a>  His body shall not remain all night upon the tree, but thou shalt in any wise bury him that day; (for he that is hanged [is] accursed of God;) that thy land be not defiled, which the LORD thy God giveth thee [for] an inheritance.<br><br>Go to <a href="deu22.htm#1">Deuteronomy 22</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
