Hosea   7<br>1. When I would have healed Israel, then the iniquity of Ephraim was discovered, and the wickedness of Samaria: for they commit falsehood; and the thief cometh in, [and] the troop of robbers spoileth without.<br><a name="2">2</a>  And they consider not in their hearts [that] I remember all their wickedness: now their own doings have beset them about; they are before my face.<br><a name="3">3</a>  They make the king glad with their wickedness, and the princes with their lies.<br><a name="4">4</a>  They [are] all adulterers, as an oven heated by the baker, [who] ceaseth from raising after he hath kneaded the dough, until it be leavened.<br><a name="5">5</a>  In the day of our king the princes have made [him] sick with bottles of wine; he stretched out his hand with scorners.<br><a name="6">6</a>  For they have made ready their heart like an oven, whiles they lie in wait: their baker sleepeth all the night; in the morning it burneth as a flaming fire.<br><a name="7">7</a>  They are all hot as an oven, and have devoured their judges; all their kings are fallen: [there is] none among them that calleth unto me.<br><a name="8">8</a>. Ephraim, he hath mixed himself among the people; Ephraim is a cake not turned.<br><a name="9">9</a>  Strangers have devoured his strength, and he knoweth [it] not: yea, gray hairs are here and there upon him, yet he knoweth not.<br><a name="10">10</a>  And the pride of Israel testifieth to his face: and they do not return to the LORD their God, nor seek him for all this.<br><a name="11">11</a>  Ephraim also is like a silly dove without heart: they call to Egypt, they go to Assyria.<br><a name="12">12</a>  When they shall go, I will spread my net upon them; I will bring them down as the fowls of the heaven; I will chastise them, as their congregation hath heard.<br><a name="13">13</a>  Woe unto them! for they have fled from me: destruction unto them! because they have transgressed against me: though I have redeemed them, yet they have spoken lies against me.<br><a name="14">14</a>  And they have not cried unto me with their heart, when they howled upon their beds: they assemble themselves for corn and wine, [and] they rebel against me.<br><a name="15">15</a>  Though I have bound [and] strengthened their arms, yet do they imagine mischief against me.<br><a name="16">16</a>  They return, [but] not to the most High: they are like a deceitful bow: their princes shall fall by the sword for the rage of their tongue: this [shall be] their derision in the land of Egypt.<br><br>Go to <a href="hos8.htm#1">Hosea 8</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
