In the end of the sabbath, as it began to dawn toward the first [day] of the week, came Mary Magdalene and the other Mary to see the sepulchre.<br><a name="2">2</a>  And, behold, there was a great earthquake: for the angel of the Lord descended from heaven, and came and rolled back the stone from the door, and sat upon it.<br><a name="3">3</a>  His countenance was like lightning, and his raiment white as snow:<br><a name="4">4</a>  And for fear of him the keepers did shake, and became as dead [men].<br><a name="5">5</a>  And the angel answered and said unto the women, Fear not ye: for I know that ye seek Jesus, which was crucified.<br><a name="6">6</a>  He is not here: for he is risen, as he said. Come, see the place where the Lord lay.<br><a name="7">7</a>  And go quickly, and tell his disciples that he is risen from the dead; and, behold, he goeth before you into Galilee; there shall ye see him: lo, I have told you.<br><a name="8">8</a>  And they departed quickly from the sepulchre with fear and great joy; and did run to bring his disciples word.<br><a name="9">9</a>  And as they went to tell his disciples, behold, Jesus met them, saying, All hail. And they came and held him by the feet, and worshipped him.<br><a name="10">10</a>  Then said Jesus unto them, Be not afraid: go tell my brethren that they go into Galilee, and there shall they see me.<br><a name="11">11</a>. Now when they were going, behold, some of the watch came into the city, and shewed unto the chief priests all the things that were done.<br><a name="12">12</a>  And when they were assembled with the elders, and had taken counsel, they gave large money unto the soldiers,<br><a name="13">13</a>  Saying, Say ye, His disciples came by night, and stole him [away] while we slept.<br><a name="14">14</a>  And if this come to the governor's ears, we will persuade him, and secure you.<br><a name="15">15</a>  So they took the money, and did as they were taught: and this saying is commonly reported among the Jews until this day.<br><a name="16">16</a>. Then the eleven disciples went away into Galilee, into a mountain where Jesus had appointed them.<br><a name="17">17</a>  And when they saw him, they worshipped him: but some doubted.<br> <a name="18"></a>18  And Jesus came and spake unto them, saying, All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth.<br><a name="19">19</a>  Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost:<br><a name="20">20</a>  Teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you: and, lo, I am with you alway, [even] unto the end of the world.
