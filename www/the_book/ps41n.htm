<dl><dt><i><b>41:1 To the chief Musician, A Psalm of David.</b></i></dt><dl>
<dt>Like <a href="psa3.htm#1">Psalm 3</a>, this Psalm may have been written by David, during the rebellion led by his son Absalom.
<dd>However, the Lord Jesus Himself quoted from this Psalm in reference to His betrayal (see <a href="psa41.htm#9" target="lwr_lt">v.9</a>). Therefore, we can expect that the balance of the Psalm will speak of Him.
<dd>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As His spoken word applies this Psalm to a specific event, so, likewise, numerous passages, of God's written Word, shed so much light on the text of this Psalm, that very little explanatory commentary is necessary. By a comparison of scripture with scripture, the Lord opens His Word to His children. Therefore, the cross reference links are of central importance, to every study.</dl><dt><b><i>

the LORD will deliver him in time of trouble.</b></i></dt><dl>
<dt>the poor - lit., the weak, or the sick.

<dt>David experienced betrayal by a friend- <a href="2sam15.htm#12">2Sam 15:12,31</a>; <a href="psa55.htm#12">Psa 55:12-14,20-21</a>
<dt>Christ quoted this verse as fulfilled in Judas' betrayal: <a href="joh13.htm#18">Joh 13:&quot;18-19&quot;, 26-27</a>
<dd>Note, however, that He omits the portion of the verse which refers to his friendship.
<dd>Jesus knew from the beginning who would betray Him (<a href="joh6.htm#64">Joh 6:64,70</a>). Judas was never so familiar with Jesus as at the moment of betrayal. Even then, it was Jesus who addressed him as &quot;friend&quot; (<a href="mat26.htm#48">Mat 26:48-50</a>).</dl>
