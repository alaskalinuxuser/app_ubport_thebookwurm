Numbers   9<br>1. And the LORD spake unto Moses in the wilderness of Sinai, in the first month of the second year after they were come out of the land of Egypt, saying,<br><a name="2">2</a>  Let the children of Israel also keep the passover at his appointed season.<br><a name="3">3</a>  In the fourteenth day of this month, at even, ye shall keep it in his appointed season: according to all the rites of it, and according to all the ceremonies thereof, shall ye keep it.<br><a name="4">4</a>  And Moses spake unto the children of Israel, that they should keep the passover.<br><a name="5">5</a>  And they kept the passover on the fourteenth day of the first month at even in the wilderness of Sinai: according to all that the LORD commanded Moses, so did the children of Israel.<br><a name="6">6</a>  And there were certain men, who were defiled by the dead body of a man, that they could not keep the passover on that day: and they came before Moses and before Aaron on that day:<br><a name="7">7</a>  And those men said unto him, We [are] defiled by the dead body of a man: wherefore are we kept back, that we may not offer an offering of the LORD in his appointed season among the children of Israel?<br><a name="8">8</a>  And Moses said unto them, Stand still, and I will hear what the LORD will command concerning you.<br><a name="9">9</a>  And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,<br><a name="10">10</a>  Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, If any man of you or of your posterity shall be unclean by reason of a dead body, or [be] in a journey afar off, yet he shall keep the passover unto the LORD.<br><a name="11">11</a>  The fourteenth day of the second month at even they shall keep it, [and] eat it with unleavened bread and bitter [herbs].<br><a name="12">12</a>  They shall leave none of it unto the morning, nor break any bone of it: according to all the ordinances of the passover they shall keep it.<br><a name="13">13</a>  But the man that [is] clean, and is not in a journey, and forbeareth to keep the passover, even the same soul shall be cut off from among his people: because he brought not the offering of the LORD in his appointed season, that man shall bear his sin.<br><a name="14">14</a>  And if a stranger shall sojourn among you, and will keep the passover unto the LORD; according to the ordinance of the passover, and according to the manner thereof, so shall he do: ye shall have one ordinance, both for the stranger, and for him that was born in the land.<br><a name="15">15</a>. And on the day that the tabernacle was reared up the cloud covered the tabernacle, [namely], the tent of the testimony: and at even there was upon the tabernacle as it were the appearance of fire, until the morning.<br><a name="16">16</a>  So it was alway: the cloud covered it [by day], and the appearance of fire by night.<br><a name="17">17</a>  And when the cloud was taken up from the tabernacle, then after that the children of Israel journeyed: and in the place where the cloud abode, there the children of Israel pitched their tents.<br><a name="18">18</a>  At the commandment of the LORD the children of Israel journeyed, and at the commandment of the LORD they pitched: as long as the cloud abode upon the tabernacle they rested in their tents.<br><a name="19">19</a>  And when the cloud tarried long upon the tabernacle many days, then the children of Israel kept the charge of the LORD, and journeyed not.<br><a name="20">20</a>  And [so] it was, when the cloud was a few days upon the tabernacle; according to the commandment of the LORD they abode in their tents, and according to the commandment of the LORD they journeyed.<br><a name="21">21</a>  And [so] it was, when the cloud abode from even unto the morning, and [that] the cloud was taken up in the morning, then they journeyed: whether [it was] by day or by night that the cloud was taken up, they journeyed.<br><a name="22">22</a>  Or [whether it were] two days, or a month, or a year, that the cloud tarried upon the tabernacle, remaining thereon, the children of Israel abode in their tents, and journeyed not: but when it was taken up, they journeyed.<br><a name="23">23</a>  At the commandment of the LORD they rested in the tents, and at the commandment of the LORD they journeyed: they kept the charge of the LORD, at the commandment of the LORD by the hand of Moses.<br><br>Go to <a href="num10.htm#1">Numbers 10</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
