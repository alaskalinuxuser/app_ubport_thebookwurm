Romans   7<br> 1. Know ye not, brethren, (for I speak to them that know the law,) how that the law hath dominion over a man as long as he liveth?<br><a name="2">2</a>  For the woman which hath an husband is bound by the law to [her] husband so long as he liveth; but if the husband be dead, she is loosed from the law of [her] husband.<br><a name="3">3</a>  So then if, while [her] husband liveth, she be married to another man, she shall be called an adulteress: but if her husband be dead, she is free from that law; so that she is no adulteress, though she be married to another man.<br><a name="4">4</a>  Wherefore, my brethren, ye also are become dead to the law by the body of Christ; that ye should be married to another, [even] to him who is raised from the dead, that we should bring forth fruit unto God.<br><a name="5">5</a>  For when we were in the flesh, the motions of sins, which were by the law, did work in our members to bring forth fruit unto death.<br><a name="6">6</a>  But now we are delivered from the law, that being dead wherein we were held; that we should serve in newness of spirit, and not [in] the oldness of the letter.<br><a name="7">7</a>. What shall we say then? [Is] the law sin? God forbid. Nay, I had not known sin, but by the law: for I had not known lust, except the law had said, Thou shalt not covet.<br><a name="8">8</a>  But sin, taking occasion by the commandment, wrought in me all manner of concupiscence. For without the law sin [was] dead.<br><a name="9">9</a>  For I was alive without the law once: but when the commandment came, sin revived, and I died.<br><a name="10">10</a>  And the commandment, which [was ordained] to life, I found [to be] unto death.<br><a name="11">11</a>  For sin, taking occasion by the commandment, deceived me, and by it slew [me].<br><a name="12">12</a>  Wherefore the law [is] holy, and the commandment holy, and just, and good.<br><a name="13">13</a>  Was then that which is good made death unto me? God forbid. But sin, that it might appear sin, working death in me by that which is good; that sin by the commandment might become exceeding sinful.<br><a name="14">14</a>. For we know that the law is spiritual: but I am carnal, sold under sin.<br><a name="15">15</a>  For that which I do I allow not: for what I would, that do I not; but what I hate, that do I.<br><a name="16">16</a>  If then I do that which I would not, I consent unto the law that [it is] good.<br><a name="17">17</a>  Now then it is no more I that do it, but sin that dwelleth in me.<br><a name="18">18</a>  For I know that in me (that is, in my flesh,) dwelleth no good thing: for to will is present with me; but [how] to perform that which is good I find not.<br><a name="19">19</a>  For the good that I would I do not: but the evil which I would not, that I do.<br><a name="20">20</a>  Now if I do that I would not, it is no more I that do it, but sin that dwelleth in me.<br><a name="21">21</a>  I find then a law, that, when I would do good, evil is present with me.<br><a name="22">22</a>  For I delight in the law of God after the inward man:<br><a name="23">23</a>  But I see another law in my members, warring against the law of my mind, and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members.<br><a name="24">24</a>  O wretched man that I am! who shall deliver me from the body of this death?<br><a name="25">25</a>  I thank God through Jesus Christ our Lord. So then with the mind I myself serve the law of God; but with the flesh the law of sin.<br><br>Go to <a href="rom8.htm#1">Romans 8</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
