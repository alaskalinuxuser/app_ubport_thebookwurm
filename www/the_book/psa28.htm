Psalms  28<br>1. [A Psalm] of David. Unto thee will I cry, O LORD my rock; be not silent to me: lest, [if] thou be silent to me, I become like them that go down into the pit.<br><a name="2">2</a>  Hear the voice of my supplications, when I cry unto thee, when I lift up my hands toward thy holy oracle.<br><a name="3">3</a>  Draw me not away with the wicked, and with the workers of iniquity, which speak peace to their neighbours, but mischief [is] in their hearts.<br><a name="4">4</a>  Give them according to their deeds, and according to the wickedness of their endeavours: give them after the work of their hands; render to them their desert.<br><a name="5">5</a>  Because they regard not the works of the LORD, nor the operation of his hands, he shall destroy them, and not build them up.<br><a name="6">6</a>. Blessed [be] the LORD, because he hath heard the voice of my supplications.<br><a name="7">7</a>  The LORD [is] my strength and my shield; my heart trusted in him, and I am helped: therefore my heart greatly rejoiceth; and with my song will I praise him.<br><a name="8">8</a>  The LORD [is] their strength, and he [is] the saving strength of his anointed.<br><a name="9">9</a>  Save thy people, and bless thine inheritance: feed them also, and lift them up for ever.<br><br>Go to <a href="psa29.htm#1">Psalm 29</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
