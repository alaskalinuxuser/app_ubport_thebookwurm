Exodus   1<br>1. Now these [are] the names of the children of Israel, which came into Egypt; every man and his household came with Jacob.<br><a name="2">2</a>  Reuben, Simeon, Levi, and Judah,<br><a name="3">3</a>  Issachar, Zebulun, and Benjamin,<br><a name="4">4</a>  Dan, and Naphtali, Gad, and Asher.<br><a name="5">5</a>  And all the souls that came out of the loins of Jacob were seventy souls: for Joseph was in Egypt [already].<br><a name="6">6</a>  And Joseph died, and all his brethren, and all that generation.<br><a name="7">7</a>  And the children of Israel were fruitful, and increased abundantly, and multiplied, and waxed exceeding mighty; and the land was filled with them.<br><a name="8">8</a>. Now there arose up a new king over Egypt, which knew not Joseph.<br><a name="9">9</a>  And he said unto his people, Behold, the people of the children of Israel [are] more and mightier than we:<br><a name="10">10</a>  Come on, let us deal wisely with them; lest they multiply, and it come to pass, that, when there falleth out any war, they join also unto our enemies, and fight against us, and [so] get them up out of the land.<br><a name="11">11</a>  Therefore they did set over them taskmasters to afflict them with their burdens. And they built for Pharaoh treasure cities, Pithom and Raamses.<br><a name="12">12</a>  But the more they afflicted them, the more they multiplied and grew. And they were grieved because of the children of Israel.<br><a name="13">13</a>  And the Egyptians made the children of Israel to serve with rigour:<br><a name="14">14</a>  And they made their lives bitter with hard bondage, in morter, and in brick, and in all manner of service in the field: all their service, wherein they made them serve, [was] with rigour.<br><a name="15">15</a>. And the king of Egypt spake to the Hebrew midwives, of which the name of the one [was] Shiphrah, and the name of the other Puah:<br><a name="16">16</a>  And he said, When ye do the office of a midwife to the Hebrew women, and see [them] upon the stools; if it [be] a son, then ye shall kill him: but if it [be] a daughter, then she shall live.<br><a name="17">17</a>  But the midwives feared God, and did not as the king of Egypt commanded them, but saved the men children alive.<br><a name="18">18</a>  And the king of Egypt called for the midwives, and said unto them, Why have ye done this thing, and have saved the men children alive?<br><a name="19">19</a>  And the midwives said unto Pharaoh, Because the Hebrew women [are] not as the Egyptian women; for they [are] lively, and are delivered ere the midwives come in unto them.<br><a name="20">20</a>  Therefore God dealt well with the midwives: and the people multiplied, and waxed very mighty.<br><a name="21">21</a>  And it came to pass, because the midwives feared God, that he made them houses.<br><a name="22">22</a>  And Pharaoh charged all his people, saying, Every son that is born ye shall cast into the river, and every daughter ye shall save alive.<br><br>Go to <a href="ex2.htm#1">Exodus 2</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
