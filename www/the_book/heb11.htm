Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen.<br><a name="2">2</a>  For by it the elders obtained a good report.<br><a name="3"> 3</a>  Through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God, so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear.<br><a name="4">4</a>. By faith Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain, by which he obtained witness that he was righteous, God testifying of his gifts: and by it he being dead yet speaketh.<br><a name="5">5</a>  By faith Enoch was translated that he should not see death; and was not found, because God had translated him: for before his translation he had this testimony, that he pleased God.<br><a name="6">6</a>  But without faith [it is] impossible to please [him]: for he that cometh to God must believe that he is, and [that] he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him.<br><a name="7">7</a>  By faith Noah, being warned of God of things not seen as yet, moved with fear, prepared an ark to the saving of his house; by the which he condemned the world, and became heir of the righteousness which is by faith.<br><a name="8">8</a>  By faith Abraham, when he was called to go out into a place which he should after receive for an inheritance, obeyed; and he went out, not knowing whither he went.<br><a name="9">9</a>  By faith he sojourned in the land of promise, as [in] a strange country, dwelling in tabernacles with Isaac and Jacob, the heirs with him of the same promise:<br><a name="10">10</a>  For he looked for a city which hath foundations, whose builder and maker [is] God.<br><a name="11">11</a>  Through faith also Sara herself received strength to conceive seed, and was delivered of a child when she was past age, because she judged him faithful who had promised.<br><a name="12">12</a>  Therefore sprang there even of one, and him as good as dead, [so many] as the stars of the sky in multitude, and as the sand which is by the sea shore innumerable.<br><a name="13">13</a>  These all died in faith, not having received the promises, but having seen them afar off, and were persuaded of [them], and embraced [them], and confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth.<br><a name="14">14</a>  For they that say such things declare plainly that they seek a country.<br><a name="15">15</a>  And truly, if they had been mindful of that [country] from whence they came out, they might have had opportunity to have returned.<br><a name="16">16</a>  But now they desire a better [country], that is, an heavenly: wherefore God is not ashamed to be called their God: for he hath prepared for them a city.<br><a name="17">17</a>  By faith Abraham, when he was tried, offered up Isaac: and he that had received the promises offered up his only begotten [son],<br><a name="18">18</a>  Of whom it was said, That in Isaac shall thy seed be called:<br><a name="19">19</a>  Accounting that God [was] able to raise [him] up, even from the dead; from whence also he received him in a figure.<br><a name="20">20</a>  By faith Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau concerning things to come.<br><a name="21">21</a>  By faith Jacob, when he was a dying, blessed both the sons of Joseph; and worshipped, [leaning] upon the top of his staff.<br><a name="22">22</a>  By faith Joseph, when he died, made mention of the departing of the children of Israel; and gave commandment concerning his bones.<br><a name="23">23</a>  By faith Moses, when he was born, was hid three months of his parents, because they saw [he was] a proper child; and they were not afraid of the king's commandment.<br><a name="24">24</a>  By faith Moses, when he was come to years, refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter;<br><a name="25">25</a>  Choosing rather to suffer affliction with the people of God, than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season;<br><a name="26">26</a>  Esteeming the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures in Egypt: for he had respect unto the recompence of the reward.<br><a name="27">27</a>  By faith he forsook Egypt, not fearing the wrath of the king: for he endured, as seeing him who is invisible.<br><a name="28">28</a>  Through faith he kept the passover, and the sprinkling of blood, lest he that destroyed the firstborn should touch them.<br><a name="29">29</a>  By faith they passed through the Red sea as by dry [land]: which the Egyptians assaying to do were drowned.<br><a name="30">30</a>  By faith the walls of Jericho fell down, after they were compassed about seven days.<br><a name="31">31</a>  By faith the harlot Rahab perished not with them that believed not, when she had received the spies with peace.<br><a name="32">32</a>. And what shall I more say? for the time would fail me to tell of Gedeon, and [of] Barak, and [of] Samson, and [of] Jephthae; [of] David also, and Samuel, and [of] the prophets:<br><a name="33">33</a>  Who through faith subdued kingdoms, wrought righteousness, obtained promises, stopped the mouths of lions,<br><a name="34">34</a>  Quenched the violence of fire, escaped the edge of the sword, out of weakness were made strong, waxed valiant in fight, turned to flight the armies of the aliens.<br><a name="35">35</a>  Women received their dead raised to life again: and others were tortured, not accepting deliverance; that they might obtain a better resurrection:<br><a name="36">36</a>  And others had trial of [cruel] mockings and scourgings, yea, moreover of bonds and imprisonment:<br><a name="37">37</a>  They were stoned, they were sawn asunder, were tempted, were slain with the sword: they wandered about in sheepskins and goatskins; being destitute, afflicted, tormented;<br><a name="38">38</a>  (Of whom the world was not worthy:) they wandered in deserts, and [in] mountains, and [in] dens and caves of the earth.<br><a name="39">39</a>  And these all, having obtained a good report through faith, received not the promise:<br><a name="40">40</a>  God having provided some better thing for us, that they without us should not be made perfect.<br><br>Go to <a href="heb12.htm#1">Hebrews 12</a>
