Ecclesiastes   4<br>1. So I returned, and considered all the oppressions that are done under the sun: and behold the tears of [such as were] oppressed, and they had no comforter; and on the side of their oppressors [there was] power; but they had no comforter.<br><a name="2">2</a>  Wherefore I praised the dead which are already dead more than the living which are yet alive.<br><a name="3">3</a>  Yea, better [is he] than both they, which hath not yet been, who hath not seen the evil work that is done under the sun.<br><a name="4">4</a>. Again, I considered all travail, and every right work, that for this a man is envied of his neighbour. This [is] also vanity and vexation of spirit.<br><a name="5">5</a>  The fool foldeth his hands together, and eateth his own flesh.<br><a name="6">6</a>  Better [is] an handful [with] quietness, than both the hands full [with] travail and vexation of spirit.<br><a name="7">7</a>. Then I returned, and I saw vanity under the sun.<br><a name="8">8</a>  There is one [alone], and [there is] not a second; yea, he hath neither child nor brother: yet [is there] no end of all his labour; neither is his eye satisfied with riches; neither [saith he], For whom do I labour, and bereave my soul of good? This [is] also vanity, yea, it [is] a sore travail.<br><a name="9">9</a>  Two [are] better than one; because they have a good reward for their labour.<br><a name="10">10</a>  For if they fall, the one will lift up his fellow: but woe to him [that is] alone when he falleth; for [he hath] not another to help him up.<br><a name="11">11</a>  Again, if two lie together, then they have heat: but how can one be warm [alone]?<br><a name="12">12</a>  And if one prevail against him, two shall withstand him; and a threefold cord is not quickly broken.<br><a name="13">13</a>. Better [is] a poor and a wise child than an old and foolish king, who will no more be admonished.<br><a name="14">14</a>  For out of prison he cometh to reign; whereas also [he that is] born in his kingdom becometh poor.<br><a name="15">15</a>  I considered all the living which walk under the sun, with the second child that shall stand up in his stead.<br><a name="16">16</a>  [There is] no end of all the people, [even] of all that have been before them: they also that come after shall not rejoice in him. Surely this also [is] vanity and vexation of spirit.<br><br>Go to <a href="ecc5.htm#1">Ecclesiastes 5</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
