Numbers  22<br>1. And the children of Israel set forward, and pitched in the plains of Moab on this side Jordan [by] Jericho.<br><a name="2">2</a>  And Balak the son of Zippor saw all that Israel had done to the Amorites.<br><a name="3">3</a>  And Moab was sore afraid of the people, because they [were] many: and Moab was distressed because of the children of Israel.<br><a name="4">4</a>  And Moab said unto the elders of Midian, Now shall this company lick up all [that are] round about us, as the ox licketh up the grass of the field. And Balak the son of Zippor [was] king of the Moabites at that time.<br><a name="5">5</a>  He sent messengers therefore unto Balaam the son of Beor to Pethor, which [is] by the river of the land of the children of his people, to call him, saying, Behold, there is a people come out from Egypt: behold, they cover the face of the earth, and they abide over against me:<br><a name="6">6</a>  Come now therefore, I pray thee, curse me this people; for they [are] too mighty for me: peradventure I shall prevail, [that] we may smite them, and [that] I may drive them out of the land: for I wot that he whom thou blessest [is] blessed, and he whom thou cursest is cursed.<br><a name="7">7</a>  And the elders of Moab and the elders of Midian departed with the rewards of divination in their hand; and they came unto Balaam, and spake unto him the words of Balak.<br><a name="8">8</a>  And he said unto them, Lodge here this night, and I will bring you word again, as the LORD shall speak unto me: and the princes of Moab abode with Balaam.<br><a name="9">9</a>  And God came unto Balaam, and said, What men [are] these with thee?<br><a name="10">10</a>  And Balaam said unto God, Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab, hath sent unto me, [saying],<br><a name="11">11</a>  Behold, [there is] a people come out of Egypt, which covereth the face of the earth: come now, curse me them; peradventure I shall be able to overcome them, and drive them out.<br><a name="12">12</a>  And God said unto Balaam, Thou shalt not go with them; thou shalt not curse the people: for they [are] blessed.<br><a name="13">13</a>  And Balaam rose up in the morning, and said unto the princes of Balak, Get you into your land: for the LORD refuseth to give me leave to go with you.<br><a name="14">14</a>  And the princes of Moab rose up, and they went unto Balak, and said, Balaam refuseth to come with us.<br><a name="15">15</a>. And Balak sent yet again princes, more, and more honourable than they.<br><a name="16">16</a>  And they came to Balaam, and said to him, Thus saith Balak the son of Zippor, Let nothing, I pray thee, hinder thee from coming unto me:<br><a name="17">17</a>  For I will promote thee unto very great honour, and I will do whatsoever thou sayest unto me: come therefore, I pray thee, curse me this people.<br><a name="18">18</a>  And Balaam answered and said unto the servants of Balak, If Balak would give me his house full of silver and gold, I cannot go beyond the word of the LORD my God, to do less or more.<br><a name="19">19</a>  Now therefore, I pray you, tarry ye also here this night, that I may know what the LORD will say unto me more.<br><a name="20">20</a>  And God came unto Balaam at night, and said unto him, If the men come to call thee, rise up, [and] go with them; but yet the word which I shall say unto thee, that shalt thou do.<br><a name="21">21</a>  And Balaam rose up in the morning, and saddled his ass, and went with the princes of Moab.<br><a name="22">22</a>. And God's anger was kindled because he went: and the angel of the LORD stood in the way for an adversary against him. Now he was riding upon his ass, and his two servants [were] with him.<br><a name="23">23</a>  And the ass saw the angel of the LORD standing in the way, and his sword drawn in his hand: and the ass turned aside out of the way, and went into the field: and Balaam smote the ass, to turn her into the way.<br><a name="24">24</a>  But the angel of the LORD stood in a path of the vineyards, a wall [being] on this side, and a wall on that side.<br><a name="25">25</a>  And when the ass saw the angel of the LORD, she thrust herself unto the wall, and crushed Balaam's foot against the wall: and he smote her again.<br><a name="26">26</a>  And the angel of the LORD went further, and stood in a narrow place, where [was] no way to turn either to the right hand or to the left.<br><a name="27">27</a>  And when the ass saw the angel of the LORD, she fell down under Balaam: and Balaam's anger was kindled, and he smote the ass with a staff.<br><a name="28">28</a>  And the LORD opened the mouth of the ass, and she said unto Balaam, What have I done unto thee, that thou hast smitten me these three times?<br><a name="29">29</a>  And Balaam said unto the ass, Because thou hast mocked me: I would there were a sword in mine hand, for now would I kill thee.<br><a name="30">30</a>  And the ass said unto Balaam, [Am] not I thine ass, upon which thou hast ridden ever since [I was] thine unto this day? was I ever wont to do so unto thee? And he said, Nay.<br><a name="31">31</a>  Then the LORD opened the eyes of Balaam, and he saw the angel of the LORD standing in the way, and his sword drawn in his hand: and he bowed down his head, and fell flat on his face.<br><a name="32">32</a>  And the angel of the LORD said unto him, Wherefore hast thou smitten thine ass these three times? behold, I went out to withstand thee, because [thy] way is perverse before me:<br><a name="33">33</a>  And the ass saw me, and turned from me these three times: unless she had turned from me, surely now also I had slain thee, and saved her alive.<br><a name="34">34</a>  And Balaam said unto the angel of the LORD, I have sinned; for I knew not that thou stoodest in the way against me: now therefore, if it displease thee, I will get me back again.<br><a name="35">35</a>  And the angel of the LORD said unto Balaam, Go with the men: but only the word that I shall speak unto thee, that thou shalt speak. So Balaam went with the princes of Balak.<br><a name="36">36</a>. And when Balak heard that Balaam was come, he went out to meet him unto a city of Moab, which [is] in the border of Arnon, which [is] in the utmost coast.<br><a name="37">37</a>  And Balak said unto Balaam, Did I not earnestly send unto thee to call thee? wherefore camest thou not unto me? am I not able indeed to promote thee to honour?<br><a name="38">38</a>  And Balaam said unto Balak, Lo, I am come unto thee: have I now any power at all to say any thing? the word that God putteth in my mouth, that shall I speak.<br><a name="39">39</a>  And Balaam went with Balak, and they came unto Kirjathhuzoth.<br><a name="40">40</a>  And Balak offered oxen and sheep, and sent to Balaam, and to the princes that [were] with him.<br><a name="41">41</a>  And it came to pass on the morrow, that Balak took Balaam, and brought him up into the high places of Baal, that thence he might see the utmost [part] of the people.<br><br>Go to <a href="num23.htm#1">Numbers 23</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
