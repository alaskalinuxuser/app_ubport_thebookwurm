Isaiah   1<br> 1. The vision of Isaiah the son of Amoz, which he saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, [and] Hezekiah, kings of Judah.<br><a name="2">2</a>. Hear, O heavens, and give ear, O earth: for the LORD hath spoken, I have nourished and brought up children, and they have rebelled against me.<br><a name="3">3</a>  The ox knoweth his owner, and the ass his master's crib: [but] Israel doth not know, my people doth not consider.<br><a name="4">4</a>  Ah sinful nation, a people laden with iniquity, a seed of evildoers, children that are corrupters: they have forsaken the LORD, they have provoked the Holy One of Israel unto anger, they are gone away backward.<br><a name="5">5</a>  Why should ye be stricken any more? ye will revolt more and more: the whole head is sick, and the whole heart faint.<br><a name="6">6</a>  From the sole of the foot even unto the head [there is] no soundness in it; [but] wounds, and bruises, and putrifying sores: they have not been closed, neither bound up, neither mollified with ointment.<br><a name="7">7</a>  Your country [is] desolate, your cities [are] burned with fire: your land, strangers devour it in your presence, and [it is] desolate, as overthrown by strangers.<br><a name="8">8</a>  And the daughter of Zion is left as a cottage in a vineyard, as a lodge in a garden of cucumbers, as a besieged city.<br><a name="9">9</a>  Except the LORD of hosts had left unto us a very small remnant, we should have been as Sodom, [and] we should have been like unto Gomorrah.<br><a name="10">10</a>. Hear the word of the LORD, ye rulers of Sodom; give ear unto the law of our God, ye people of Gomorrah.<br><a name="11">11</a>  To what purpose [is] the multitude of your sacrifices unto me? saith the LORD: I am full of the burnt offerings of rams, and the fat of fed beasts; and I delight not in the blood of bullocks, or of lambs, or of he goats.<br><a name="12">12</a>  When ye come to appear before me, who hath required this at your hand, to tread my courts?<br><a name="13">13</a>  Bring no more vain oblations; incense is an abomination unto me; the new moons and sabbaths, the calling of assemblies, I cannot away with; [it is] iniquity, even the solemn meeting.<br><a name="14">14</a>  Your new moons and your appointed feasts my soul hateth: they are a trouble unto me; I am weary to bear [them].<br><a name="15">15</a>  And when ye spread forth your hands, I will hide mine eyes from you: yea, when ye make many prayers, I will not hear: your hands are full of blood.<br><a name="16">16</a>. Wash you, make you clean; put away the evil of your doings from before mine eyes; cease to do evil;<br><a name="17">17</a>  Learn to do well; seek judgment, relieve the oppressed, judge the fatherless, plead for the widow.<br><a name="18">18</a>  Come now, and let us reason together, saith the LORD: though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they be red like crimson, they shall be as wool.<br><a name="19">19</a>  If ye be willing and obedient, ye shall eat the good of the land:<br><a name="20">20</a>  But if ye refuse and rebel, ye shall be devoured with the sword: for the mouth of the LORD hath spoken [it].<br><a name="21">21</a>. How is the faithful city become an harlot! it was full of judgment; righteousness lodged in it; but now murderers.<br><a name="22">22</a>  Thy silver is become dross, thy wine mixed with water:<br><a name="23">23</a>  Thy princes [are] rebellious, and companions of thieves: every one loveth gifts, and followeth after rewards: they judge not the fatherless, neither doth the cause of the widow come unto them.<br><a name="24">24</a>  Therefore saith the Lord, the LORD of hosts, the mighty One of Israel, Ah, I will ease me of mine adversaries, and avenge me of mine enemies:<br><a name="25">25</a>  And I will turn my hand upon thee, and purely purge away thy dross, and take away all thy tin:<br><a name="26">26</a>  And I will restore thy judges as at the first, and thy counsellors as at the beginning: afterward thou shalt be called, The city of righteousness, the faithful city.<br><a name="27">27</a>  Zion shall be redeemed with judgment, and her converts with righteousness.<br><a name="28">28</a>  And the destruction of the transgressors and of the sinners [shall be] together, and they that forsake the LORD shall be consumed.<br><a name="29">29</a>  For they shall be ashamed of the oaks which ye have desired, and ye shall be confounded for the gardens that ye have chosen.<br><a name="30">30</a>  For ye shall be as an oak whose leaf fadeth, and as a garden that hath no water.<br><a name="31">31</a>  And the strong shall be as tow, and the maker of it as a spark, and they shall both burn together, and none shall quench [them].<br><br>Go to <a href="isa2.htm#1">Isaiah 2</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
