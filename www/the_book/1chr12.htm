Then David received them, and made them captains of the band.<br><a name="19">19</a>  And there fell [some] of Manasseh to David, when he came with the Philistines against Saul to battle: but they helped them not: for the lords of the Philistines upon advisement sent him away, saying, He will fall to his master Saul to [the jeopardy of] our heads.<br><a name="20">20</a>  As he went to Ziklag, there fell to him of Manasseh, Adnah, and Jozabad, and Jediael, and Michael, and Jozabad, and Elihu, and Zilthai, captains of the thousands that [were] of Manasseh.<br><a name="21">21</a>  And they helped David against the band [of the rovers]: for they [were] all mighty men of valour, and were captains in the host.<br><a name="22">22</a>  For at [that] time day by day there came to David to help him, until [it was] a great host, like the host of God.<br><a name="23">23</a>.
