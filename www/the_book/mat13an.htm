<dl><dt>
<b><i>13:1  The same day went Jesus out of the house, and sat by the sea side.<br>
13:2  And great multitudes were gathered together unto him, so that he went into a ship, and sat; <br>
and the whole multitude stood on the shore.</b></i></dt><dl>
<dt>The great multitudes which followed Him (mostly for cures and out of curiousity) had not been receptive to the Gospel of the Kingdom.
<dd>Therefore, at the end of ch. 11, Jesus, the King, began to redirect His message, from a national offer of the Kingdom, to a personal offer of salvation. Although the purposes of God remained hidden from most people, the Father would reveal the Son to some (<a href="mat11.htm#25">11:25-27</a>). To these, Jesus called, &quot;Come unto Me, all ye who labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest...&quot; (<a href="mat11.htm#28">11:28-30</a>).
<dd>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the people had been unreceptive, the political and religious leaders were in outright opposition. They sought to discredit His ministry, and were conspiring to destroy Him. They rejected, not only His words and miraculous works, but also the testimony of the Holy Spirit (<a href="mat12.htm#24">12:24,31,32</a>). 
<dt>The same day...- At the end of ch. 12, His mother and brothers had sought to speak with Him.<dd>
Even His family and friends did not understand. Some thought He was crazy. Most did not believe. Yet, the Holy Spirit was working in 
 hearts. His true spiritual family would hear, believe and follow God's Word (<a href="mat12.htm#46">12:46-50</a>). Therefore, He proclaimed it to all who would listen.
<dt>...he went into a ship, and sat...-<dd>The crowd was clamoring with those who sought to be healed. But their great need was to hear the Word of God. As He drew back from them, the people quieted themselves, and waited. The King, knowing that the nation had rejected Him, presented seven parables concerning the character of His Kingdom, in His absence.</dl><dt>&nbsp;
<dt>Seven Parables: The Mysteries of the Kingdom of Heaven (ch. 13)
<dd>Parable #1- The Sower and the Soils (<a href="mat13.htm#3" target="lwr_lt">v.3-9</a>, explained <a href="mat13.htm#18" target="lwr_lt">v.18-23</a>)<dt><dt>
<dt><b><i>13:3  And he spake many things unto them in parables, saying, <br>
Behold, a sower went forth to sow;<br>
13:4  And when he sowed, some [seeds] fell by the way side, <br>
and the fowls came and devoured them up:<br>
13:5  Some fell upon stony places, where they had not much earth: <br>
and forthwith they sprung up, because they had no deepness of earth:<br>
13:6  And when the sun was up, they were scorched; <br>
and because they had no root, they withered away.<br>
13:7  And some fell among thorns; and the thorns sprung up, and choked them:<br>
13:8  But other fell into good ground, <br>
and brought forth fruit, some an hundredfold, some sixtyfold, some thirtyfold.<br>
13:9  Who hath ears to hear, let him hear.</i></b></dt><dl>
<dt>He spoke in parables- GK=parabole, lit., 'a placing beside,' a comparison.
<dd>He used analogy from the natural world to 'measure out' spiritual truth.
<dt>he that hath ears to hear...-<dd>It is one thing to hear. It is another to hear with understanding.<br>It is one thing to listen to words. It is another to allow those words to take root and bring change to your heart and life.
<dt>...let him hear- Jesus did not leave us to speculate about the meaning of the parables in this chapter. <dd>As we will see shortly, all seven parables are clearly understood by the keys which He provided in His interpretation of the first two parables. </dl><dt>
<a name="10"></a>
<b><i>13:10  And the disciples came, and said unto him, <br>
Why speakest thou unto them in parables?<br>
13:11  He answered and said unto them, <br>
Because it is given unto you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven, <br>
but to them it is not given.<br>
13:12  For whosoever hath, to him shall be given, and he shall have more abundance: <br>
but whosoever hath not, from him shall be taken away even that he hath.<br>
13:13  Therefore speak I to them in parables: because they seeing see not; <br>
and hearing they hear not, neither do they understand.<br>
13:14  And in them is fulfilled the prophecy of Esaias, which saith, <br>
By hearing ye shall hear, and shall not understand; <br>
and seeing ye shall see, and shall not perceive:<br>
13:15  For this people's heart is waxed gross, <br>
and [their] ears are dull of hearing, and their eyes they have closed; <br>
lest at any time they should see with [their] eyes, and hear with [their] ears, <br>
and should understand with [their] heart, and should be converted, and I should heal them.<br>
13:16  But blessed [are] your eyes, for they see: and your ears, for they hear.<br>
13:17  For verily I say unto you, That many prophets and righteous [men] have desired <br>
to see [those things] which ye see, and have not seen [them]; <br>
and to hear [those things] which ye hear, and have not heard [them].</i></b></dt><dl>
<dt>it is given unto you to know {ie., to understand}... but to them it is not given-
<dd>His people ('them,' the Jewish nation) had not been willing to receive the truth which they had heard.<br>
Therefore, they would hear truth that they would not understand. cp. <a href="mar4.htm#24">Mark 4:24,25</a>; <a href="joh7.htm#17">Joh 7:17</a><br>
This blindness to truth came as a judgment upon them, in fulfillment of prophecy. cp. <a href="mat13.htm#14" target="lwr_lt">v.14,15</a>; <a href="isa6.htm#9">Isa 6:9,10</a>
<dt>it is given unto you {ie., to Jesus' disciples} to know 'the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven.'-<dd>What does this mean?<ol type="A">
<li><i>The kingdom of heaven</i>, in Matthew, is primarily God's rule as it influences the earth.<br>It is the reign of heaven's King over the affairs of earth. cp. <a href="mat6.htm#10">Mat 6:10</a>
<li><i>Mysteries</i>, in scripture, are truths which remain hidden until God makes them known.<br>cp. the word 'mystery' in <a href="eph3.htm#1">Eph 3:1-12</a>; <a href="rom11.htm#25">Rom 11:25</a>;  <a href="col1.htm#26">Col 1:26-27</a>; <a href="1cor15.htm#51">1Cor 15:51-52</a>.
<li><i>The mysteries of the kingdom of heaven</i>, therefore, describe aspects of the kingdom which  previously were not understood by the OT prophets.<ol type="a">
<li>The OT prophets foretold the Kingdom as:<ul>
<li>Righteousness covering the earth. <a href="isa11.htm#5">Isa 11:5-12</a>
<li>Centered around the personal presence of the King. <a href="jer23.htm#5">Jer 23:5,6</a>; <a href="psa48.htm#1">Psa 48:1,2</a></ul>
<li>The OT prophets did not understand (cp. <a href="mat13.htm#17" target="lwr_lt">v.17</a>; <a href="1pet1.htm#10">1Pet 1:10-12</a>):<ol type="1">
<li>The rejection of the King.-<br>
Although, the prophets foretold the Messiah's suffering and death, this seemed so incompatible with His glory as King, that some rabbis taught that there would be two different Messiahs.
<li>The interval of time between the King's rejection (at His first coming),<br>and His enthronement (at His second coming).</ol></ol>
Therefore, in these seven parables, the King reveals the condition of His Kingdom during the period of His absence. (cp. <a href="mat25.htm#14">Mat 25:14</a>)<ul>
<li>Note that although the Church Age occupies most of this period, 'the Kingdom of Heaven' is not synonymous with 'the Church.' Rather, the term describes 'Christendom,' which covers the entire earthly realm of the King's influence, and includes unbelievers, counterfeit believers (mere professors), and true believers.</ul></ol>
<dt>Jesus interprets the parable of the Sower and the Soils:</dl><dt>
<b><i>13:18  Hear ye therefore</i></b> {cp. <a href="mat13.htm#16" target="lwr_lt">v.16</a>} <b><i>the parable of the sower.<br>
13:19  When any one heareth the word of the kingdom, and understandeth [it] not, <br>
then cometh the wicked [one], and catcheth away that which was sown in his heart. <br>
This is he which received seed by the way side.<br>
13:20  But he that received the seed into stony places, <br>
the same is he that heareth the word, and anon</b></i> {ie., immediately}<i><b> with joy receiveth it;<br>
13:21  Yet hath he not root in himself, but dureth</b></i> {ie., endureth} <b><i>for a while: <br>
for when tribulation or persecution ariseth because of the word, by and by he is offended.<br>
13:22  He also that received seed among the thorns is he that heareth the word; <br>
and the care of this world, and the deceitfulness of riches, choke the word, and he becometh unfruitful.<br>
13:23  But he that received seed into the good ground is <br>
he that heareth the word, and understandeth [it]; <br>
which also beareth fruit, and bringeth forth, some an hundredfold, some sixty, some thirty.</i></b></dt><dl>
<dt><i>The sower</i> is the Son of man {ie., Christ} (cp. <a href="mat13.htm#3" target="lwr_lt">v.3</a> and <a href="mat13.htm#37" target="lwr_lt">v.37</a>)- 
<dt><i>The field</i> {in which he sows seed} is the world (cp. <a href="mat13.htm#38" target="lwr_lt">v.38</a>)-
<dd>Note that during this 'mystery' period, the King is not on His throne in Jerusalem,
<dd>nor does He limit His labors to God's vineyard (Israel, <a href="isa5.htm#1">Isa 5:1-7</a>) as He did during the period of His earthly ministry (<a href="mat10.htm#5">Mat 10:5-7</a>).
<dd>Rather, the Lord Jesus is sowing seed in the world {GK=kosmos} (ie., to all humanity). <ul><li>A hint of this transition may be seen in <a href="mat13.htm#1" target="lwr_lt">13:1</a>, where Jesus...<ol type="a"><li>...went out of the house...<br>(symbolic of the house of Israel, which had rejected Him, ch.11, 12, cp. <a href="mat12.htm#43">12:43-45</a>)<li>...sat by the sea... (symbolic of the sea of humanity, including gentiles).</ol>
<li>He involves His children in this work of sowing, but it is the labor of His heart.<br>(cp. <a href="psa126.htm#5">Psa 126:5</a> ''they...'' and <a href="psa126.htm#6">:6</a> ''He...'')<ul><li>The work of a sower is not easy. It is engaged with 'tears' and 'weeping.'<li>The work of a sower requires faith that God will give the increase and a joyful harvest. The season for sowing passes quickly. The laborers must not allow discouragements and hindrances to keep them from the task. <a href="pro20.htm#4">Pro 20:4</a>; <a href="ecc11.htm#4">Ecc 11:4-6</a></ul></ul>
<dt><i>The seed</i> is 'the Word' (<a href="mar4.htm#14">Mark 4:14</a>), 'the Word of God' (<a href="luk8.htm#11">Luk 8:11</a>), 'the Word of the Kingdom' (<a href="mat13.htm#19" target="lwr_lt">v.19</a>).
<dd>The seed is <i>not</i> the 'Gospel of the Kingdom' (ie., the offer of the Kingdom to Israel, cp. <a href="mat4.htm#23">4:23</a>; <a href="mat9.htm#35">9:35</a>),<br>
but rather the invitation of the King to individuals, to become His subjects (cp. <a href="mat11.htm#28">11:28-30</a>).
<dt><i>The soil</i> is the hearts of men (<a href="mat13.htm#19" target="lwr_lt">v.19</a>) (a fitting analogy for sinful hearts, <a href="rom3.htm#9">Rom 3:9-20</a>).
<dd>Men's hearts vary as to their receptivity to the Word of God.-<ol type="a">
<li>by the wayside (<a href="mat13.htm#4" target="lwr_lt">v.4</a>; <a href="mat13.htm#19" target="lwr_lt">v.19</a>)- ie., on the hard packed pathway.<br>The birds (ie., Satan and his emissaries) snatch the Word out of the hardened heart before it can sprout. cp. <a href="luk8.htm#12">Luk 8:12</a>; <a href="2cor4.htm#3">2Cor 4:3,4</a>; <a href="joh3.htm#19">Joh 3:19,20</a>
<li>the stony, shallow ground (<a href="mat13.htm#5" target="lwr_lt">v.5,6</a>; <a href="mat13.htm#20" target="lwr_lt">v.20,21</a>)- These receive the Word with initial enthusiasm, <br>but their response is based on fleshly emotionalism, rather than being rooted in God's promises. When opposition arises, &quot;because of the Word,&quot; their faith cannot endure, because they do not fully know and trust God's Word.<br>They turn away, because they are 'offended' {GK=skandalizo, to stumble at a stumbling block}. <a href="mat13.htm#54" target="lwr_lt">13:54,57</a>; <a href="mat11.htm#6">11:6</a><br>cp. <a href="mar4.htm#16">Mark 4:16,17</a>; <a href="luk8.htm#13">Luk 8:13</a>; <a href="1joh2.htm#19">1Joh 2:19</a><br>(cf. those who are well 'rooted', <a href="psa1.htm#2">Psa 1:2,3</a>; <a href="eph3.htm#17">Eph 3:17</a>)
<li>the thorny ground (<a href="mat13.htm#7" target="lwr_lt">v.7</a>; <a href="mat13.htm#22" target="lwr_lt">v.22</a>; cp. <a href="mar4.htm#18">Mark 4:18,19</a>; <a href="luk8.htm#14">Luk 8:14</a>)-<br>These receive the Word but...<ul><li> their spiritual life cannot thrive due to worldly distractions, <br>which may take the form of 'want' ('the cares of this world'),<br>or 'prosperity' ('the deceitfulness of riches'). cp. <a href="1tim6.htm#9">1Tim 6:9,17</a><li>they become spiritually unfruitful (GK=akarpos, without fruit, barren). cp. <a href="joh15.htm#4">Joh 15:4-6</a><br>Like weeds, these distractions absorb the believer's spiritual nourishment, and crowd out his growth. He remains stunted, immature, and fruitless.</ul>
<li>the good ground (<a href="mat13.htm#8" target="lwr_lt">v.8</a>; <a href="mat13.htm#23" target="lwr_lt">v.23</a>; <a href="mar4.htm#20">Mark 4:20</a>; <a href="luk8.htm#15">Luk 8:15</a>)- ie., those individuals who...<ol type="1">
<li>hear the Word, cf. <a href="mat13.htm#15" target="lwr_lt">v.15,16</a>; cp. <a href="joh8.htm#47">Joh 8:47</a>; <a href="act17.htm#11">Acts 17:11</a>; <a href="1the2.htm#13">1The 2:13</a>
<li>understand the Word - 'understand' is GK=suniemi, to put or join together. This is more than mental assent. It is the bringing together of Truth, with Trust in the Truth. <a href="joh1.htm#11">Joh 1:11,12</a>; <a href="eph3.htm#14">Eph 3:14-19</a>; <a href="1joh5.htm#20">1Joh 5:20</a>
<li>bear fruit, cp. <a href="mat3.htm#8">Mat 3:8</a>; <a href="joh15.htm#1">Joh 15:1-8</a>; <a href="col1.htm#3">Col 1:3-6</a><br><ul><li>Fruit: The purpose, for which the Sower sowed the seed.<li>Fruit: That which God wants to see in your life, but which the flesh cannot produce. <a href="gal5.htm#19">Gal 5:19-21</a><li>Fruit: That which the Holy Spirit brings forth in the lives of those who receive God's Word, and feed upon it. <a href="gal5.htm#22">Gal 5:22,23</a></ul></ol>
What is the response of your heart to God's Word? cp. <a href="jam1.htm#21">Jam 1:21-25</a>;
<a href="psa1.htm#1">Psa 1:1-6</a></ol></dl><dt>&nbsp;
<dt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Parable #2- The Wheat and the Tares {weeds} (<a href="mat13.htm#24" target="lwr_lt">v.24-30</a>, explained <a href="mat13.htm#36" target="lwr_lt">v.36-43</a>)-<dt><dt>
<b><i>13:24  Another parable put he forth unto them, saying, <br>
The kingdom of heaven is likened unto a man which sowed good seed in his field:<br>
13:25  But while men slept, his enemy came and sowed tares among the wheat, and went his way.<br>
13:26  But when the blade was sprung up, and brought forth fruit, then appeared the tares also.<br>
13:27  So the servants of the householder came and said unto him, <br>
Sir, didst not thou sow good seed in thy field? from whence then hath it tares?<br>
13:28  He said unto them, An enemy hath done this. <br>
The servants said unto him, Wilt thou then that we go and gather them up?<br>
13:29  But he said, Nay; lest while ye gather up the tares, ye root up also the wheat with them.<br>
13:30  Let both grow together until the harvest: <br>
and in the time of harvest I will say to the reapers, <br>
Gather ye together first the tares, and bind them in bundles to burn them: <br>
but gather the wheat into my barn.</i></b></dt><dl>
<dt>Jesus interprets Parable #2 after He gives Parables #3 and #4.
<dd>We will consider His interpretation, when we come to it in the order of the text (in <a href="mat13.htm#36" target="lwr_lt">v.36-43</a>).
<dd>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me point out only that the analogy has changed. The good seed in this second parable, is not the Word of God, but rather those who have been born again through receiving the Word of God. These are the children of God, in whom the life of God has taken root (<a href="1joh3.htm#9">1Joh 3:9</a>). The Lord Jesus will make this clear to us, when He interprets this parable, a little later in the text.
<dd>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Parables #2, #3 and #4, all involve the influence of the seed which the Sower sowed in His field. He sows only good seed. But the influence of the good seed is diluted and distorted by the corrupting influences of an enemy.</dl><dt>&nbsp;
<dt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Parable #3- The Mustard Seed (<a href="mat13.htm#31" target="lwr_lt">v.31,32</a>)<dt><dt>
<b><i>13:31  Another parable put he forth unto them, saying, <br>
The kingdom of heaven is like to a grain of mustard seed, <br>
which a man took, and sowed in his field:<br>
13:32  Which indeed is the least of all seeds: <br>
but when it is grown, it is the greatest among herbs, and becometh a tree, <br>
so that the birds of the air come and lodge in the branches thereof.</i></b></dt><dl>
<dt>This parable shows ''the rapid but unsubstantial growth of the 'mystery' form of the kingdom
<dd>from an insignificant beginning (<a href="act1.htm#15">Acts 1:15</a>; <a href="act2.htm#41">2:41</a>; <a href="1cor1.htm#26">1Cor 1:26</a>) to a great place in the earth.'' [ScofRB]
<dt>mustard seed... among herbs... a tree...-
<dd>During Messiah's future reign on earth, His Kingdom is like a solid cedar. <a href="eze17.htm#22">Eze 17:22-24</a>
<dd>In contrast, during the mystery period, the Kingdom is like an overgrown 'herb.'<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Mustard' {GK=sinapi} may refer to <i>sinapis alba</i> or <i>sinapis arvensis.</i> These are annual plants, common to the region. From a relatively small, and rapidly germinating seed, the plant can reach the height of a small tree (around ten feet) in one season.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a picture of the church, not the true church, but that which the world sees as the church (ie., Christendom, the counterfeit church).-
<ul><li>It looks like a tree, but it is not strong.- Its rapid growth and size are impressive. But its woody stem is unable to bear much weight.
<li>It provides a 'flavor' of spirituality (mustard is a seasoning), but  it produces no lasting 'fruit.'
<li>It harbours birds, rather than over shadowing them.</ul>
<dt>birds... lodge {GK=kataskenoo, pitch their tents, find a place of rest} in the branches- 
<dd>'Birds' in <a href="mat13.htm#4" target="lwr_lt">Mat 13:4,19</a> are symbolic of the Devil and his emissaries, who pluck away the seed of the Word.
<dd>In the mystery period, apostate Christendom hosts the enemies of Christ's Word (<a href="rev18.htm#2">Rev 18:2,3</a>).
<br>Like the mustard plant, the duration of this roost for wickedness is limited to one season, after which it will be displaced by the Kingdom of Christ, which is the everlasting tree of God's planting. <a href="eze17.htm#24">Eze 17:24</a>; <a href="isa60.htm#21">Isa 60:21</a>; <a href="isa61.htm#3">61:3</a><br>(Note the parallel to the lesson that King Nebuchadnezzar had to learn. <a href="dan4.htm#20">Dan 4:20-25</a>)</dl><dt>&nbsp;
<dt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Parable #4- The Leaven (<a href="mat13.htm#33" target="lwr_lt">v.33</a>)<dt><dt><a name="33"></a>
<b><i>13:33  Another parable spake he unto them; <br>
The kingdom of heaven is like unto leaven, <br>
which a woman took, and hid in three measures of meal, till the whole was leavened.</i></b></dt><dl>
<dt>leaven- a catalyst of fermentation, is symbolic of evil and corruption throughout the Scriptures.
<dd>cp. <a href="mat16.htm#6">Mat 16:6,12</a>; <a href="1cor5.htm#6">1Cor 5:6-8</a>; <a href="gal5.htm#9">Gal 5:9</a>
<dt>a woman- when mentioned in regard to religious doctrine, is often symbolic of 
<dd>evil, error &amp; deception. cp. <a href="rev2.htm#20">Rev 2:20</a>; <a href="rev17.htm#1">17:1-7</a>; <a href="rev18.htm#1">18:1-5</a>
<dt>three measures of meal -  Meal (flour) is grain (seed) prepared for human consumption.
<dd>The Word of God (the seed, <a href="luk8.htm#11">Luk 8:11</a>) is the source of spiritual nourishment. <a href="mat4.htm#4">Mat 4:4</a>; <a href="1tim4.htm#6">1Tim 4:6</a>
<dd>'Three measures', suggests a full supply, all that is needed. cp. <a href="2pet1.htm#2">2Pet 1:2-4</a>
<dt>hid... until the whole were leavened- 
<dd>During the mystery period, false teaching is stealthily and increasingly mixed with God's Word, until false doctrine and false practice characterize all of Christendom. 
<dd>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the rapid rise of error, large portions of the NT epistles were written to combat heresy and loose living. eg., <a href="1cor5.htm#1">1Cor 5:1-13</a>; <a href="gal5.htm#1">Gal 5:1-9</a>; <a href="1tim4.htm#1">1Tim 4:1-7</a>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many teach that the world will be converted to Christianity and the Church will take dominion over the earth and over all evil before the Lord's return. They would like to identify the Church as 'the Mustard Seed' and as 'the Leaven' that fills the whole world.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Parables #3 and #4, in harmony with the consistent testimony of Scripture, indicate that apostasy will overtake the Church (eg., <a href="luk18.htm#7">Luk 18:7,8</a>; <a href="2tim4.htm#3">2Tim 4:3,4</a>; <a href="2pet2.htm#1">2Pet 2:1-3</a>; <a href="2the2.htm#3">2The 2:3,4</a>). Jesus' interpretation of Parable #2 (the Wheat and the Tares) is consistent with this understanding. After considering His interpretation (below), take time to review Parables #3 and 4, asking Him to give you understanding.
</dl><dt>&nbsp;
<dt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jesus interprets the Parable of the Wheat and the Tares (Parable #2, <a href="mat13.htm#24" target="lwr_lt">v.24-30</a>)-<dt><dt>
<b><i>13:34  All these things spake Jesus unto the multitude in parables; <br>
and without a parable spake he not unto them:<br>
13:35 That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, saying, </b></i>{cp. <a href="psa78.htm#2">Psa 78:2</a>}<i><b><br>
I will open my mouth in parables; <br>
I will utter things which have been kept secret from the foundation of the world.<br>
13:36  Then Jesus sent the multitude away, and went into the house: <br>
and his disciples came unto him, saying, Declare unto us the parable of the tares of the field.</i></b></dt><dl>
<dt>Jesus gave His interpretation to His disciples (ie., to those who would be receptive to His Word).
<dd>But to the multitude of people, who would not receive the truth, He spoke truth in parables so that they would not understand. (As explained in the <a href="mat13an.htm#10" target="lwr_lt">Notes at v.10-17</a>, above.) &nbsp;In v.35, He quotes from Psalm 78, showing (again) that the spiritual blindness of Israel was in fulfillment of prophetic scripture.</dl><dt>
<b><i>13:37  He answered and said unto them, <br>
He that soweth the good seed is the Son of man;<br>
13:38  The field is the world; <br>
the good seed are the children of the kingdom; <br>

<dt><i>The Sower</i> is the Son of man (ie., Christ) (<a href="mat13.htm#37" target="lwr_lt">v.37</a>).
<dd>As we noted in the discussion of the first parable, Christ involves believers in the work of sowing His Word in the world. Notice that 'His field' (<a href="mat13.htm#24" target="lwr_lt">v.24</a>) became corrupted... 
<dt>while <i>men</i> slept... (<a href="mat13.htm#25" target="lwr_lt">v.25</a>)- The Sower is the Lord, who ''neither slumbers nor sleeps'' (<a href="psa121.htm#4">Psa 121:4</a>).
<dd>But men with responsibility to share the Word are often inattentive to the Truth, giving entrance to error. cp. <a href="mat25.htm#5">Mat 25:5</a>; <a href="isa56.htm#10">Isa 56:10</a>; <a href="act20.htm#30">Acts 20:30,31</a>; <a href="2tim4.htm#3">2Tim 4:3-5</a>; <a href="heb12.htm#15">Heb 12:15</a>; <a href="1pet5.htm#8">1Pet 5:8</a>; <a href="eph5.htm#11">Eph 5:11-17</a>
<dt><i>The good seed</i> are 'the children of the kingdom' (<a href="mat13.htm#38" target="lwr_lt">v.38</a>)- 
<dd>In the first parable, <i>the seed</i> is 'the Word of God' (<a href="mat13.htm#19" target="lwr_lt">v.19</a>; <a href="mar4.htm#14">Mark 4:14</a>; <a href="luk8.htm#11">Luk 8:11</a>).
<dd>Here, <i>the good seed</i> are people who have been transformed by the Word of God, which has taken root in receptive hearts. These are 'born again' believers. cp. <a href="1pet1.htm#23">1Pet 1:23</a>; <a href="1joh3.htm#9">1Joh 3:9</a>
<dt><i>The tares</i> are the children of the wicked one-
<dd>tares- GK=zizanium, probably referring specifically to a weed called 'darnel' which is virtually identical in appearance to wheat before the grain heads appear.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Likewise, to human eyes, which look on the outward appearance, the children of the Christ's Kingdom and the children of the devil are nearly indistinguishable. Whenever Jesus spoke of the children of the devil, He was referring to people who were cloked in counterfeit religious activity (rather than overt unbelievers, whose way of life would be expected to differ from that of His people). <a href="joh8.htm#38">Joh 8:38-44</a>; <a href="mat23.htm#15">Mat 23:15</a>
<dt><i>The enemy</i>... is the Devil (<a href="mat13.htm#25" target="lwr_lt">v.25</a>, <a href="mat13.htm#39" target="lwr_lt">v.39</a>)-
<dd>The devil has planted 'professing believers' among the 'true believers.'
<dd>These false believers are - <ul> 
<li>deceiving- They may be outwardly indistinguishable from God's children. <a href="mat13.htm#28" target="lwr_lt">v.28,29</a><dd>
But inwardly, they have not been born of His Spirit. <a href="mat15.htm#7">Mat 15:7,8</a>; <a href="php3.htm#18">Php 3:18,19</a></dd>
<li>deceived- They may consider themselves to be God's children. cp. <a href="mat7.htm#21">Mat 7:21-23</a>; <a href="luk18.htm#10">Luk 18:10-14</a></ul>
<dd><b>The primary point of this parable:</b> The 'mystery' period of the Kingdom is characterized by a mingling of counterfeit believers among the true believers.<br>
<dd><b>A secondary point:</b> Believers are commissioned to proclaim God's Word, which separates truth from error, and which is able to convict and exhort the hearts of men. But God, who alone sees the heart, has neither equipped nor commissioned us to remove professing (false) believers from the congregation of true believers. The danger is that we may inflict damage to an immature believer by identifying him as among the false. (<a href="mat13.htm#27" target="lwr_lt">v.27-30</a>; <a href="rom14.htm#12">Rom 14:12,13</a>) <br>(Yet, separation from those who unrepentently proclaim false teachings and/or who promote ungodly living is both required and enabled by the standard of God's Word. eg., <a href="2cor6.htm#14">2Cor 6:14-18</a>; <a href="rom16.htm#17">Rom 16:17</a>; <a href="php3.htm#17">Php 3:17</a>)<dt>
<dt><i>The harvest</i> (<a href="mat13.htm#30" target="lwr_lt">v.30</a>) is the end of the 'age' (<a href="mat13.htm#39" target="lwr_lt">v.39</a>)- ie., the end of the 'mystery' period of the Kingdom,
<dd>at the time when Christ returns to establish His Kingdom on earth.
<dt><i>The reapers</i> (<a href="mat13.htm#30" target="lwr_lt">v.30</a>) are the angels (<a href="mat13.htm#39" target="lwr_lt">v.39</a>)- cp. <a href="mat24.htm#31">Mat 24:31</a>
<dd>The Lord will commission His angels to do the work of separation... in a specific order -<ol type="1">
<li><i>first</i>, the tares are gathered and bundled for burning (<a href="mat13.htm#30" target="lwr_lt">v.30</a>; <a href="mat13.htm#40" target="lwr_lt">v.40-42</a>).<dd>As Christ begins to establish His Kingdom on earth, the tares and &quot;all things that offend&quot; will be &quot;gathered out of His Kingdom.&quot; With the exception of some notable leaders, the actual burning of the tares does not occur until long after the wheat is gathered into the barn (ie., into the Kingdom). See <a href="mat25.htm#31">Mat 25:31-34,41</a>; <a href="rev19.htm#20">Rev 19:20</a>; <a href="rev20.htm#1">20:1-15</a></dd>
<li><i>then</i>, the wheat is gathered into the Kingdom (<a href="mat13.htm#30" target="lwr_lt">v.30</a>; <a href="mat13.htm#43" target="lwr_lt">v.43</a>). cp. <a href="mat25.htm#34">Mat 25:34</a>; <a href="dan12.htm#3">Dan 12:3</a></ol>
<dd>Note that this order is also reflected in the order of the parables:<ol type="a">
<li>the tares described- Parables #3 (Mustard Seed) and #4 (Leaven)
<li>the wheat described- Parables #5 (the Treasure) and #6 (the Pearl)

<dd>In which category are you? <a href="2cor13.htm#5">2Cor 13:5</a></dl><dt>&nbsp;
<dt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Parable #5- The Hidden Treasure (<a href="mat13.htm#44" target="lwr_lt">v.44</a>)<dt><dt>
<b><i>13:44  Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto treasure hid in a field; <br>

<li>The buyer cannot be a sinner seeking Christ, because-<ol type="a">
<li>The sinner does not buy, but forsakes the world, for Christ.
<li>The sinner has nothing to sell.

<li>Christ is not hidden, and is not to be hidden by the believer. <a href="mar7.htm#24">Mark 7:24</a>; <a href="act4.htm#20">Acts 4:20</a></ol>
<li>The buyer is Christ, who came to seek His lost people.  (<a href="mat13.htm#44" target="lwr_lt">v.44</a>)-<ol type="a">

<li>The price He paid was for the whole world. <a href="1joh2.htm#2">1Joh 2:2</a>
<li>The treasure is Israel, in two aspects-<br>(In the OT, the word 'treasure' is applied specifically to Israel. In the NT, the Church is referred to as the Lord's 'peculiar people,' but the word 'treasure' is not applied to the Church.)<ol type="1">
<li>National Israel, cp. <a href="ex19.htm#5">Ex 19:5</a>; <a href="psa135.htm#4">Psa 135:4</a><br>

- - which will be hidden from total destruction during the Tribulation. <a href="rev12.htm#6">Rev 12:6,14</a>
<li>The believing remnant of Israel ( <a href="rom11.htm#5">Rom 11:5</a> ), who along with believing gentiles (<a href="eph2.htm#14">Eph 2:14-18</a>), are His purchased possession and inheritance (<a href="eph1.htm#14">Eph 1:14,18</a>) and joy (<a href="heb12.htm#2">Heb 12:2</a>).</ol></ol></ol></dl><dt>&nbsp;
<dt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Parable #6- The Pearl of Great Price<dt><dt>
<b><i>13:45  Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto a merchant man, seeking goodly pearls:<br>
13:46  Who, when he had found one pearl of great price, <br>
went and sold all that he had, and bought it.</i></b></dt><dl>
<dt>Again, this is not the sinner seeking Christ.
<dt>The merchant man- is Christ, 
<dd>who gave Himself to redeem and purify a people for Himself. <a href="tit2.htm#14">Titus 2:14</a>; <a href="1pet2.htm#9">1Pet 2:9,10</a>
<dt>the one pearl- is the true Church (ie., the one body consisting of all true believers, <a href="eph1.htm#9">Eph 1:9,10</a>; <a href="eph2.htm#11">2:11-18</a>)-<ol type="a">
<li>As natural pearls are formed by a living process of accretion,<dd>so, Christ adds to His Church. <a href="act2.htm#41">Acts 2:41,47</a>; <a href="act5.htm#14">5:14</a>; <a href="eph2.htm#19">Eph 2:19-22</a>; <a href="eph4.htm#15">4:15,16</a></dd>
<li>As natural pearls are highly valued,<dd>so, Christ paid a &quot;great price... all that He had, and bought&quot; the Church,</dd><dd>which He is preparing for presentation to Himself. <a href="eph5.htm#25">Eph 5:25-27</a>; <a href="1cor6.htm#19">1Cor 6:19,20</a>; <a href="1cor7.htm#23">7:23</a></dd>
<li>As natural pearls come out of the 'sea,'<dd>
so, the Church, which includes the Jewish remnant, is largely composed of gentiles</dd><dd>(those who have been gathered out of the sea of humanity). <a href="eph2.htm#11">Eph 2:11-18</a></dd></ol>
<dd>[notes on v.44-46 adapted from ScofRB]
<dt>Note the order of parables #5 and #6 - The one price (&quot;all that He had&quot;) is applied first for the Treasure, then for the Pearl. Likewise, the gospel of Christ &quot;is the power of God unto salvation to everyone that believeth; to the Jew first, and also to the Greek {ie., Gentile}.&quot; (<a href="rom1.htm#16">Rom 1:16</a>)</dl><dt>&nbsp;
<dt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Parable #7- The Dragnet<dt><dt>
<b><i>13:47  Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto a net, <br>

As shown by <a href="1cor10.htm#32">1Cor 10:32</a>, humanity divides into three categories.<br>The three kinds {GK=genos} of people may all look good to the untrained eye. But apart from the new birth (regeneration), all are 'dead in trespasses and sins' (<a href="rom3.htm#23">Rom 3:23</a>; <a href="eph2.htm#1">Eph 2:1</a>). Thus, the terms 'bad' {ie., 'rotten'} and 'wicked' are apt descriptions of the lost. The saved are 'just' {ie., righteous} through the righteousness of the Savior (<a href="mat13.htm#44" target="lwr_lt">v.44-46</a>; <a href="2cor5.htm#21">2Cor 5:21</a>). He paid the price to transform those, who trust in Him, from 'bad' to 'good.'
