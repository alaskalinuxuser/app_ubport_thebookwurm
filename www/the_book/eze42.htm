Ezekiel  42<br>1. Then he brought me forth into the utter court, the way toward the north: and he brought me into the chamber that [was] over against the separate place, and which [was] before the building toward the north.<br><a name="2">2</a>  Before the length of an hundred cubits [was] the north door, and the breadth [was] fifty cubits.<br><a name="3">3</a>  Over against the twenty [cubits] which [were] for the inner court, and over against the pavement which [was] for the utter court, [was] gallery against gallery in three [stories].<br><a name="4">4</a>  And before the chambers [was] a walk of ten cubits breadth inward, a way of one cubit; and their doors toward the north.<br><a name="5">5</a>  Now the upper chambers [were] shorter: for the galleries were higher than these, than the lower, and than the middlemost of the building.<br><a name="6">6</a>  For they [were] in three [stories], but had not pillars as the pillars of the courts: therefore [the building] was straitened more than the lowest and the middlemost from the ground.<br><a name="7">7</a>  And the wall that [was] without over against the chambers, toward the utter court on the forepart of the chambers, the length thereof [was] fifty cubits.<br><a name="8">8</a>  For the length of the chambers that [were] in the utter court [was] fifty cubits: and, lo, before the temple [were] an hundred cubits.<br><a name="9">9</a>  And from under these chambers [was] the entry on the east side, as one goeth into them from the utter court.<br><a name="10">10</a>  The chambers [were] in the thickness of the wall of the court toward the east, over against the separate place, and over against the building.<br><a name="11">11</a>  And the way before them [was] like the appearance of the chambers which [were] toward the north, as long as they, [and] as broad as they: and all their goings out [were] both according to their fashions, and according to their doors.<br><a name="12">12</a>  And according to the doors of the chambers that [were] toward the south [was] a door in the head of the way, [even] the way directly before the wall toward the east, as one entereth into them.<br><a name="13">13</a>  Then said he unto me, The north chambers [and] the south chambers, which [are] before the separate place, they [be] holy chambers, where the priests that approach unto the LORD shall eat the most holy things: there shall they lay the most holy things, and the meat offering, and the sin offering, and the trespass offering; for the place [is] holy.<br><a name="14">14</a>  When the priests enter therein, then shall they not go out of the holy [place] into the utter court, but there they shall lay their garments wherein they minister; for they [are] holy; and shall put on other garments, and shall approach to [those things] which [are] for the people.<br><a name="15">15</a>. Now when he had made an end of measuring the inner house, he brought me forth toward the gate whose prospect [is] toward the east, and measured it round about.<br><a name="16">16</a>  He measured the east side with the measuring reed, five hundred reeds, with the measuring reed round about.<br><a name="17">17</a>  He measured the north side, five hundred reeds, with the measuring reed round about.<br><a name="18">18</a>  He measured the south side, five hundred reeds, with the measuring reed.<br><a name="19">19</a>  He turned about to the west side, [and] measured five hundred reeds with the measuring reed.<br><a name="20">20</a>  He measured it by the four sides: it had a wall round about, five hundred [reeds] long, and five hundred broad, to make a separation between the sanctuary and the profane place.<br><br>Go to <a href="eze43.htm#1">Ezekiel 43</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
