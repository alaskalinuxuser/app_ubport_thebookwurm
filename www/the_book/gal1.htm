Galatians   1<br>1. Paul, an apostle, (not of men, neither by man, but by Jesus Christ, and God the Father, who raised him from the dead;)<br><a name="2">2</a>  And all the brethren which are with me, unto the churches of Galatia:<br><a name="3">3</a>  Grace [be] to you and peace from God the Father, and [from] our Lord Jesus Christ,<br><a name="4">4</a>  Who gave himself for our sins, that he might deliver us from this present evil world, according to the will of God and our Father:<br><a name="5">5</a>  To whom [be] glory for ever and ever. Amen.<br><a name="6">6</a>. I marvel that ye are so soon removed from him that called you into the grace of Christ unto another gospel:<br><a name="7">7</a>  Which is not another; but there be some that trouble you, and would pervert the gospel of Christ.<br><a name="8">8</a>  But though we, or an angel from heaven, preach any other gospel unto you than that which we have preached unto you, let him be accursed.<br><a name="9">9</a>  As we said before, so say I now again, If any [man] preach any other gospel unto you than that ye have received, let him be accursed.<br><a name="10">10</a>. For do I now persuade men, or God? or do I seek to please men? for if I yet pleased men, I should not be the servant of Christ.<br><a name="11">11</a>  But I certify you, brethren, that the gospel which was preached of me is not after man.<br><a name="12">12</a>  For I neither received it of man, neither was I taught [it], but by the revelation of Jesus Christ.<br><a name="13">13</a>  For ye have heard of my conversation in time past in the Jews' religion, how that beyond measure I persecuted the church of God, and wasted it:<br><a name="14">14</a>  And profited in the Jews' religion above many my equals in mine own nation, being more exceedingly zealous of the traditions of my fathers.<br><a name="15">15</a>  But when it pleased God, who separated me from my mother's womb, and called [me] by his grace,<br><a name="16">16</a>  To reveal his Son in me, that I might preach him among the heathen; immediately I conferred not with flesh and blood:<br><a name="17">17</a>  Neither went I up to Jerusalem to them which were apostles before me; but I went into Arabia, and returned again unto Damascus.<br><a name="18">18</a>  Then after three years I went up to Jerusalem to see Peter, and abode with him fifteen days.<br><a name="19">19</a>  But other of the apostles saw I none, save James the Lord's brother.<br><a name="20">20</a>  Now the things which I write unto you, behold, before God, I lie not.<br><a name="21">21</a>  Afterwards I came into the regions of Syria and Cilicia;<br><a name="22">22</a>  And was unknown by face unto the churches of Judaea which were in Christ:<br><a name="23">23</a>  But they had heard only, That he which persecuted us in times past now preacheth the faith which once he destroyed.<br><a name="24">24</a>  And they glorified God in me.<br><br>Go to <a href="gal2.htm#1">Galatians 2</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
