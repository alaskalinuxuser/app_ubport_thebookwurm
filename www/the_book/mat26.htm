Matthew  26<br> 1. And it came to pass, when Jesus had finished all these sayings, he said unto his disciples,<br><a name="2">2</a>  Ye know that after two days is [the feast of] the passover, and the Son of man is betrayed to be crucified.<br><a name="3">3</a>  Then assembled together the chief priests, and the scribes, and the elders of the people, unto the palace of the high priest, who was called Caiaphas,<br><a name="4">4</a>  And consulted that they might take Jesus by subtilty, and kill [him].<br><a name="5">5</a>  But they said, Not on the feast [day], lest there be an uproar among the people.<br><a name="6">6</a>. Now when Jesus was in Bethany, in the house of Simon the leper,<br><a name="7">7</a>  There came unto him a woman having an alabaster box of very precious ointment, and poured it on his head, as he sat [at meat].<br><a name="8">8</a>  But when his disciples saw [it], they had indignation, saying, To what purpose [is] this waste?<br><a name="9">9</a>  For this ointment might have been sold for much, and given to the poor.<br><a name="10">10</a>  When Jesus understood [it], he said unto them, Why trouble ye the woman? for she hath wrought a good work upon me.<br><a name="11">11</a>  For ye have the poor always with you; but me ye have not always.<br><a name="12">12</a>  For in that she hath poured this ointment on my body, she did [it] for my burial.<br><a name="13">13</a>  Verily I say unto you, Wheresoever this gospel shall be preached in the whole world, [there] shall also this, that this woman hath done, be told for a memorial of her.<br><a name="14">14</a>. Then one of the twelve, called Judas Iscariot, went unto the chief priests,<br><a name="15">15</a>  And said [unto them], What will ye give me, and I will deliver him unto you? And they covenanted with him for thirty pieces of silver.<br><a name="16">16</a>  And from that time he sought opportunity to betray him.<br><a name="17">17</a>. Now the first [day] of the [feast of] unleavened bread the disciples came to Jesus, saying unto him, Where wilt thou that we prepare for thee to eat the passover?<br><a name="18">18</a>  And he said, Go into the city to such a man, and say unto him, The Master saith, My time is at hand; I will keep the passover at thy house with my disciples.<br><a name="19">19</a>  And the disciples did as Jesus had appointed them; and they made ready the passover.<br><a name="20">20</a>  Now when the even was come, he sat down with the twelve.<br><a name="21">21</a>  And as they did eat, he said, Verily I say unto you, that one of you shall betray me.<br><a name="22">22</a>  And they were exceeding sorrowful, and began every one of them to say unto him, Lord, is it I?<br><a name="23">23</a>  And he answered and said, He that dippeth [his] hand with me in the dish, the same shall betray me.<br><a name="24">24</a>  The Son of man goeth as it is written of him: but woe unto that man by whom the Son of man is betrayed! it had been good for that man if he had not been born.<br><a name="25">25</a>  Then Judas, which betrayed him, answered and said, Master, is it I? He said unto him, Thou hast said.<br><a name="26">26</a>. And as they were eating, Jesus took bread, and blessed [it], and brake [it], and gave [it] to the disciples, and said, Take, eat; this is my body.<br><a name="27">27</a>  And he took the cup, and gave thanks, and gave [it] to them, saying, Drink ye all of it;<br><a name="28">28</a>  For this is my blood of the new testament, which is shed for many for the remission of sins.<br><a name="29">29</a>  But I say unto you, I will not drink henceforth of this fruit of the vine, until that day when I drink it new with you in my Father's kingdom.<br><a name="30">30</a>  And when they had sung an hymn, they went out into the mount of Olives.<br><a name="31">31</a>. Then saith Jesus unto them, All ye shall be offended because of me this night: for it is written, I will smite the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock shall be scattered abroad.<br><a name="32">32</a>  But after I am risen again, I will go before you into Galilee.<br><a name="33">33</a>  Peter answered and said unto him, Though all [men] shall be offended because of thee, [yet] will I never be offended.<br><a name="34">34</a>  Jesus said unto him, Verily I say unto thee, That this night, before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice.<br><a name="35">35</a>  Peter said unto him, Though I should die with thee, yet will I not deny thee. Likewise also said all the disciples.<br><a name="36">36</a>. Then cometh Jesus with them unto a place called Gethsemane, and saith unto the disciples, Sit ye here, while I go and pray yonder.<br><a name="37">37</a>  And he took with him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, and began to be sorrowful and very heavy.<br><a name="38">38</a>  Then saith he unto them, My soul is exceeding sorrowful, even unto death: tarry ye here, and watch with me.<br><a name="39">39</a>  And he went a little further, and fell on his face, and prayed, saying, O my Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me: nevertheless not as I will, but as thou [wilt].<br><a name="40">40</a>  And he cometh unto the disciples, and findeth them asleep, and saith unto Peter, What, could ye not watch with me one hour?<br><a name="41">41</a>  Watch and pray, that ye enter not into temptation: the spirit indeed [is] willing, but the flesh [is] weak.<br><a name="42">42</a>  He went away again the second time, and prayed, saying, O my Father, if this cup may not pass away from me, except I drink it, thy will be done.<br><a name="43">43</a>  And he came and found them asleep again: for their eyes were heavy.<br><a name="44">44</a>  And he left them, and went away again, and prayed the third time, saying the same words.<br><a name="45">45</a>  Then cometh he to his disciples, and saith unto them, Sleep on now, and take [your] rest: behold, the hour is at hand, and the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners.<br><a name="46">46</a>  Rise, let us be going: behold, he is at hand that doth betray me.<br><a name="47">47</a>. And while he yet spake, lo, Judas, one of the twelve, came, and with him a great multitude with swords and staves, from the chief priests and elders of the people.<br><a name="48">48</a>  Now he that betrayed him gave them a sign, saying, Whomsoever I shall kiss, that same is he: hold him fast.<br><a name="49">49</a>  And forthwith he came to Jesus, and said, Hail, master; and kissed him.<br><a name="50">50</a>  And Jesus said unto him, Friend, wherefore art thou come? Then came they, and laid hands on Jesus, and took him.<br><a name="51">51</a>  And, behold, one of them which were with Jesus stretched out [his] hand, and drew his sword, and struck a servant of the high priest's, and smote off his ear.<br><a name="52">52</a>  Then said Jesus unto him, Put up again thy sword into his place: for all they that take the sword shall perish with the sword.<br><a name="53">53</a>  Thinkest thou that I cannot now pray to my Father, and he shall presently give me more than twelve legions of angels?<br><a name="54">54</a>  But how then shall the scriptures be fulfilled, that thus it must be?<br><a name="55">55</a>  In that same hour said Jesus to the multitudes, Are ye come out as against a thief with swords and staves for to take me? I sat daily with you teaching in the temple, and ye laid no hold on me.<br><a name="56">56</a>  But all this was done, that the scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled. Then all the disciples forsook him, and fled.<br><a name="57">57</a>. And they that had laid hold on Jesus led [him] away to Caiaphas the high priest, where the scribes and the elders were assembled.<br><a name="58">58</a>  But Peter followed him afar off unto the high priest's palace, and went in, and sat with the servants, to see the end.<br><a name="59">59</a>  Now the chief priests, and elders, and all the council, sought false witness against Jesus, to put him to death;<br><a name="60">60</a>  But found none: yea, though many false witnesses came, [yet] found they none. At the last came two false witnesses,<br><a name="61">61</a>  And said, This [fellow] said, I am able to destroy the temple of God, and to build it in three days.<br><a name="62">62</a>  And the high priest arose, and said unto him, Answerest thou nothing? what [is it which] these witness against thee?<br><a name="63">63</a>  But Jesus held his peace. And the high priest answered and said unto him, I adjure thee by the living God, that thou tell us whether thou be the Christ, the Son of God.<br><a name="64">64</a>  Jesus saith unto him, Thou hast said: nevertheless I say unto you, Hereafter shall ye see the Son of man sitting on the right hand of power, and coming in the clouds of heaven.<br><a name="65">65</a>  Then the high priest rent his clothes, saying, He hath spoken blasphemy; what further need have we of witnesses? behold, now ye have heard his blasphemy.<br><a name="66">66</a>  What think ye? They answered and said, He is guilty of death.<br><a name="67">67</a>  Then did they spit in his face, and buffeted him; and others smote [him] with the palms of their hands,<br><a name="68">68</a>  Saying, Prophesy unto us, thou Christ, Who is he that smote thee?<br><a name="69">69</a>. Now Peter sat without in the palace: and a damsel came unto him, saying, Thou also wast with Jesus of Galilee.<br><a name="70">70</a>  But he denied before [them] all, saying, I know not what thou sayest.<br><a name="71">71</a>  And when he was gone out into the porch, another [maid] saw him, and said unto them that were there, This [fellow] was also with Jesus of Nazareth.<br><a name="72">72</a>  And again he denied with an oath, I do not know the man.<br><a name="73">73</a>  And after a while came unto [him] they that stood by, and said to Peter, Surely thou also art [one] of them; for thy speech bewrayeth thee.<br><a name="74">74</a>  Then began he to curse and to swear, [saying], I know not the man. And immediately the cock crew.<br><a name="75">75</a>  And Peter remembered the word of Jesus, which said unto him, Before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice. And he went out, and wept bitterly.<br><br>Go to <a href="mat27.htm#1">Matthew 27</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
