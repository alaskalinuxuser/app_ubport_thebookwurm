Numbers  13<br>1. And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,<br><a name="2">2</a>  Send thou men, that they may search the land of Canaan, which I give unto the children of Israel: of every tribe of their fathers shall ye send a man, every one a ruler among them.<br><a name="3">3</a>  And Moses by the commandment of the LORD sent them from the wilderness of Paran: all those men [were] heads of the children of Israel.<br><a name="4">4</a>  And these [were] their names: of the tribe of Reuben, Shammua the son of Zaccur.<br><a name="5">5</a>  Of the tribe of Simeon, Shaphat the son of Hori.<br><a name="6">6</a>  Of the tribe of Judah, Caleb the son of Jephunneh.<br><a name="7">7</a>  Of the tribe of Issachar, Igal the son of Joseph.<br><a name="8">8</a>  Of the tribe of Ephraim, Oshea the son of Nun.<br><a name="9">9</a>  Of the tribe of Benjamin, Palti the son of Raphu.<br><a name="10">10</a>  Of the tribe of Zebulun, Gaddiel the son of Sodi.<br><a name="11">11</a>  Of the tribe of Joseph, [namely], of the tribe of Manasseh, Gaddi the son of Susi.<br><a name="12">12</a>  Of the tribe of Dan, Ammiel the son of Gemalli.<br><a name="13">13</a>  Of the tribe of Asher, Sethur the son of Michael.<br><a name="14">14</a>  Of the tribe of Naphtali, Nahbi the son of Vophsi.<br><a name="15">15</a>  Of the tribe of Gad, Geuel the son of Machi.<br><a name="16">16</a>  These [are] the names of the men which Moses sent to spy out the land. And Moses called Oshea the son of Nun Jehoshua.<br><a name="17">17</a>  And Moses sent them to spy out the land of Canaan, and said unto them, Get you up this [way] southward, and go up into the mountain:<br><a name="18">18</a>  And see the land, what it [is]; and the people that dwelleth therein, whether they [be] strong or weak, few or many;<br><a name="19">19</a>  And what the land [is] that they dwell in, whether it [be] good or bad; and what cities [they be] that they dwell in, whether in tents, or in strong holds;<br><a name="20">20</a>  And what the land [is], whether it [be] fat or lean, whether there be wood therein, or not. And be ye of good courage, and bring of the fruit of the land. Now the time [was] the time of the firstripe grapes.<br><a name="21">21</a>. So they went up, and searched the land from the wilderness of Zin unto Rehob, as men come to Hamath.<br><a name="22">22</a>  And they ascended by the south, and came unto Hebron; where Ahiman, Sheshai, and Talmai, the children of Anak, [were]. (Now Hebron was built seven years before Zoan in Egypt.)<br><a name="23">23</a>  And they came unto the brook of Eshcol, and cut down from thence a branch with one cluster of grapes, and they bare it between two upon a staff; and [they brought] of the pomegranates, and of the figs.<br><a name="24">24</a>  The place was called the brook Eshcol, because of the cluster of grapes which the children of Israel cut down from thence.<br><a name="25">25</a>  And they returned from searching of the land after forty days.<br><a name="26">26</a>. And they went and came to Moses, and to Aaron, and to all the congregation of the children of Israel, unto the wilderness of Paran, to Kadesh; and brought back word unto them, and unto all the congregation, and shewed them the fruit of the land.<br><a name="27">27</a>  And they told him, and said, We came unto the land whither thou sentest us, and surely it floweth with milk and honey; and this [is] the fruit of it.<br><a name="28">28</a>  Nevertheless the people [be] strong that dwell in the land, and the cities [are] walled, [and] very great: and moreover we saw the children of Anak there.<br><a name="29">29</a>  The Amalekites dwell in the land of the south: and the Hittites, and the Jebusites, and the Amorites, dwell in the mountains: and the Canaanites dwell by the sea, and by the coast of Jordan.<br><a name="30">30</a>  And Caleb stilled the people before Moses, and said, Let us go up at once, and possess it; for we are well able to overcome it.<br><a name="31">31</a>  But the men that went up with him said, We be not able to go up against the people; for they [are] stronger than we.<br><a name="32">32</a>  And they brought up an evil report of the land which they had searched unto the children of Israel, saying, The land, through which we have gone to search it, [is] a land that eateth up the inhabitants thereof; and all the people that we saw in it [are] men of a great stature.<br><a name="33">33</a>  And there we saw the giants, the sons of Anak, [which come] of the giants: and we were in our own sight as grasshoppers, and so we were in their sight.<br><br>Go to <a href="num14.htm#1">Numbers 14</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
