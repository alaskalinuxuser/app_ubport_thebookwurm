Daniel   8<br> 1. In the third year of the reign of king Belshazzar a vision appeared unto me, [even unto] me Daniel, after that which appeared unto me at the first.<br><a name="2">2</a>  And I saw in a vision; and it came to pass, when I saw, that I [was] at Shushan [in] the palace, which [is] in the province of Elam; and I saw in a vision, and I was by the river of Ulai.<br><a name="3">3</a>  Then I lifted up mine eyes, and saw, and, behold, there stood before the river a ram which had [two] horns: and the [two] horns [were] high; but one [was] higher than the other, and the higher came up last.<br><a name="4">4</a>  I saw the ram pushing westward, and northward, and southward; so that no beasts might stand before him, neither [was there any] that could deliver out of his hand; but he did according to his will, and became great.<br><a name="5">5</a>  And as I was considering, behold, an he goat came from the west on the face of the whole earth, and touched not the ground: and the goat [had] a notable horn between his eyes.<br><a name="6">6</a>  And he came to the ram that had [two] horns, which I had seen standing before the river, and ran unto him in the fury of his power.<br><a name="7">7</a>  And I saw him come close unto the ram, and he was moved with choler against him, and smote the ram, and brake his two horns: and there was no power in the ram to stand before him, but he cast him down to the ground, and stamped upon him: and there was none that could deliver the ram out of his hand.<br><a name="8">8</a>  Therefore the he goat waxed very great: and when he was strong, the great horn was broken; and for it came up four notable ones toward the four winds of heaven.<br><a name="9">9</a>  And out of one of them came forth a little horn, which waxed exceeding great, toward the south, and toward the east, and toward the pleasant [land].<br><a name="10">10</a>  And it waxed great, [even] to the host of heaven; and it cast down [some] of the host and of the stars to the ground, and stamped upon them.<br><a name="11">11</a>  Yea, he magnified [himself] even to the prince of the host, and by him the daily [sacrifice] was taken away, and the place of his sanctuary was cast down.<br><a name="12">12</a>  And an host was given [him] against the daily [sacrifice] by reason of transgression, and it cast down the truth to the ground; and it practised, and prospered.<br><a name="13">13</a>  Then I heard one saint speaking, and another saint said unto that certain [saint] which spake, How long [shall be] the vision [concerning] the daily [sacrifice], and the transgression of desolation, to give both the sanctuary and the host to be trodden under foot?<br><a name="14">14</a>  And he said unto me, Unto two thousand and three hundred days; then shall the sanctuary be cleansed.<br><a name="15">15</a>. And it came to pass, when I, [even] I Daniel, had seen the vision, and sought for the meaning, then, behold, there stood before me as the appearance of a man.<br><a name="16">16</a>  And I heard a man's voice between [the banks of] Ulai, which called, and said, Gabriel, make this [man] to understand the vision.<br><a name="17">17</a>  So he came near where I stood: and when he came, I was afraid, and fell upon my face: but he said unto me, Understand, O son of man: for at the time of the end [shall be] the vision.<br><a name="18">18</a>  Now as he was speaking with me, I was in a deep sleep on my face toward the ground: but he touched me, and set me upright.<br><a name="19">19</a>  And he said, Behold, I will make thee know what shall be in the last end of the indignation: for at the time appointed the end [shall be].<br><a name="20">20</a>  The ram which thou sawest having [two] horns [are] the kings of Media and Persia.<br><a name="21">21</a>  And the rough goat [is] the king of Grecia: and the great horn that [is] between his eyes [is] the first king.<br><a name="22">22</a>  Now that being broken, whereas four stood up for it, four kingdoms shall stand up out of the nation, but not in his power.<br><a name="23">23</a>  And in the latter time of their kingdom, when the transgressors are come to the full, a king of fierce countenance, and understanding dark sentences, shall stand up.<br><a name="24">24</a>  And his power shall be mighty, but not by his own power: and he shall destroy wonderfully, and shall prosper, and practise, and shall destroy the mighty and the holy people.<br><a name="25">25</a>  And through his policy also he shall cause craft to prosper in his hand; and he shall magnify [himself] in his heart, and by peace shall destroy many: he shall also stand up against the Prince of princes; but he shall be broken without hand.<br><a name="26">26</a>  And the vision of the evening and the morning which was told [is] true: wherefore shut thou up the vision; for it [shall be] for many days.<br><a name="27">27</a>  And I Daniel fainted, and was sick [certain] days; afterward I rose up, and did the king's business; and I was astonished at the vision, but none understood [it].<br><br>Go to <a href="dan9.htm#1">Daniel 9</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
