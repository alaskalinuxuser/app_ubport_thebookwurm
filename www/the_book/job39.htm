Job  39<br>1. Knowest thou the time when the wild goats of the rock bring forth? [or] canst thou mark when the hinds do calve?<br><a name="2">2</a>  Canst thou number the months [that] they fulfil? or knowest thou the time when they bring forth?<br><a name="3">3</a>  They bow themselves, they bring forth their young ones, they cast out their sorrows.<br><a name="4">4</a>  Their young ones are in good liking, they grow up with corn; they go forth, and return not unto them.<br><a name="5">5</a>  Who hath sent out the wild ass free? or who hath loosed the bands of the wild ass?<br><a name="6">6</a>  Whose house I have made the wilderness, and the barren land his dwellings.<br><a name="7">7</a>  He scorneth the multitude of the city, neither regardeth he the crying of the driver.<br><a name="8">8</a>  The range of the mountains [is] his pasture, and he searcheth after every green thing.<br><a name="9">9</a>  Will the unicorn be willing to serve thee, or abide by thy crib?<br><a name="10">10</a>  Canst thou bind the unicorn with his band in the furrow? or will he harrow the valleys after thee?<br><a name="11">11</a>  Wilt thou trust him, because his strength [is] great? or wilt thou leave thy labour to him?<br><a name="12">12</a>  Wilt thou believe him, that he will bring home thy seed, and gather [it into] thy barn?<br><a name="13">13</a>. [Gavest thou] the goodly wings unto the peacocks? or wings and feathers unto the ostrich?<br><a name="14">14</a>  Which leaveth her eggs in the earth, and warmeth them in dust,<br><a name="15">15</a>  And forgetteth that the foot may crush them, or that the wild beast may break them.<br><a name="16">16</a>  She is hardened against her young ones, as though [they were] not hers: her labour is in vain without fear;<br><a name="17">17</a>  Because God hath deprived her of wisdom, neither hath he imparted to her understanding.<br><a name="18">18</a>  What time she lifteth up herself on high, she scorneth the horse and his rider.<br><a name="19">19</a>. Hast thou given the horse strength? hast thou clothed his neck with thunder?<br><a name="20">20</a>  Canst thou make him afraid as a grasshopper? the glory of his nostrils [is] terrible.<br><a name="21">21</a>  He paweth in the valley, and rejoiceth in [his] strength: he goeth on to meet the armed men.<br><a name="22">22</a>  He mocketh at fear, and is not affrighted; neither turneth he back from the sword.<br><a name="23">23</a>  The quiver rattleth against him, the glittering spear and the shield.<br><a name="24">24</a>  He swalloweth the ground with fierceness and rage: neither believeth he that [it is] the sound of the trumpet.<br><a name="25">25</a>  He saith among the trumpets, Ha, ha; and he smelleth the battle afar off, the thunder of the captains, and the shouting.<br><a name="26">26</a>. Doth the hawk fly by thy wisdom, [and] stretch her wings toward the south?<br><a name="27">27</a>  Doth the eagle mount up at thy command, and make her nest on high?<br><a name="28">28</a>  She dwelleth and abideth on the rock, upon the crag of the rock, and the strong place.<br><a name="29">29</a>  From thence she seeketh the prey, [and] her eyes behold afar off.<br><a name="30">30</a>  Her young ones also suck up blood: and where the slain [are], there [is] she.<br><br>Go to <a href="job40.htm#1">Job 40</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
