Job   6<br>1. But Job answered and said,<br><a name="2">2</a>  Oh that my grief were throughly weighed, and my calamity laid in the balances together!<br><a name="3">3</a>  For now it would be heavier than the sand of the sea: therefore my words are swallowed up.<br><a name="4">4</a>  For the arrows of the Almighty [are] within me, the poison whereof drinketh up my spirit: the terrors of God do set themselves in array against me.<br><a name="5">5</a>  Doth the wild ass bray when he hath grass? or loweth the ox over his fodder?<br><a name="6">6</a>  Can that which is unsavoury be eaten without salt? or is there [any] taste in the white of an egg?<br><a name="7">7</a>  The things [that] my soul refused to touch [are] as my sorrowful meat.<br><a name="8">8</a>. Oh that I might have my request; and that God would grant [me] the thing that I long for!<br><a name="9">9</a>  Even that it would please God to destroy me; that he would let loose his hand, and cut me off!<br><a name="10">10</a>  Then should I yet have comfort; yea, I would harden myself in sorrow: let him not spare; for I have not concealed the words of the Holy One.<br><a name="11">11</a>  What [is] my strength, that I should hope? and what [is] mine end, that I should prolong my life?<br><a name="12">12</a>  [Is] my strength the strength of stones? or [is] my flesh of brass?<br><a name="13">13</a>  [Is] not my help in me? and is wisdom driven quite from me?<br><a name="14">14</a>. To him that is afflicted pity [should be shewed] from his friend; but he forsaketh the fear of the Almighty.<br><a name="15">15</a>  My brethren have dealt deceitfully as a brook, [and] as the stream of brooks they pass away;<br><a name="16">16</a>  Which are blackish by reason of the ice, [and] wherein the snow is hid:<br><a name="17">17</a>  What time they wax warm, they vanish: when it is hot, they are consumed out of their place.<br><a name="18">18</a>  The paths of their way are turned aside; they go to nothing, and perish.<br><a name="19">19</a>  The troops of Tema looked, the companies of Sheba waited for them.<br><a name="20">20</a>  They were confounded because they had hoped; they came thither, and were ashamed.<br><a name="21">21</a>  For now ye are nothing; ye see [my] casting down, and are afraid.<br><a name="22">22</a>. Did I say, Bring unto me? or, Give a reward for me of your substance?<br><a name="23">23</a>  Or, Deliver me from the enemy's hand? or, Redeem me from the hand of the mighty?<br><a name="24">24</a>  Teach me, and I will hold my tongue: and cause me to understand wherein I have erred.<br><a name="25">25</a>  How forcible are right words! but what doth your arguing reprove?<br><a name="26">26</a>  Do ye imagine to reprove words, and the speeches of one that is desperate, [which are] as wind?<br><a name="27">27</a>  Yea, ye overwhelm the fatherless, and ye dig [a pit] for your friend.<br><a name="28">28</a>  Now therefore be content, look upon me; for [it is] evident unto you if I lie.<br><a name="29">29</a>  Return, I pray you, let it not be iniquity; yea, return again, my righteousness [is] in it.<br><a name="30">30</a>  Is there iniquity in my tongue? cannot my taste discern perverse things?<br><br>Go to <a href="job7.htm#1">Job 7</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
