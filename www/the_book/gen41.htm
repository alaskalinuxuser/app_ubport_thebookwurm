Genesis  41<br>1. And it came to pass at the end of two full years, that Pharaoh dreamed: and, behold, he stood by the river.<br><a name="2">2</a>  And, behold, there came up out of the river seven well favoured kine and fatfleshed; and they fed in a meadow.<br><a name="3">3</a>  And, behold, seven other kine came up after them out of the river, ill favoured and leanfleshed; and stood by the [other] kine upon the brink of the river.<br><a name="4">4</a>  And the ill favoured and leanfleshed kine did eat up the seven well favoured and fat kine. So Pharaoh awoke.<br><a name="5">5</a>  And he slept and dreamed the second time: and, behold, seven ears of corn came up upon one stalk, rank and good.<br><a name="6">6</a>  And, behold, seven thin ears and blasted with the east wind sprung up after them.<br><a name="7">7</a>  And the seven thin ears devoured the seven rank and full ears. And Pharaoh awoke, and, behold, [it was] a dream.<br><a name="8">8</a>  And it came to pass in the morning that his spirit was troubled; and he sent and called for all the magicians of Egypt, and all the wise men thereof: and Pharaoh told them his dream; but [there was] none that could interpret them unto Pharaoh.<br><a name="9">9</a>. Then spake the chief butler unto Pharaoh, saying, I do remember my faults this day:<br><a name="10">10</a>  Pharaoh was wroth with his servants, and put me in ward in the captain of the guard's house, [both] me and the chief baker:<br><a name="11">11</a>  And we dreamed a dream in one night, I and he; we dreamed each man according to the interpretation of his dream.<br><a name="12">12</a>  And [there was] there with us a young man, an Hebrew, servant to the captain of the guard; and we told him, and he interpreted to us our dreams; to each man according to his dream he did interpret.<br><a name="13">13</a>  And it came to pass, as he interpreted to us, so it was; me he restored unto mine office, and him he hanged.<br><a name="14">14</a>  Then Pharaoh sent and called Joseph, and they brought him hastily out of the dungeon: and he shaved [himself], and changed his raiment, and came in unto Pharaoh.<br><a name="15">15</a>  And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, I have dreamed a dream, and [there is] none that can interpret it: and I have heard say of thee, [that] thou canst understand a dream to interpret it.<br><a name="16">16</a>  And Joseph answered Pharaoh, saying, [It is] not in me: God shall give Pharaoh an answer of peace.<br><a name="17">17</a>. And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, In my dream, behold, I stood upon the bank of the river:<br><a name="18">18</a>  And, behold, there came up out of the river seven kine, fatfleshed and well favoured; and they fed in a meadow:<br><a name="19">19</a>  And, behold, seven other kine came up after them, poor and very ill favoured and leanfleshed, such as I never saw in all the land of Egypt for badness:<br><a name="20">20</a>  And the lean and the ill favoured kine did eat up the first seven fat kine:<br><a name="21">21</a>  And when they had eaten them up, it could not be known that they had eaten them; but they [were] still ill favoured, as at the beginning. So I awoke.<br><a name="22">22</a>  And I saw in my dream, and, behold, seven ears came up in one stalk, full and good:<br><a name="23">23</a>  And, behold, seven ears, withered, thin, [and] blasted with the east wind, sprung up after them:<br><a name="24">24</a>  And the thin ears devoured the seven good ears: and I told [this] unto the magicians; but [there was] none that could declare [it] to me.<br><a name="25">25</a>  And Joseph said unto Pharaoh, The dream of Pharaoh [is] one: God hath shewed Pharaoh what he [is] about to do.<br><a name="26">26</a>  The seven good kine [are] seven years; and the seven good ears [are] seven years: the dream [is] one.<br><a name="27">27</a>  And the seven thin and ill favoured kine that came up after them [are] seven years; and the seven empty ears blasted with the east wind shall be seven years of famine.<br><a name="28">28</a>  This [is] the thing which I have spoken unto Pharaoh: What God [is] about to do he sheweth unto Pharaoh.<br><a name="29">29</a>  Behold, there come seven years of great plenty throughout all the land of Egypt:<br><a name="30">30</a>  And there shall arise after them seven years of famine; and all the plenty shall be forgotten in the land of Egypt; and the famine shall consume the land;<br><a name="31">31</a>  And the plenty shall not be known in the land by reason of that famine following; for it [shall be] very grievous.<br><a name="32">32</a>  And for that the dream was doubled unto Pharaoh twice; [it is] because the thing [is] established by God, and God will shortly bring it to pass.<br><a name="33">33</a>. Now therefore let Pharaoh look out a man discreet and wise, and set him over the land of Egypt.<br><a name="34">34</a>  Let Pharaoh do [this], and let him appoint officers over the land, and take up the fifth part of the land of Egypt in the seven plenteous years.<br><a name="35">35</a>  And let them gather all the food of those good years that come, and lay up corn under the hand of Pharaoh, and let them keep food in the cities.<br><a name="36">36</a>  And that food shall be for store to the land against the seven years of famine, which shall be in the land of Egypt; that the land perish not through the famine.<br><a name="37">37</a>  And the thing was good in the eyes of Pharaoh, and in the eyes of all his servants.<br><a name="38">38</a>  And Pharaoh said unto his servants, Can we find [such a one] as this [is], a man in whom the Spirit of God [is]?<br><a name="39">39</a>  And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, Forasmuch as God hath shewed thee all this, [there is] none so discreet and wise as thou [art]:<br><a name="40">40</a>  Thou shalt be over my house, and according unto thy word shall all my people be ruled: only in the throne will I be greater than thou.<br><a name="41">41</a>  And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, See, I have set thee over all the land of Egypt.<br><a name="42">42</a>  And Pharaoh took off his ring from his hand, and put it upon Joseph's hand, and arrayed him in vestures of fine linen, and put a gold chain about his neck;<br><a name="43">43</a>  And he made him to ride in the second chariot which he had; and they cried before him, Bow the knee: and he made him [ruler] over all the land of Egypt.<br><a name="44">44</a>  And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, I [am] Pharaoh, and without thee shall no man lift up his hand or foot in all the land of Egypt.<br><a name="45">45</a>  And Pharaoh called Joseph's name Zaphnathpaaneah; and he gave him to wife Asenath the daughter of Potipherah priest of On. And Joseph went out over [all] the land of Egypt.<br><a name="46">46</a>. And Joseph [was] thirty years old when he stood before Pharaoh king of Egypt. And Joseph went out from the presence of Pharaoh, and went throughout all the land of Egypt.<br><a name="47">47</a>  And in the seven plenteous years the earth brought forth by handfuls.<br><a name="48">48</a>  And he gathered up all the food of the seven years, which were in the land of Egypt, and laid up the food in the cities: the food of the field, which [was] round about every city, laid he up in the same.<br><a name="49">49</a>  And Joseph gathered corn as the sand of the sea, very much, until he left numbering; for [it was] without number.<br><a name="50">50</a>  And unto Joseph were born two sons before the years of famine came, which Asenath the daughter of Potipherah priest of On bare unto him.<br><a name="51">51</a>  And Joseph called the name of the firstborn Manasseh: For God, [said he], hath made me forget all my toil, and all my father's house.<br><a name="52">52</a>  And the name of the second called he Ephraim: For God hath caused me to be fruitful in the land of my affliction.<br><a name="53">53</a>  And the seven years of plenteousness, that was in the land of Egypt, were ended.<br><a name="54">54</a>  And the seven years of dearth began to come, according as Joseph had said: and the dearth was in all lands; but in all the land of Egypt there was bread.<br><a name="55">55</a>  And when all the land of Egypt was famished, the people cried to Pharaoh for bread: and Pharaoh said unto all the Egyptians, Go unto Joseph; what he saith to you, do.<br><a name="56">56</a>  And the famine was over all the face of the earth: And Joseph opened all the storehouses, and sold unto the Egyptians; and the famine waxed sore in the land of Egypt.<br><a name="57">57</a>  And all countries came into Egypt to Joseph for to buy [corn]; because that the famine was [so] sore in all lands.<br><br>Go to <a href="gen42.htm#1">Genesis 42</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
