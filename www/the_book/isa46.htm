Isaiah  46<br>1. Bel boweth down, Nebo stoopeth, their idols were upon the beasts, and upon the cattle: your carriages [were] heavy loaden; [they are] a burden to the weary [beast].<br><a name="2">2</a>  They stoop, they bow down together; they could not deliver the burden, but themselves are gone into captivity.<br><a name="3">3</a>  Hearken unto me, O house of Jacob, and all the remnant of the house of Israel, which are borne [by me] from the belly, which are carried from the womb:<br><a name="4">4</a>  And [even] to [your] old age I [am] he; and [even] to hoar hairs will I carry [you]: I have made, and I will bear; even I will carry, and will deliver [you].<br><a name="5">5</a>. To whom will ye liken me, and make [me] equal, and compare me, that we may be like?<br><a name="6">6</a>  They lavish gold out of the bag, and weigh silver in the balance, [and] hire a goldsmith; and he maketh it a god: they fall down, yea, they worship.<br><a name="7">7</a>  They bear him upon the shoulder, they carry him, and set him in his place, and he standeth; from his place shall he not remove: yea, [one] shall cry unto him, yet can he not answer, nor save him out of his trouble.<br><a name="8">8</a>  Remember this, and shew yourselves men: bring [it] again to mind, O ye transgressors.<br><a name="9">9</a>  Remember the former things of old: for I [am] God, and [there is] none else; [I am] God, and [there is] none like me,<br><a name="10">10</a>  Declaring the end from the beginning, and from ancient times [the things] that are not [yet] done, saying, My counsel shall stand, and I will do all my pleasure:<br><a name="11">11</a>  Calling a ravenous bird from the east, the man that executeth my counsel from a far country: yea, I have spoken [it], I will also bring it to pass; I have purposed [it], I will also do it.<br><a name="12">12</a>  Hearken unto me, ye stouthearted, that [are] far from righteousness:<br><a name="13">13</a>  I bring near my righteousness; it shall not be far off, and my salvation shall not tarry: and I will place salvation in Zion for Israel my glory.<br><br>Go to <a href="isa47.htm#1">Isaiah 47</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
