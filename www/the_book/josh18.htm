Joshua  18<br>1. And the whole congregation of the children of Israel assembled together at Shiloh, and set up the tabernacle of the congregation there. And the land was subdued before them.<br><a name="2">2</a>. And there remained among the children of Israel seven tribes, which had not yet received their inheritance.<br><a name="3">3</a>  And Joshua said unto the children of Israel, How long [are] ye slack to go to possess the land, which the LORD God of your fathers hath given you?<br><a name="4">4</a>  Give out from among you three men for [each] tribe: and I will send them, and they shall rise, and go through the land, and describe it according to the inheritance of them; and they shall come [again] to me.<br><a name="5">5</a>  And they shall divide it into seven parts: Judah shall abide in their coast on the south, and the house of Joseph shall abide in their coasts on the north.<br><a name="6">6</a>  Ye shall therefore describe the land [into] seven parts, and bring [the description] hither to me, that I may cast lots for you here before the LORD our God.<br><a name="7">7</a>  But the Levites have no part among you; for the priesthood of the LORD [is] their inheritance: and Gad, and Reuben, and half the tribe of Manasseh, have received their inheritance beyond Jordan on the east, which Moses the servant of the LORD gave them.<br><a name="8">8</a>  And the men arose, and went away: and Joshua charged them that went to describe the land, saying, Go and walk through the land, and describe it, and come again to me, that I may here cast lots for you before the LORD in Shiloh.<br><a name="9">9</a>  And the men went and passed through the land, and described it by cities into seven parts in a book, and came [again] to Joshua to the host at Shiloh.<br><a name="10">10</a>  And Joshua cast lots for them in Shiloh before the LORD: and there Joshua divided the land unto the children of Israel according to their divisions.<br><a name="11">11</a>. And the lot of the tribe of the children of Benjamin came up according to their families: and the coast of their lot came forth between the children of Judah and the children of Joseph.<br><a name="12">12</a>  And their border on the north side was from Jordan; and the border went up to the side of Jericho on the north side, and went up through the mountains westward; and the goings out thereof were at the wilderness of Bethaven.<br><a name="13">13</a>  And the border went over from thence toward Luz, to the side of Luz, which [is] Bethel, southward; and the border descended to Atarothadar, near the hill that [lieth] on the south side of the nether Bethhoron.<br><a name="14">14</a>  And the border was drawn [thence], and compassed the corner of the sea southward, from the hill that [lieth] before Bethhoron southward; and the goings out thereof were at Kirjathbaal, which [is] Kirjathjearim, a city of the children of Judah: this [was] the west quarter.<br><a name="15">15</a>  And the south quarter [was] from the end of Kirjathjearim, and the border went out on the west, and went out to the well of waters of Nephtoah:<br><a name="16">16</a>  And the border came down to the end of the mountain that [lieth] before the valley of the son of Hinnom, [and] which [is] in the valley of the giants on the north, and descended to the valley of Hinnom, to the side of Jebusi on the south, and descended to Enrogel,<br><a name="17">17</a>  And was drawn from the north, and went forth to Enshemesh, and went forth toward Geliloth, which [is] over against the going up of Adummim, and descended to the stone of Bohan the son of Reuben,<br><a name="18">18</a>  And passed along toward the side over against Arabah northward, and went down unto Arabah:<br><a name="19">19</a>  And the border passed along to the side of Bethhoglah northward: and the outgoings of the border were at the north bay of the salt sea at the south end of Jordan: this [was] the south coast.<br><a name="20">20</a>  And Jordan was the border of it on the east side. This [was] the inheritance of the children of Benjamin, by the coasts thereof round about, according to their families.<br><a name="21">21</a>  Now the cities of the tribe of the children of Benjamin according to their families were Jericho, and Bethhoglah, and the valley of Keziz,<br><a name="22">22</a>  And Betharabah, and Zemaraim, and Bethel,<br><a name="23">23</a>  And Avim, and Parah, and Ophrah,<br><a name="24">24</a>  And Chepharhaammonai, and Ophni, and Gaba; twelve cities with their villages:<br><a name="25">25</a>  Gibeon, and Ramah, and Beeroth,<br><a name="26">26</a>  And Mizpeh, and Chephirah, and Mozah,<br><a name="27">27</a>  And Rekem, and Irpeel, and Taralah,<br><a name="28">28</a>  And Zelah, Eleph, and Jebusi, which [is] Jerusalem, Gibeath, [and] Kirjath; fourteen cities with their villages. This [is] the inheritance of the children of Benjamin according to their families.<br><br>Go to <a href="josh19.htm#1">Joshua 19</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
