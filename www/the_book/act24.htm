Acts  24<br>1. And after five days Ananias the high priest descended with the elders, and [with] a certain orator [named] Tertullus, who informed the governor against Paul.<br><a name="2">2</a>  And when he was called forth, Tertullus began to accuse [him], saying, Seeing that by thee we enjoy great quietness, and that very worthy deeds are done unto this nation by thy providence,<br><a name="3">3</a>  We accept [it] always, and in all places, most noble Felix, with all thankfulness.<br><a name="4">4</a>  Notwithstanding, that I be not further tedious unto thee, I pray thee that thou wouldest hear us of thy clemency a few words.<br><a name="5">5</a>  For we have found this man [a] pestilent [fellow], and a mover of sedition among all the Jews throughout the world, and a ringleader of the sect of the Nazarenes:<br><a name="6">6</a>  Who also hath gone about to profane the temple: whom we took, and would have judged according to our law.<br><a name="7">7</a>  But the chief captain Lysias came [upon us], and with great violence took [him] away out of our hands,<br><a name="8">8</a>  Commanding his accusers to come unto thee: by examining of whom thyself mayest take knowledge of all these things, whereof we accuse him.<br><a name="9">9</a>  And the Jews also assented, saying that these things were so.<br><a name="10">10</a>. Then Paul, after that the governor had beckoned unto him to speak, answered, Forasmuch as I know that thou hast been of many years a judge unto this nation, I do the more cheerfully answer for myself:<br><a name="11">11</a>  Because that thou mayest understand, that there are yet but twelve days since I went up to Jerusalem for to worship.<br><a name="12">12</a>  And they neither found me in the temple disputing with any man, neither raising up the people, neither in the synagogues, nor in the city:<br><a name="13">13</a>  Neither can they prove the things whereof they now accuse me.<br><a name="14">14</a>  But this I confess unto thee, that after the way which they call heresy, so worship I the God of my fathers, believing all things which are written in the law and in the prophets:<br><a name="15">15</a>  And have hope toward God, which they themselves also allow, that there shall be a resurrection of the dead, both of the just and unjust.<br><a name="16">16</a>  And herein do I exercise myself, to have always a conscience void of offence toward God, and [toward] men.<br><a name="17">17</a>  Now after many years I came to bring alms to my nation, and offerings.<br><a name="18">18</a>  Whereupon certain Jews from Asia found me purified in the temple, neither with multitude, nor with tumult.<br><a name="19">19</a>  Who ought to have been here before thee, and object, if they had ought against me.<br><a name="20">20</a>  Or else let these same [here] say, if they have found any evil doing in me, while I stood before the council,<br><a name="21">21</a>  Except it be for this one voice, that I cried standing among them, Touching the resurrection of the dead I am called in question by you this day.<br><a name="22">22</a>. And when Felix heard these things, having more perfect knowledge of [that] way, he deferred them, and said, When Lysias the chief captain shall come down, I will know the uttermost of your matter.<br><a name="23">23</a>  And he commanded a centurion to keep Paul, and to let [him] have liberty, and that he should forbid none of his acquaintance to minister or come unto him.<br><a name="24">24</a>  And after certain days, when Felix came with his wife Drusilla, which was a Jewess, he sent for Paul, and heard him concerning the faith in Christ.<br><a name="25">25</a>  And as he reasoned of righteousness, temperance, and judgment to come, Felix trembled, and answered, Go thy way for this time; when I have a convenient season, I will call for thee.<br><a name="26">26</a>  He hoped also that money should have been given him of Paul, that he might loose him: wherefore he sent for him the oftener, and communed with him.<br><a name="27">27</a>  But after two years Porcius Festus came into Felix' room: and Felix, willing to shew the Jews a pleasure, left Paul bound.<br><br>Go to <a href="act25.htm#1">Acts 25</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
