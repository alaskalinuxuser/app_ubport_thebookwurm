Psalms  90<br>1. A Prayer of Moses the man of God. Lord, thou hast been our dwelling place in all generations.<br><a name="2">2</a>  Before the mountains were brought forth, or ever thou hadst formed the earth and the world, even from everlasting to everlasting, thou [art] God.<br><a name="3">3</a>  Thou turnest man to destruction; and sayest, Return, ye children of men.<br><a name="4">4</a>  For a thousand years in thy sight [are but] as yesterday when it is past, and [as] a watch in the night.<br><a name="5">5</a>  Thou carriest them away as with a flood; they are [as] a sleep: in the morning [they are] like grass [which] groweth up.<br><a name="6">6</a>  In the morning it flourisheth, and groweth up; in the evening it is cut down, and withereth.<br><a name="7">7</a>. For we are consumed by thine anger, and by thy wrath are we troubled.<br><a name="8">8</a>  Thou hast set our iniquities before thee, our secret [sins] in the light of thy countenance.<br><a name="9">9</a>  For all our days are passed away in thy wrath: we spend our years as a tale [that is told].<br><a name="10">10</a>  The days of our years [are] threescore years and ten; and if by reason of strength [they be] fourscore years, yet [is] their strength labour and sorrow; for it is soon cut off, and we fly away.<br><a name="11">11</a>  Who knoweth the power of thine anger? even according to thy fear, [so is] thy wrath.<br><a name="12">12</a>. So teach [us] to number our days, that we may apply [our] hearts unto wisdom.<br><a name="13">13</a>  Return, O LORD, how long? and let it repent thee concerning thy servants.<br><a name="14">14</a>  O satisfy us early with thy mercy; that we may rejoice and be glad all our days.<br><a name="15">15</a>  Make us glad according to the days [wherein] thou hast afflicted us, [and] the years [wherein] we have seen evil.<br><a name="16">16</a>  Let thy work appear unto thy servants, and thy glory unto their children.<br><a name="17">17</a>  And let the beauty of the LORD our God be upon us: and establish thou the work of our hands upon us; yea, the work of our hands establish thou it.<br><br>Go to <a href="psa91.htm#1">Psalm 91</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
