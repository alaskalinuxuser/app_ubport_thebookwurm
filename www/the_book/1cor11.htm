1Corinthians  11<br> 1. Be ye followers of me, even as I also [am] of Christ.<br><a name="2">2</a>  Now I praise you, brethren, that ye remember me in all things, and keep the ordinances, as I delivered [them] to you.<br><a name="3">3</a>  But I would have you know, that the head of every man is Christ; and the head of the woman [is] the man; and the head of Christ [is] God.<br><a name="4">4</a>  Every man praying or prophesying, having [his] head covered, dishonoureth his head.<br><a name="5">5</a>  But every woman that prayeth or prophesieth with [her] head uncovered dishonoureth her head: for that is even all one as if she were shaven.<br><a name="6">6</a>  For if the woman be not covered, let her also be shorn: but if it be a shame for a woman to be shorn or shaven, let her be covered.<br><a name="7">7</a>  For a man indeed ought not to cover [his] head, forasmuch as he is the image and glory of God: but the woman is the glory of the man.<br><a name="8">8</a>  For the man is not of the woman; but the woman of the man.<br><a name="9">9</a>  Neither was the man created for the woman; but the woman for the man.<br><a name="10">10</a>  For this cause ought the woman to have power on [her] head because of the angels.<br><a name="11">11</a>  Nevertheless neither is the man without the woman, neither the woman without the man, in the Lord.<br><a name="12">12</a>  For as the woman [is] of the man, even so [is] the man also by the woman; but all things of God.<br><a name="13">13</a>  Judge in yourselves: is it comely that a woman pray unto God uncovered?<br><a name="14">14</a>  Doth not even nature itself teach you, that, if a man have long hair, it is a shame unto him?<br><a name="15">15</a>  But if a woman have long hair, it is a glory to her: for [her] hair is given her for a covering.<br><a name="16">16</a>  But if any man seem to be contentious, we have no such custom, neither the churches of God.<br><a name="17">17</a>. Now in this that I declare [unto you] I praise [you] not, that ye come together not for the better, but for the worse.<br><a name="18">18</a>  For first of all, when ye come together in the church, I hear that there be divisions among you; and I partly believe it.<br><a name="19">19</a>  For there must be also heresies among you, that they which are approved may be made manifest among you.<br><a name="20">20</a>  When ye come together therefore into one place, [this] is not to eat the Lord's supper.<br><a name="21">21</a>  For in eating every one taketh before [other] his own supper: and one is hungry, and another is drunken.<br><a name="22">22</a>  What? have ye not houses to eat and to drink in? or despise ye the church of God, and shame them that have not? What shall I say to you? shall I praise you in this? I praise [you] not.<br><a name="23">23</a>. For I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you, That the Lord Jesus the [same] night in which he was betrayed took bread:<br><a name="24">24</a>  And when he had given thanks, he brake [it], and said, Take, eat: this is my body, which is broken for you: this do in remembrance of me.<br><a name="25">25</a>  After the same manner also [he took] the cup, when he had supped, saying, This cup is the new testament in my blood: this do ye, as oft as ye drink [it], in remembrance of me.<br><a name="26">26</a>  For as often as ye eat this bread, and drink this cup, ye do shew the Lord's death till he come.<br><a name="27">27</a>  Wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread, and drink [this] cup of the Lord, unworthily, shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord.<br><a name="28">28</a>  But let a man examine himself, and so let him eat of [that] bread, and drink of [that] cup.<br><a name="29">29</a>  For he that eateth and drinketh unworthily, eateth and drinketh damnation to himself, not discerning the Lord's body.<br><a name="30">30</a>  For this cause many [are] weak and sickly among you, and many sleep.<br><a name="31">31</a>  For if we would judge ourselves, we should not be judged.<br><a name="32">32</a>  But when we are judged, we are chastened of the Lord, that we should not be condemned with the world.<br><a name="33">33</a>  Wherefore, my brethren, when ye come together to eat, tarry one for another.<br><a name="34">34</a>  And if any man hunger, let him eat at home; that ye come not together unto condemnation. And the rest will I set in order when I come.<br><br>Go to <a href="1cor12.htm#1">I Corinthians 12</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
