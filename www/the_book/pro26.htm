Proverbs  26<br>1. As snow in summer, and as rain in harvest, so honour is not seemly for a fool.<br><a name="2">2</a>. As the bird by wandering, as the swallow by flying, so the curse causeless shall not come.<br><a name="3">3</a>. A whip for the horse, a bridle for the ass, and a rod for the fool's back.<br><a name="4">4</a>. Answer not a fool according to his folly, lest thou also be like unto him.<br><a name="5">5</a>  Answer a fool according to his folly, lest he be wise in his own conceit.<br><a name="6">6</a>. He that sendeth a message by the hand of a fool cutteth off the feet, [and] drinketh damage.<br><a name="7">7</a>  The legs of the lame are not equal: so [is] a parable in the mouth of fools.<br><a name="8">8</a>  As he that bindeth a stone in a sling, so [is] he that giveth honour to a fool.<br><a name="9">9</a>  [As] a thorn goeth up into the hand of a drunkard, so [is] a parable in the mouth of fools.<br><a name="10">10</a>. The great [God] that formed all [things] both rewardeth the fool, and rewardeth transgressors.<br><a name="11">11</a>. As a dog returneth to his vomit, [so] a fool returneth to his folly.<br><a name="12">12</a>. Seest thou a man wise in his own conceit? [there is] more hope of a fool than of him.<br><a name="13">13</a>. The slothful [man] saith, [There is] a lion in the way; a lion [is] in the streets.<br><a name="14">14</a>. [As] the door turneth upon his hinges, so [doth] the slothful upon his bed.<br><a name="15">15</a>. The slothful hideth his hand in [his] bosom; it grieveth him to bring it again to his mouth.<br><a name="16">16</a>. The sluggard [is] wiser in his own conceit than seven men that can render a reason.<br><a name="17">17</a>. He that passeth by, [and] meddleth with strife [belonging] not to him, [is like] one that taketh a dog by the ears.<br><a name="18">18</a>. As a mad [man] who casteth firebrands, arrows, and death,<br><a name="19">19</a>  So [is] the man [that] deceiveth his neighbour, and saith, Am not I in sport?<br><a name="20">20</a>. Where no wood is, [there] the fire goeth out: so where [there is] no talebearer, the strife ceaseth.<br><a name="21">21</a>  [As] coals [are] to burning coals, and wood to fire; so [is] a contentious man to kindle strife.<br><a name="22">22</a>  The words of a talebearer [are] as wounds, and they go down into the innermost parts of the belly.<br><a name="23">23</a>. Burning lips and a wicked heart [are like] a potsherd covered with silver dross.<br><a name="24">24</a>. He that hateth dissembleth with his lips, and layeth up deceit within him;<br><a name="25">25</a>  When he speaketh fair, believe him not: for [there are] seven abominations in his heart.<br><a name="26">26</a>  [Whose] hatred is covered by deceit, his wickedness shall be shewed before the [whole] congregation.<br><a name="27">27</a>. Whoso diggeth a pit shall fall therein: and he that rolleth a stone, it will return upon him.<br><a name="28">28</a>. A lying tongue hateth [those that are] afflicted by it; and a flattering mouth worketh ruin.<br><br>Go to <a href="pro27.htm#1">Proverbs 27</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
