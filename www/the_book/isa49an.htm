<b>1. The Holy One, Israel's Redeemer, is also the Salvation of the gentiles,</b> 49:1-26</dl>
<dt>This section,  focusing on the Suffering Servant (ch. 49-57), opens with a gracious invitation<dd> to the Gentiles (<a href="isa49.htm#1" target="lwr_lt">v.1</a>), whereas the previous section was addressed to Israel (<a href="isa40.htm#1">Isa 40:1,2</a>). Both sections close with a solemn warning (<a href="isa48.htm#22">Isa 48:22</a>; <a href="isa57.htm#21">Isa 57:21</a>). The two warnings are nearly identical, except that in the section addressed to the Gentiles, the warning is stated as coming from 'God' (Elohim), and in the section addressed to Israel, it comes from 'the LORD' (Jehovah, the God of Israel's covenant).<dt>Between the invitation and the warning, the present section describes...<dd>&quot;the period during which Israel is Lo-Ammi [<a href="hos1.htm#9">Hos 1:9</a>], and its Divine action is set out in <a href="rom9.htm#1">Romans 9 to 11</a>, and in <a href="2cor6.htm#2">2Cor 6:2</a>. Its theme is Israel's rejection and crucifixion of the promised Messiah, their consequent temporary dis-ownment by God, and the offering of the Kingdom of Heaven to the Gentiles. Out of these (ie., the Gentiles), an election is predicted during the time of Israel's blindness; and when that blindness is healed, all the Gentiles, including that election, will be given to Israel as sons and daughters. This will fill Zion with amazement. The Church does not, of course, appear&quot; in this section, since it was a mystery hidden in Old Testament times (<a href="eph3.htm#1">Eph 3:1-10</a>). [in quotes, GWms]<dt>&nbsp;
<dt><b><i>1. Listen, O isles, unto me; and hearken, ye people, from far;<br>The LORD hath called me from the womb;<br>from the bowels of my mother hath he made mention of my name.<br>
2 And he hath made my mouth like a sharp sword;<br>in the shadow of his hand hath he hid me,<br>
and made me a polished shaft </b></i>{ie., a select, or, proven arrow}<i><b>;<br>in his quiver hath he hid me;<br>
3 And said unto me, Thou [art] my servant, O Israel, in whom I will be glorified.</i></b></dt><dl>
<dt>Listen, O isles... The LORD hath called me from the womb...- 
<dd>The speaker is Israel's Messiah, who was named before His conception (<a href="mat1.htm#21">Mat 1:21</a>; <a href="luk1.htm#31">Luk 1:31</a>).<br>He addresses the 'isles' {ie., coastlands, people from afar, gentiles} because He is the Savior of the world, not only of the Jewish nation. <a href="joh4.htm#42">Joh 4:42</a>; <a href="1joh4.htm#14">1Joh 4:14</a>; <a href="rom3.htm#29">Rom 3:29,30</a>
<dt>and he hath made my mouth like a sharp sword...- cp. <a href="mat7.htm#28">Mat 7:28,29</a>; <a href="joh7.htm#46">Joh 7:46</a>; <a href="heb4.htm#12">Heb 4:12</a>; <a href="rev19.htm#15">Rev 19:15</a>
<dt>and [the LORD] said unto me, Thou [art] my servant, O Israel...-<dd>The name 'Israel' is applied here to the Messiah.<ul><li>The nation of Israel had failed to glorify the LORD, because of their sinful rebellion.<dd>They fell short of the position that He desired for them (cp. <a href="ex19.htm#5">Ex 19:5,6</a>). The Messiah, as the only truly holy and perfect prophet, priest and king, would fulfill the role of Israel {'a prince toward God'} for the glory of the Father (cp. <a href="isa42.htm#1">Isa 42:1-4</a>; <a href="mat17.htm#5">Mat 17:5</a>; <a href="joh13.htm#31">Joh 13:31,32</a>; <a href="joh17.htm#1">17:1,4</a>).</dd><li>The dual application of the name 'Israel' to the nation and also to the Messiah is not unique to this passage.<dd>(For example, see <a href="hos11.htm#1">Hos 11:1</a> with <a href="mat2.htm#15">Mat 2:15</a>.)</dd><li>As the true Israel...<ul><li>the Messiah would bear witness to the LORD and His purposes (fulfilling a role which the nation failed to do).<dd>Israel was to be His witness, but they were blind to His truth (<a href="isa43.htm#8">Isa 43:8-13</a>). Yet, God would make Himself known through the way He dealt with His rebellious people. Someday, they will understand and make Him known (<a href="isa44.htm#1">44:1-8</a>). But, meanwhile, the Messiah would faithfully declare the LORD (eg., <a href="psa40.htm#7">Psa 40:7-10</a>; <a href="joh1.htm#14">Joh 1:14,18</a>; <a href="rev1.htm#5">Rev 1:5</a>; <a href="rev3.htm#14">3:14</a>).<li>the Messiah would do for Israel what they could not do for themselves,<dd>in order to redeem His people from their fallen state and restore them to the place of glory (<a href="isa44.htm#21">Isa 44:21-23</a>; <a href="isa45.htm#21">45:21-25</a>; <a href="isa46.htm#13">46:13</a>; cp. <a href="1pet2.htm#7">1Pet 2:7-10</a>).</dd></ul></ul></dl>
<dt><b><i>4 Then I said, I have laboured in vain, I have spent my strength for nought, and in vain:<br>[yet] surely my judgment [is] with the LORD, and my work with my God. </b></i>{<a href="1pet2.htm#22">1Pet 2:22,23</a>}<br>
<b><i>5 And now, saith the LORD that formed me from the womb [to be] his servant, to bring Jacob again to him,<br>Though Israel be not gathered, yet shall I be glorious in the eyes of the LORD, and my God shall be my strength.</i></b><dd>God sent the Messiah to bring Jacob {ie., the wayward house of Israel} back to Him (<a href="mat15.htm#24">Mat 15:24</a>; <a href="act10.htm#36">Acts 10:36</a>; <a href="rom15.htm#8">Rom 15:8</a>).<dd>Yet, Israel did not receive Him or His message.<dd>It seemed that His work had been fruitless (cp. <a href="isa65.htm#1">Isa 65:1,2</a>; <a href="rom10.htm#20">Rom 10:20,21</a>; <a href="mat17.htm#17">Mat 17:17</a>; <a href="mat23.htm#37">23:37</a>; <a href="joh1.htm#11">Joh 1:11</a>).<dd>Even so, that purpose, though temporarily delayed, will be fulfilled, through the LORD's power, and to the everlasting honor of the Savior (cp. <a href="rom11.htm#25">Rom 11:25-36</a>; <a href="joh17.htm#4">Joh 17:4,5</a>).
<dt><b><i>6 And he said, It is a light thing </b></i>{ie., an insignificant thing, cp. <a href="2kin20.htm#10">2Kin 20:10</a>}<i><b><br>that thou shouldest be my servant to raise up the tribes of Jacob,<br>and to restore the preserved of Israel:<br>I will also give thee for a light to the Gentiles,<br>that thou mayest be my salvation unto the end of the earth.</i></b><dd>light to the Gentiles... salvation...- cp. <a href="luk2.htm#32">Luk 2:32</a>; <a href="joh1.htm#4">Joh 1:4-9</a>; <a href="act13.htm#45">Acts 13:45-47</a><br><br>

<dt>In <a href="isa49.htm#1" target="lwr_lt">vs.1-6</a>, the Messiah speaks first to the gentile nations of the LORD's purpose in sending Him (vs.1-3),<dd>and secondly to the LORD, confessing His apparent failure to accomplish that purpose (v.4). Then, He tells us that the LORD answered, encouraging Him, that an even greater purpose would be accomplished through His suffering and rejection (vs.5,6).<dt>In vs.7-12, we are allowed to listen in, as the LORD reminds His beloved Son<dd>of the future glories of that extended purpose. cp. <a href="isa53.htm#11">Isa 53:11</a>
<dt>to him whom the nation abhorreth... kings shall see and arise, princes also shall worship...-<dd>At His first coming, the Messiah was rejected by His own people (<a href="joh1.htm#10">Joh 1:10-12</a>; <a href="rom11.htm#11">Rom 11:11,12</a>).<dd>At His second coming, the people of every nation will bow before Him in worship (<a href="isa45.htm#23">Isa 45:23</a>; <a href="php2.htm#8">Php 2:8-11</a>; <a href="isa52.htm#13">Isa 52:13-15</a>).</dl>

16 Behold, I have graven thee upon the palms of [my] hands;<br>thy walls [are] continually before me.</i></b></dt><dl><dt>...my hands...- The LORD's hand, powerfully prepared for war (<a href="isa49.htm#2" target="lwr_lt">v.2</a>),<dd>is deeply marked with love for His people. cp. <a href="zech13.htm#6">Zech 13:6</a>; <a href="joh20.htm#27">Joh 20:27</a><dt>thy walls are continually before me.- cp. <a href="deu11.htm#12">Deu 11:12</a>; <a href="2chr7.htm#15">2Chr 7:15,16</a>; <a href="mat23.htm#37">Mat 23:37</a>
<dd>Yet, despite the LORD's prophetic Word concerning their restoration through the Messiah, the people of Israel fail to see His hand in all of their struggles (<a href="isa49.htm#14" target="lwr_lt">v.14</a>). Therefore, He assures them, yet more.</dl>
<dt><b><i>17 Thy children shall make haste;<br>thy destroyers and they that made thee waste shall go forth of thee.<br>

21 Then shalt thou say in thine heart, Who hath begotten me these,<br>seeing I have lost my children, and am desolate, a captive, and removing to and fro?<br>and who hath brought up these? Behold, I was left alone; these, where [had] they [been]?</i></b><dd>
