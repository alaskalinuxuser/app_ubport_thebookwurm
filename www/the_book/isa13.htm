Isaiah  13<br>1. The burden of Babylon, which Isaiah the son of Amoz did see.<br><a name="2">2</a>  Lift ye up a banner upon the high mountain, exalt the voice unto them, shake the hand, that they may go into the gates of the nobles.<br><a name="3">3</a>  I have commanded my sanctified ones, I have also called my mighty ones for mine anger, [even] them that rejoice in my highness.<br><a name="4">4</a>  The noise of a multitude in the mountains, like as of a great people; a tumultuous noise of the kingdoms of nations gathered together: the LORD of hosts mustereth the host of the battle.<br><a name="5">5</a>  They come from a far country, from the end of heaven, [even] the LORD, and the weapons of his indignation, to destroy the whole land.<br><a name="6">6</a>. Howl ye; for the day of the LORD [is] at hand; it shall come as a destruction from the Almighty.<br><a name="7">7</a>  Therefore shall all hands be faint, and every man's heart shall melt:<br><a name="8">8</a>  And they shall be afraid: pangs and sorrows shall take hold of them; they shall be in pain as a woman that travaileth: they shall be amazed one at another; their faces [shall be as] flames.<br><a name="9">9</a>  Behold, the day of the LORD cometh, cruel both with wrath and fierce anger, to lay the land desolate: and he shall destroy the sinners thereof out of it.<br><a name="10">10</a>  For the stars of heaven and the constellations thereof shall not give their light: the sun shall be darkened in his going forth, and the moon shall not cause her light to shine.<br><a name="11">11</a>  And I will punish the world for [their] evil, and the wicked for their iniquity; and I will cause the arrogancy of the proud to cease, and will lay low the haughtiness of the terrible.<br><a name="12">12</a>  I will make a man more precious than fine gold; even a man than the golden wedge of Ophir.<br><a name="13">13</a>  Therefore I will shake the heavens, and the earth shall remove out of her place, in the wrath of the LORD of hosts, and in the day of his fierce anger.<br><a name="14">14</a>  And it shall be as the chased roe, and as a sheep that no man taketh up: they shall every man turn to his own people, and flee every one into his own land.<br><a name="15">15</a>  Every one that is found shall be thrust through; and every one that is joined [unto them] shall fall by the sword.<br><a name="16">16</a>  Their children also shall be dashed to pieces before their eyes; their houses shall be spoiled, and their wives ravished.<br><a name="17">17</a>  Behold, I will stir up the Medes against them, which shall not regard silver; and [as for] gold, they shall not delight in it.<br><a name="18">18</a>  [Their] bows also shall dash the young men to pieces; and they shall have no pity on the fruit of the womb; their eye shall not spare children.<br><a name="19">19</a>. And Babylon, the glory of kingdoms, the beauty of the Chaldees' excellency, shall be as when God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah.<br><a name="20">20</a>  It shall never be inhabited, neither shall it be dwelt in from generation to generation: neither shall the Arabian pitch tent there; neither shall the shepherds make their fold there.<br><a name="21">21</a>  But wild beasts of the desert shall lie there; and their houses shall be full of doleful creatures; and owls shall dwell there, and satyrs shall dance there.<br><a name="22">22</a>  And the wild beasts of the islands shall cry in their desolate houses, and dragons in [their] pleasant palaces: and her time [is] near to come, and her days shall not be prolonged.<br><br>Go to <a href="isa14.htm#1">Isaiah 14</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
