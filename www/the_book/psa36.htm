Psalms  36<br> 1. To the chief Musician, [A Psalm] of David the servant of the LORD. The transgression of the wicked saith within my heart, [that there is] no fear of God before his eyes.<br><a name="2">2</a>  For he flattereth himself in his own eyes, until his iniquity be found to be hateful.<br><a name="3">3</a>  The words of his mouth [are] iniquity and deceit: he hath left off to be wise, [and] to do good.<br><a name="4">4</a>  He deviseth mischief upon his bed; he setteth himself in a way [that is] not good; he abhorreth not evil.<br><a name="5">5</a>. Thy mercy, O LORD, [is] in the heavens; [and] thy faithfulness [reacheth] unto the clouds.<br><a name="6">6</a>  Thy righteousness [is] like the great mountains; thy judgments [are] a great deep: O LORD, thou preservest man and beast.<br><a name="7">7</a>  How excellent [is] thy lovingkindness, O God! therefore the children of men put their trust under the shadow of thy wings.<br><a name="8">8</a>  They shall be abundantly satisfied with the fatness of thy house; and thou shalt make them drink of the river of thy pleasures.<br><a name="9">9</a>  For with thee [is] the fountain of life: in thy light shall we see light.<br><a name="10">10</a>  O continue thy lovingkindness unto them that know thee; and thy righteousness to the upright in heart.<br><a name="11">11</a>  Let not the foot of pride come against me, and let not the hand of the wicked remove me.<br><a name="12">12</a>  There are the workers of iniquity fallen: they are cast down, and shall not be able to rise.<br><br>Go to <a href="psa37.htm#1">Psalm 37</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
