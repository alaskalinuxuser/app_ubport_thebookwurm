Therefore, my brethren dearly beloved and longed for, my joy and crown, so stand fast in the Lord, [my] dearly beloved.<br><a name="2">2</a>  I beseech Euodias, and beseech Syntyche, that they be of the same mind in the Lord.<br><a name="3">3</a>  And I intreat thee also, true yokefellow, help those women which laboured with me in the gospel, with Clement also, and [with] other my fellowlabourers, whose names [are] in the book of life.<br><a name="4">4</a>  Rejoice in the Lord alway: [and] again I say, Rejoice.<br><a name="5">5</a>  Let your moderation be known unto all men. The Lord [is] at hand.<br> <a name="6"></a>6  Be careful for nothing; but in every thing by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known unto God.<br><a name="7">7</a>  And the peace of God, which passeth all understanding, shall keep your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus.<br><a name="8">8</a>  Finally, brethren, whatsoever things are true, whatsoever things [are] honest, whatsoever things [are] just, whatsoever things [are] pure, whatsoever things [are] lovely, whatsoever things [are] of good report; if [there be] any virtue, and if [there be] any praise, think on these things.<br><a name="9">9</a>  Those things, which ye have both learned, and received, and heard, and seen in me, do: and the God of peace shall be with you.<br><a name="10">10</a>. But I rejoiced in the Lord greatly, that now at the last your care of me hath flourished again; wherein ye were also careful, but ye lacked opportunity.<br><a name="11">11</a>  Not that I speak in respect of want: for I have learned, in whatsoever state I am, [therewith] to be content.<br><a name="12">12</a>  I know both how to be abased, and I know how to abound: every where and in all things I am instructed both to be full and to be hungry, both to abound and to suffer need.<br><a name="13">13</a>  I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me.<br><a name="14">14</a>  Notwithstanding ye have well done, that ye did communicate with my affliction.<br><a name="15">15</a>  Now ye Philippians know also, that in the beginning of the gospel, when I departed from Macedonia, no church communicated with me as concerning giving and receiving, but ye only.<br><a name="16">16</a>  For even in Thessalonica ye sent once and again unto my necessity.<br><a name="17">17</a>  Not because I desire a gift: but I desire fruit that may abound to your account.<br><a name="18">18</a>  But I have all, and abound: I am full, having received of Epaphroditus the things [which were sent] from you, an odour of a sweet smell, a sacrifice acceptable, wellpleasing to God.<br><a name="19">19</a>  But my God shall supply all your need according to his riches in glory by Christ Jesus.<br><a name="20">20</a>. Now unto God and our Father [be] glory for ever and ever. Amen.<br><a name="21">21</a>  Salute every saint in Christ Jesus. The brethren which are with me greet you.<br><a name="22">22</a>  All the saints salute you, chiefly they that are of Caesar's household.<br><a name="23">23</a>  The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ [be] with you all. Amen.<br><br>End of Philippians.<br>Go to <a href="col1.htm#1">Colossians 1</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
