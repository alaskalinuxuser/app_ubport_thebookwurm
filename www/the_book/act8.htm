And at that time there was a great persecution against the church which was at Jerusalem; and they were all scattered abroad throughout the regions of Judaea and Samaria, except the apostles.<br><a name="2">2</a>  And devout men carried Stephen [to his burial], and made great lamentation over him.<br><a name="3">3</a>  As for Saul, he made havock of the church, entering into every house, and haling men and women committed [them] to prison.<br><a name="4">4</a>. Therefore they that were scattered abroad went every where preaching the word.<br><a name="5">5</a>  Then Philip went down to the city of Samaria, and preached Christ unto them.<br><a name="6">6</a>  And the people with one accord gave heed unto those things which Philip spake, hearing and seeing the miracles which he did.<br><a name="7">7</a>  For unclean spirits, crying with loud voice, came out of many that were possessed [with them]: and many taken with palsies, and that were lame, were healed.<br><a name="8">8</a>  And there was great joy in that city.<br><a name="9">9</a>  But there was a certain man, called Simon, which beforetime in the same city used sorcery, and bewitched the people of Samaria, giving out that himself was some great one:<br><a name="10">10</a>  To whom they all gave heed, from the least to the greatest, saying, This man is the great power of God.<br><a name="11">11</a>  And to him they had regard, because that of long time he had bewitched them with sorceries.<br><a name="12">12</a>  But when they believed Philip preaching the things concerning the kingdom of God, and the name of Jesus Christ, they were baptized, both men and women.<br><a name="13">13</a>  Then Simon himself believed also: and when he was baptized, he continued with Philip, and wondered, beholding the miracles and signs which were done.<br><a name="14">14</a>. Now when the apostles which were at Jerusalem heard that Samaria had received the word of God, they sent unto them Peter and John:<br><a name="15">15</a>  Who, when they were come down, prayed for them, that they might receive the Holy Ghost:<br><a name="16">16</a>  (For as yet he was fallen upon none of them: only they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.)<br><a name="17">17</a>  Then laid they [their] hands on them, and they received the Holy Ghost.<br><a name="18">18</a>  And when Simon saw that through laying on of the apostles' hands the Holy Ghost was given, he offered them money,<br><a name="19">19</a>  Saying, Give me also this power, that on whomsoever I lay hands, he may receive the Holy Ghost.<br><a name="20">20</a>  But Peter said unto him, Thy money perish with thee, because thou hast thought that the gift of God may be purchased with money.<br><a name="21">21</a>  Thou hast neither part nor lot in this matter: for thy heart is not right in the sight of God.<br><a name="22">22</a>  Repent therefore of this thy wickedness, and pray God, if perhaps the thought of thine heart may be forgiven thee.<br><a name="23">23</a>  For I perceive that thou art in the gall of bitterness, and [in] the bond of iniquity.<br><a name="24">24</a>  Then answered Simon, and said, Pray ye to the Lord for me, that none of these things which ye have spoken come upon me.<br><a name="25">25</a>  And they, when they had testified and preached the word of the Lord, returned to Jerusalem, and preached the gospel in many villages of the Samaritans.<br><a name="26">26</a>. And the angel of the Lord spake unto Philip, saying, Arise, and go toward the south unto the way that goeth down from Jerusalem unto Gaza, which is desert.<br><a name="27">27</a>  And he arose and went: and, behold, a man of Ethiopia, an eunuch of great authority under Candace queen of the Ethiopians, who had the charge of all her treasure, and had come to Jerusalem for to worship,<br><a name="28">28</a>  Was returning, and sitting in his chariot read Esaias the prophet.<br><a name="29">29</a>  Then the Spirit said unto Philip, Go near, and join thyself to this chariot.<br><a name="30">30</a>  And Philip ran thither to [him], and heard him read the prophet Esaias, and said, Understandest thou what thou readest?<br><a name="31">31</a>  And he said, How can I, except some man should guide me? And he desired Philip that he would come up and sit with him.<br><a name="32">32</a>  The place of the scripture which he read was this, He was led as a sheep to the slaughter; and like a lamb dumb before his shearer, so opened he not his mouth:<br><a name="33">33</a>  In his humiliation his judgment was taken away: and who shall declare his generation? for his life is taken from the earth.<br><a name="34">34</a>  And the eunuch answered Philip, and said, I pray thee, of whom speaketh the prophet this? of himself, or of some other man?<br><a name="35">35</a>  Then Philip opened his mouth, and began at the same scripture, and preached unto him Jesus.<br><a name="36">36</a>  And as they went on [their] way, they came unto a certain water: and the eunuch said, See, [here is] water; what doth hinder me to be baptized?<br><a name="37">37</a>  And Philip said, If thou believest with all thine heart, thou mayest. And he answered and said, I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God.<br><a name="38">38</a>  And he commanded the chariot to stand still: and they went down both into the water, both Philip and the eunuch; and he baptized him.<br><a name="39">39</a>  And when they were come up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord caught away Philip, that the eunuch saw him no more: and he went on his way rejoicing.<br><a name="40">40</a>  But Philip was found at Azotus: and passing through he preached in all the cities, till he came to Caesarea.<br><br>Go to <a href="act9.htm#1">Acts 9</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
