<b>Volume 2, Lesson 3</b><br>
by C.I. Scofield
<h2>The Blood of Christ</h2></center>
It has been well said that a &quot;scarlet thread runs through the Scriptures.&quot; From the lamb of Abel, who &quot;obtained witness that he was righteous, God testifying of his gifts&quot; (not of his goodness; see <a href="gen4.htm#4">Genesis 4:4</a> with <a href="heb11.htm#4">Hebrews 11:4</a>), to the &quot;Lamb as it had been slain,&quot; of <a href="rev5.htm#6">Revelation 5:6</a>, this scarlet line of atonement through blood may be traced. The types drip with blood -- the importance of blood in the purpose of God is shown by the fact that it is mentioned 427 times in Scripture. Consider the importance of blood to the believer:
<b><ol type="A">
<li>Blood is the price of his redemption (the act of saving from sin)</b><br>It is always said that the believer <i>has</i> redemption, not <i>may have redemption</i>. Every believer is redeemed.<ul>
<li><a href="act20.htm#28">Acts 20:28</a> - &quot;He hath purchased with His own blood&quot;
<li><a href="eph1.htm#7">Ephesians 1:7</a> - &quot;We have redemption through His blood&quot; (see also <a href="col1.htm#14">Colossians 1:14</a>)
<li><a href="1pet1.htm#18">1Peter 1:18,19</a> - &quot;But with the precious blood of Christ&quot;
<li><a href="rev5.htm#9">Revelation 5:9</a> - &quot;Redeemed... by Thy blood&quot;</ul><b>
<li>Blood is the ground of his forgiveness</b><br>Our forgiveness is immediate and absolute. &quot;All trespass&quot; means just what is says. Some would add to God's perfect Word by inserting &quot;past&quot; before &quot;trespasses.&quot;<ul>
<li><a href="eph1.htm#7">Ephesians 1:7</a> - &quot;We have redemption through His blood&quot; (see also <a href="col1.htm#14">Colossians 1:14</a>)
<li><a href="heb9.htm#22">Hebrews 9:22</a> - &quot;Without... blood... no remission&quot;
<li><a href="col2.htm#13">Colossians 2:13</a> - &quot;Having forgiven you all trespasses&quot;</ul><b>
<li>Blood is the ground of his justification (the act of being made right before God, as in <a href="rom5.htm#8">Romans 5:8,9</a>).</b><br>Three statements are made in Romans about justification of the believer. In these Scriptures, the believer is:<ol type="a">
<li>Justified by blood<ul>
<li><a href="rom5.htm#9">Romans 5:9</a> - &quot;Justified by His blood.&quot; The grounds of justification.</ul>
<li>Justified by faith<ul>
<li><a href="rom5.htm#1">Romans 5:1</a> - &quot;Justified by faith.&quot; The means of justification.</ul>
<li>Justified by Christ's resurrection<ul>
<li><a href="rom4.htm#25">Romans 4:25</a> - &quot;Was raised for our justification.&quot; The proof of justification.</ul>It is said we are <i>now</i> justified. Justification, like redemption and forgiveness, is a <i>present</i> gift.</ol><b>
<li>Blood is the ground of his peace</b><br>It is grossly unscriptural to speak of &quot;making our peace with God.&quot; It is made and we only have to accept it. God is satisfied with Christ's work. When the sinner is satisfied with it, too, there is perfect peace between himself and God.<ul>
<li><a href="col1.htm#20">Colossians 1:20</a> - &quot;Made peace through the blood of His cross&quot;
<li><a href="rom5.htm#1">Romans 5:1</a> - &quot;We have peace with God&quot;</ul><b>
<li>Blood is the ground of his cleansing</b><ul> <li><a href="rev1.htm#5">Revelation 1:5</a> - &quot;Washed us from our sins in His own blood.&quot;<br>It is &quot;washed&quot; -- past tense. The believer is washed.</ul><b>
<li>Blood is the means of his access to God</b><br>The believer is &quot;made nigh.&quot; It is simple unbelief to speak of being &quot;far from God&quot; if you &quot;confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised Him from the dead&quot; (<a href="rom10.htm#9">Romans 10:9</a>).<ul>
<li><a href="heb10.htm#19">Hebrews 10:19</a> - &quot;Boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood&quot;
<li><a href="eph2.htm#13">Ephesians 2:13</a> - &quot;Ye... are made nigh by the blood of Christ&quot;</ul><b>
<li>Blood is the basis of Christian fellowship</b><ul>
<li><a href="1cor10.htm#16">1Corinthians 10:16,17</a> - &quot;The blood of Christ... for we being many... are one body.&quot; By whatever denominational name we may be called, or whatever difference there may be in outward things, we must treat as brethren all who confess salvation through the blood of Christ alone.</ul></ol>
