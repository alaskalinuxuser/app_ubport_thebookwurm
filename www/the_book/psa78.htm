Psalms  78<br> 1. Maschil of Asaph. Give ear, O my people, [to] my law: incline your ears to the words of my mouth.<br><a name="2">2</a>  I will open my mouth in a parable: I will utter dark sayings of old:<br><a name="3">3</a>  Which we have heard and known, and our fathers have told us.<br><a name="4">4</a>  We will not hide [them] from their children, shewing to the generation to come the praises of the LORD, and his strength, and his wonderful works that he hath done.<br><a name="5">5</a>  For he established a testimony in Jacob, and appointed a law in Israel, which he commanded our fathers, that they should make them known to their children:<br><a name="6">6</a>  That the generation to come might know [them, even] the children [which] should be born; [who] should arise and declare [them] to their children:<br><a name="7">7</a>  That they might set their hope in God, and not forget the works of God, but keep his commandments:<br><a name="8">8</a>  And might not be as their fathers, a stubborn and rebellious generation; a generation [that] set not their heart aright, and whose spirit was not stedfast with God.<br><a name="9">9</a>. The children of Ephraim, [being] armed, [and] carrying bows, turned back in the day of battle.<br><a name="10">10</a>  They kept not the covenant of God, and refused to walk in his law;<br><a name="11">11</a>  And forgat his works, and his wonders that he had shewed them.<br><a name="12">12</a>  Marvellous things did he in the sight of their fathers, in the land of Egypt, [in] the field of Zoan.<br><a name="13">13</a>  He divided the sea, and caused them to pass through; and he made the waters to stand as an heap.<br><a name="14">14</a>  In the daytime also he led them with a cloud, and all the night with a light of fire.<br><a name="15">15</a>  He clave the rocks in the wilderness, and gave [them] drink as [out of] the great depths.<br><a name="16">16</a>  He brought streams also out of the rock, and caused waters to run down like rivers.<br><a name="17">17</a>  And they sinned yet more against him by provoking the most High in the wilderness.<br><a name="18">18</a>  And they tempted God in their heart by asking meat for their lust.<br><a name="19">19</a>  Yea, they spake against God; they said, Can God furnish a table in the wilderness?<br><a name="20">20</a>  Behold, he smote the rock, that the waters gushed out, and the streams overflowed; can he give bread also? can he provide flesh for his people?<br><a name="21">21</a>  Therefore the LORD heard [this], and was wroth: so a fire was kindled against Jacob, and anger also came up against Israel;<br><a name="22">22</a>  Because they believed not in God, and trusted not in his salvation:<br><a name="23">23</a>  Though he had commanded the clouds from above, and opened the doors of heaven,<br><a name="24">24</a>  And had rained down manna upon them to eat, and had given them of the corn of heaven.<br><a name="25">25</a>  Man did eat angels' food: he sent them meat to the full.<br><a name="26">26</a>  He caused an east wind to blow in the heaven: and by his power he brought in the south wind.<br><a name="27">27</a>  He rained flesh also upon them as dust, and feathered fowls like as the sand of the sea:<br><a name="28">28</a>  And he let [it] fall in the midst of their camp, round about their habitations.<br><a name="29">29</a>  So they did eat, and were well filled: for he gave them their own desire;<br><a name="30">30</a>  They were not estranged from their lust. But while their meat [was] yet in their mouths,<br><a name="31">31</a>  The wrath of God came upon them, and slew the fattest of them, and smote down the chosen [men] of Israel.<br><a name="32">32</a>  For all this they sinned still, and believed not for his wondrous works.<br><a name="33">33</a>  Therefore their days did he consume in vanity, and their years in trouble.<br><a name="34">34</a>  When he slew them, then they sought him: and they returned and enquired early after God.<br><a name="35">35</a>  And they remembered that God [was] their rock, and the high God their redeemer.<br><a name="36">36</a>  Nevertheless they did flatter him with their mouth, and they lied unto him with their tongues.<br><a name="37">37</a>  For their heart was not right with him, neither were they stedfast in his covenant.<br><a name="38">38</a>  But he, [being] full of compassion, forgave [their] iniquity, and destroyed [them] not: yea, many a time turned he his anger away, and did not stir up all his wrath.<br><a name="39">39</a>  For he remembered that they [were but] flesh; a wind that passeth away, and cometh not again.<br><a name="40">40</a>. How oft did they provoke him in the wilderness, [and] grieve him in the desert!<br><a name="41">41</a>  Yea, they turned back and tempted God, and limited the Holy One of Israel.<br><a name="42">42</a>  They remembered not his hand, [nor] the day when he delivered them from the enemy.<br><a name="43">43</a>  How he had wrought his signs in Egypt, and his wonders in the field of Zoan:<br><a name="44">44</a>  And had turned their rivers into blood; and their floods, that they could not drink.<br><a name="45">45</a>  He sent divers sorts of flies among them, which devoured them; and frogs, which destroyed them.<br><a name="46">46</a>  He gave also their increase unto the caterpiller, and their labour unto the locust.<br><a name="47">47</a>  He destroyed their vines with hail, and their sycomore trees with frost.<br><a name="48">48</a>  He gave up their cattle also to the hail, and their flocks to hot thunderbolts.<br><a name="49">49</a>  He cast upon them the fierceness of his anger, wrath, and indignation, and trouble, by sending evil angels [among them].<br><a name="50">50</a>  He made a way to his anger; he spared not their soul from death, but gave their life over to the pestilence;<br><a name="51">51</a>  And smote all the firstborn in Egypt; the chief of [their] strength in the tabernacles of Ham:<br><a name="52">52</a>  But made his own people to go forth like sheep, and guided them in the wilderness like a flock.<br><a name="53">53</a>  And he led them on safely, so that they feared not: but the sea overwhelmed their enemies.<br><a name="54">54</a>  And he brought them to the border of his sanctuary, [even to] this mountain, [which] his right hand had purchased.<br><a name="55">55</a>  He cast out the heathen also before them, and divided them an inheritance by line, and made the tribes of Israel to dwell in their tents.<br><a name="56">56</a>  Yet they tempted and provoked the most high God, and kept not his testimonies:<br><a name="57">57</a>  But turned back, and dealt unfaithfully like their fathers: they were turned aside like a deceitful bow.<br><a name="58">58</a>  For they provoked him to anger with their high places, and moved him to jealousy with their graven images.<br><a name="59">59</a>  When God heard [this], he was wroth, and greatly abhorred Israel:<br><a name="60">60</a>  So that he forsook the tabernacle of Shiloh, the tent [which] he placed among men;<br><a name="61">61</a>  And delivered his strength into captivity, and his glory into the enemy's hand.<br><a name="62">62</a>  He gave his people over also unto the sword; and was wroth with his inheritance.<br><a name="63">63</a>  The fire consumed their young men; and their maidens were not given to marriage.<br><a name="64">64</a>  Their priests fell by the sword; and their widows made no lamentation.<br><a name="65">65</a>  Then the Lord awaked as one out of sleep, [and] like a mighty man that shouteth by reason of wine.<br><a name="66">66</a>  And he smote his enemies in the hinder parts: he put them to a perpetual reproach.<br><a name="67">67</a>  Moreover he refused the tabernacle of Joseph, and chose not the tribe of Ephraim:<br><a name="68">68</a>  But chose the tribe of Judah, the mount Zion which he loved.<br><a name="69">69</a>  And he built his sanctuary like high [palaces], like the earth which he hath established for ever.<br><a name="70">70</a>  He chose David also his servant, and took him from the sheepfolds:<br><a name="71">71</a>  From following the ewes great with young he brought him to feed Jacob his people, and Israel his inheritance.<br><a name="72">72</a>  So he fed them according to the integrity of his heart; and guided them by the skilfulness of his hands.<br><br>Go to <a href="psa79.htm#1">Psalm 79</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
