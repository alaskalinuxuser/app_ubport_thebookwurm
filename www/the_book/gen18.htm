Genesis  18<br>1. And the LORD appeared unto him in the plains of Mamre: and he sat in the tent door in the heat of the day;<br><a name="2">2</a>  And he lift up his eyes and looked, and, lo, three men stood by him: and when he saw [them], he ran to meet them from the tent door, and bowed himself toward the ground,<br><a name="3">3</a>  And said, My Lord, if now I have found favour in thy sight, pass not away, I pray thee, from thy servant:<br><a name="4">4</a>  Let a little water, I pray you, be fetched, and wash your feet, and rest yourselves under the tree:<br><a name="5">5</a>  And I will fetch a morsel of bread, and comfort ye your hearts; after that ye shall pass on: for therefore are ye come to your servant. And they said, So do, as thou hast said.<br><a name="6">6</a>  And Abraham hastened into the tent unto Sarah, and said, Make ready quickly three measures of fine meal, knead [it], and make cakes upon the hearth.<br><a name="7">7</a>  And Abraham ran unto the herd, and fetcht a calf tender and good, and gave [it] unto a young man; and he hasted to dress it.<br><a name="8">8</a>  And he took butter, and milk, and the calf which he had dressed, and set [it] before them; and he stood by them under the tree, and they did eat.<br><a name="9">9</a>. And they said unto him, Where [is] Sarah thy wife? And he said, Behold, in the tent.<br><a name="10">10</a>  And he said, I will certainly return unto thee according to the time of life; and, lo, Sarah thy wife shall have a son. And Sarah heard [it] in the tent door, which [was] behind him.<br><a name="11">11</a>  Now Abraham and Sarah [were] old [and] well stricken in age; [and] it ceased to be with Sarah after the manner of women.<br><a name="12">12</a>  Therefore Sarah laughed within herself, saying, After I am waxed old shall I have pleasure, my lord being old also?<br><a name="13">13</a>  And the LORD said unto Abraham, Wherefore did Sarah laugh, saying, Shall I of a surety bear a child, which am old?<br><a name="14">14</a>  Is any thing too hard for the LORD? At the time appointed I will return unto thee, according to the time of life, and Sarah shall have a son.<br><a name="15">15</a>  Then Sarah denied, saying, I laughed not; for she was afraid. And he said, Nay; but thou didst laugh.<br><a name="16">16</a>. And the men rose up from thence, and looked toward Sodom: and Abraham went with them to bring them on the way.<br><a name="17">17</a>  And the LORD said, Shall I hide from Abraham that thing which I do;<br><a name="18">18</a>  Seeing that Abraham shall surely become a great and mighty nation, and all the nations of the earth shall be blessed in him?<br><a name="19">19</a>  For I know him, that he will command his children and his household after him, and they shall keep the way of the LORD, to do justice and judgment; that the LORD may bring upon Abraham that which he hath spoken of him.<br><a name="20">20</a>  And the LORD said, Because the cry of Sodom and Gomorrah is great, and because their sin is very grievous;<br><a name="21">21</a>  I will go down now, and see whether they have done altogether according to the cry of it, which is come unto me; and if not, I will know.<br><a name="22">22</a>  And the men turned their faces from thence, and went toward Sodom: but Abraham stood yet before the LORD.<br><a name="23">23</a>. And Abraham drew near, and said, Wilt thou also destroy the righteous with the wicked?<br><a name="24">24</a>  Peradventure there be fifty righteous within the city: wilt thou also destroy and not spare the place for the fifty righteous that [are] therein?<br><a name="25">25</a>  That be far from thee to do after this manner, to slay the righteous with the wicked: and that the righteous should be as the wicked, that be far from thee: Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right?<br><a name="26">26</a>  And the LORD said, If I find in Sodom fifty righteous within the city, then I will spare all the place for their sakes.<br><a name="27">27</a>  And Abraham answered and said, Behold now, I have taken upon me to speak unto the Lord, which [am but] dust and ashes:<br><a name="28">28</a>  Peradventure there shall lack five of the fifty righteous: wilt thou destroy all the city for [lack of] five? And he said, If I find there forty and five, I will not destroy [it].<br><a name="29">29</a>  And he spake unto him yet again, and said, Peradventure there shall be forty found there. And he said, I will not do [it] for forty's sake.<br><a name="30">30</a>  And he said [unto him], Oh let not the Lord be angry, and I will speak: Peradventure there shall thirty be found there. And he said, I will not do [it], if I find thirty there.<br><a name="31">31</a>  And he said, Behold now, I have taken upon me to speak unto the Lord: Peradventure there shall be twenty found there. And he said, I will not destroy [it] for twenty's sake.<br><a name="32">32</a>  And he said, Oh let not the Lord be angry, and I will speak yet but this once: Peradventure ten shall be found there. And he said, I will not destroy [it] for ten's sake.<br><a name="33">33</a>  And the LORD went his way, as soon as he had left communing with Abraham: and Abraham returned unto his place.<br><br>Go to <a href="gen19.htm#1">Genesis 19</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
