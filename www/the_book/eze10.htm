Ezekiel  10<br>1. Then I looked, and, behold, in the firmament that was above the head of the cherubims there appeared over them as it were a sapphire stone, as the appearance of the likeness of a throne.<br><a name="2">2</a>  And he spake unto the man clothed with linen, and said, Go in between the wheels, [even] under the cherub, and fill thine hand with coals of fire from between the cherubims, and scatter [them] over the city. And he went in in my sight.<br><a name="3">3</a>  Now the cherubims stood on the right side of the house, when the man went in; and the cloud filled the inner court.<br><a name="4">4</a>  Then the glory of the LORD went up from the cherub, [and stood] over the threshold of the house; and the house was filled with the cloud, and the court was full of the brightness of the LORD'S glory.<br><a name="5">5</a>  And the sound of the cherubims' wings was heard [even] to the outer court, as the voice of the Almighty God when he speaketh.<br><a name="6">6</a>  And it came to pass, [that] when he had commanded the man clothed with linen, saying, Take fire from between the wheels, from between the cherubims; then he went in, and stood beside the wheels.<br><a name="7">7</a>  And [one] cherub stretched forth his hand from between the cherubims unto the fire that [was] between the cherubims, and took [thereof], and put [it] into the hands of [him that was] clothed with linen: who took [it], and went out.<br><a name="8">8</a>. And there appeared in the cherubims the form of a man's hand under their wings.<br><a name="9">9</a>  And when I looked, behold the four wheels by the cherubims, one wheel by one cherub, and another wheel by another cherub: and the appearance of the wheels [was] as the colour of a beryl stone.<br><a name="10">10</a>  And [as for] their appearances, they four had one likeness, as if a wheel had been in the midst of a wheel.<br><a name="11">11</a>  When they went, they went upon their four sides; they turned not as they went, but to the place whither the head looked they followed it; they turned not as they went.<br><a name="12">12</a>  And their whole body, and their backs, and their hands, and their wings, and the wheels, [were] full of eyes round about, [even] the wheels that they four had.<br><a name="13">13</a>  As for the wheels, it was cried unto them in my hearing, O wheel.<br><a name="14">14</a>  And every one had four faces: the first face [was] the face of a cherub, and the second face [was] the face of a man, and the third the face of a lion, and the fourth the face of an eagle.<br><a name="15">15</a>  And the cherubims were lifted up. This [is] the living creature that I saw by the river of Chebar.<br><a name="16">16</a>  And when the cherubims went, the wheels went by them: and when the cherubims lifted up their wings to mount up from the earth, the same wheels also turned not from beside them.<br><a name="17">17</a>  When they stood, [these] stood; and when they were lifted up, [these] lifted up themselves [also]: for the spirit of the living creature [was] in them.<br><a name="18">18</a>  Then the glory of the LORD departed from off the threshold of the house, and stood over the cherubims.<br><a name="19">19</a>  And the cherubims lifted up their wings, and mounted up from the earth in my sight: when they went out, the wheels also [were] beside them, and [every one] stood at the door of the east gate of the LORD'S house; and the glory of the God of Israel [was] over them above.<br><a name="20">20</a>  This [is] the living creature that I saw under the God of Israel by the river of Chebar; and I knew that they [were] the cherubims.<br><a name="21">21</a>  Every one had four faces apiece, and every one four wings; and the likeness of the hands of a man [was] under their wings.<br><a name="22">22</a>  And the likeness of their faces [was] the same faces which I saw by the river of Chebar, their appearances and themselves: they went every one straight forward.<br><br>Go to <a href="eze11.htm#1">Ezekiel 11</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
