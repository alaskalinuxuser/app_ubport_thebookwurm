Job  32<br>1. So these three men ceased to answer Job, because he [was] righteous in his own eyes.<br><a name="2">2</a>  Then was kindled the wrath of Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite, of the kindred of Ram: against Job was his wrath kindled, because he justified himself rather than God.<br><a name="3">3</a>  Also against his three friends was his wrath kindled, because they had found no answer, and [yet] had condemned Job.<br><a name="4">4</a>  Now Elihu had waited till Job had spoken, because they [were] elder than he.<br><a name="5">5</a>  When Elihu saw that [there was] no answer in the mouth of [these] three men, then his wrath was kindled.<br><a name="6">6</a>. And Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite answered and said, I [am] young, and ye [are] very old; wherefore I was afraid, and durst not shew you mine opinion.<br><a name="7">7</a>  I said, Days should speak, and multitude of years should teach wisdom.<br><a name="8">8</a>  But [there is] a spirit in man: and the inspiration of the Almighty giveth them understanding.<br><a name="9">9</a>  Great men are not [always] wise: neither do the aged understand judgment.<br><a name="10">10</a>  Therefore I said, Hearken to me; I also will shew mine opinion.<br><a name="11">11</a>  Behold, I waited for your words; I gave ear to your reasons, whilst ye searched out what to say.<br><a name="12">12</a>  Yea, I attended unto you, and, behold, [there was] none of you that convinced Job, [or] that answered his words:<br><a name="13">13</a>  Lest ye should say, We have found out wisdom: God thrusteth him down, not man.<br><a name="14">14</a>  Now he hath not directed [his] words against me: neither will I answer him with your speeches.<br><a name="15">15</a>. They were amazed, they answered no more: they left off speaking.<br><a name="16">16</a>  When I had waited, (for they spake not, but stood still, [and] answered no more;)<br><a name="17">17</a>  [I said], I will answer also my part, I also will shew mine opinion.<br><a name="18">18</a>  For I am full of matter, the spirit within me constraineth me.<br><a name="19">19</a>  Behold, my belly [is] as wine [which] hath no vent; it is ready to burst like new bottles.<br><a name="20">20</a>  I will speak, that I may be refreshed: I will open my lips and answer.<br><a name="21">21</a>  Let me not, I pray you, accept any man's person, neither let me give flattering titles unto man.<br><a name="22">22</a>  For I know not to give flattering titles; [in so doing] my maker would soon take me away.<br><br>Go to <a href="job33.htm#1">Job 33</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
