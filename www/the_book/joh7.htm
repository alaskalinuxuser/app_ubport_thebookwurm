After these things Jesus walked in Galilee: for he would not walk in Jewry, because the Jews sought to kill him.<br><a name="2">2</a>  Now the Jews' feast of tabernacles was at hand.<br><a name="3">3</a>  His brethren therefore said unto him, Depart hence, and go into Judaea, that thy disciples also may see the works that thou doest.<br><a name="4">4</a>  For [there is] no man [that] doeth any thing in secret, and he himself seeketh to be known openly. If thou do these things, shew thyself to the world.<br><a name="5">5</a>  For neither did his brethren believe in him.<br><a name="6">6</a>  Then Jesus said unto them, My time is not yet come: but your time is alway ready.<br><a name="7">7</a>  The world cannot hate you; but me it hateth, because I testify of it, that the works thereof are evil.<br><a name="8">8</a>  Go ye up unto this feast: I go not up yet unto this feast; for my time is not yet full come.<br><a name="9">9</a>  When he had said these words unto them, he abode [still] in Galilee.<br><a name="10">10</a>  But when his brethren were gone up, then went he also up unto the feast, not openly, but as it were in secret.<br><a name="11">11</a>  Then the Jews sought him at the feast, and said, Where is he?<br><a name="12">12</a>  And there was much murmuring among the people concerning him: for some said, He is a good man: others said, Nay; but he deceiveth the people.<br><a name="13">13</a>  Howbeit no man spake openly of him for fear of the Jews.<br><a name="14">14</a>. Now about the midst of the feast Jesus went up into the temple, and taught.<br><a name="15">15</a>  And the Jews marvelled, saying, How knoweth this man letters, having never learned?<br><a name="16">16</a>  Jesus answered them, and said, My doctrine is not mine, but his that sent me.<br><a name="17">17</a>  If any man will do his will, he shall know of the doctrine, whether it be of God, or [whether] I speak of myself.<br><a name="18">18</a>  He that speaketh of himself seeketh his own glory: but he that seeketh his glory that sent him, the same is true, and no unrighteousness is in him.<br><a name="19">19</a>  Did not Moses give you the law, and [yet] none of you keepeth the law? Why go ye about to kill me?<br><a name="20">20</a>  The people answered and said, Thou hast a devil: who goeth about to kill thee?<br><a name="21">21</a>  Jesus answered and said unto them, I have done one work, and ye all marvel.<br><a name="22">22</a>  Moses therefore gave unto you circumcision; (not because it is of Moses, but of the fathers;) and ye on the sabbath day circumcise a man.<br><a name="23">23</a>  If a man on the sabbath day receive circumcision, that the law of Moses should not be broken; are ye angry at me, because I have made a man every whit whole on the sabbath day?<br><a name="24">24</a>  Judge not according to the appearance, but judge righteous judgment.<br><a name="25">25</a>  Then said some of them of Jerusalem, Is not this he, whom they seek to kill?<br><a name="26">26</a>  But, lo, he speaketh boldly, and they say nothing unto him. Do the rulers know indeed that this is the very Christ?<br><a name="27">27</a>  Howbeit we know this man whence he is: but when Christ cometh, no man knoweth whence he is.<br><a name="28">28</a>  Then cried Jesus in the temple as he taught, saying, Ye both know me, and ye know whence I am: and I am not come of myself, but he that sent me is true, whom ye know not.<br><a name="29">29</a>  But I know him: for I am from him, and he hath sent me.<br><a name="30">30</a>  Then they sought to take him: but no man laid hands on him, because his hour was not yet come.<br><a name="31">31</a>  And many of the people believed on him, and said, When Christ cometh, will he do more miracles than these which this [man] hath done?<br><a name="32">32</a>  The Pharisees heard that the people murmured such things concerning him; and the Pharisees and the chief priests sent officers to take him.<br><a name="33">33</a>  Then said Jesus unto them, Yet a little while am I with you, and [then] I go unto him that sent me.<br><a name="34">34</a>  Ye shall seek me, and shall not find [me]: and where I am, [thither] ye cannot come.<br><a name="35">35</a>  Then said the Jews among themselves, Whither will he go, that we shall not find him? will he go unto the dispersed among the Gentiles, and teach the Gentiles?<br><a name="36">36</a>  What [manner of] saying is this that he said, Ye shall seek me, and shall not find [me]: and where I am, [thither] ye cannot come?<br><a name="37">37</a>. In the last day, that great [day] of the feast, Jesus stood and cried, saying, If any man thirst, let him come unto me, and drink.<br><a name="38">38</a>  He that believeth on me, as the scripture hath said, out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water.<br><a name="39">39</a>  (But this spake he of the Spirit, which they that believe on him should receive: for the Holy Ghost was not yet [given]; because that Jesus was not yet glorified.)<br><a name="40">40</a>  Many of the people therefore, when they heard this saying, said, Of a truth this is the Prophet.<br><a name="41">41</a>  Others said, This is the Christ. But some said, Shall Christ come out of Galilee?<br><a name="42">42</a>  Hath not the scripture said, That Christ cometh of the seed of David, and out of the town of Bethlehem, where David was?<br><a name="43">43</a>  So there was a division among the people because of him.<br><a name="44">44</a>  And some of them would have taken him; but no man laid hands on him.<br><a name="45">45</a>. Then came the officers to the chief priests and Pharisees; and they said unto them, Why have ye not brought him?<br><a name="46">46</a>  The officers answered, Never man spake like this man.<br><a name="47">47</a>  Then answered them the Pharisees, Are ye also deceived?<br><a name="48">48</a>  Have any of the rulers or of the Pharisees believed on him?<br><a name="49">49</a>  But this people who knoweth not the law are cursed.<br><a name="50">50</a>  Nicodemus saith unto them, (he that came to Jesus by night, being one of them,)<br><a name="51">51</a>  Doth our law judge [any] man, before it hear him, and know what he doeth?<br><a name="52">52</a>  They answered and said unto him, Art thou also of Galilee? Search, and look: for out of Galilee ariseth no prophet.<br><a name="53">53</a>  And every man went unto his own house.<br><br>Go to <a href="joh8.htm#1">John 8</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
