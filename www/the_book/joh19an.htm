<i><b>19:1. Then Pilate therefore took Jesus, and scourged [him].<br>
19:2  And the soldiers platted a crown of thorns, and put [it] on his head,<br>
and they put on him a purple robe,<br>
19:3  And said, Hail, King of the Jews!<br>
and they smote him with their hands.</b></i></dt><dl>
<dt>Pilate therefore...- Pilate thought he might appease the Jews with a little blood, and release Jesus.<dd>cp. <a href="mar15.htm#15">Mark 15:15</a>; <a href="luk23.htm#16">Luk 23:16</a>
<dt>...scourged Him- An innocent man (<a href="joh18.htm#38">18:38</a>) should not have been scourged. 
<dd>But this was in fulfilment of prophecy. cp. <a href="isa50.htm#6">Isa 50:6</a>; <a href="isa53.htm#5">53:5</a>
<dt>a crown... a purple robe... 'Hail, King...'- 
<dd>Each of the elements of their mockery resonated with the Truth. <a href="joh18.htm#37">18:37</a>
<dt>thorns...- He took the curse upon Himself. cp. <a href="gen3.htm#17">Gen 3:17,18</a>; <a href="2cor5.htm#21">2Cor 5:21</a>; <a href="gal3.htm#13">Gal 3:13</a>
<dt>they smote Him with their hands.-<dd>Roman soldiers were known to play a cruel game, where the blindfolded prisoner was struck repeatedly until he guessed which soldier had not struck with his fists. Some prisoners did not survive such abuse (cp. <a href="luk22.htm#64">Luk 22:64</a>). Yet, Jesus, who knows what is in man, knew their names. How did He respond? <a href="isa53.htm#7">Isa 53:7</a></dl><dt>
<i><b>19:4  Pilate therefore went forth again, and saith unto them,<br>
Behold, I bring him forth to you, that ye may know that I find no fault in him.<br>
19:5  Then came Jesus forth, wearing the crown of thorns, and the purple robe.<br>
And [Pilate] saith unto them, Behold the man!</b></i></dt><dl>
<dt>Behold the man...- He was beaten nearly beyond recognition. <a href="isa52.htm#14">Isa 52:14</a>; cp. <a href="joh1.htm#29">Joh 1:29</a>
<dt>I find no fault in him.- fault- GK= aitia, cause, crime, reason for punishment.

<i><b>19:6  When the chief priests therefore and officers saw him, they cried out,<br>
saying, Crucify [him], crucify [him]. </b></i>{<a href="mat27.htm#24">Mat 27:24</a>}<i><b><br>
Pilate saith unto them, Take ye him, and crucify [him]: for I find no fault in him.<br>
19:7  The Jews answered him,<br>
We have a law, and by our law he ought to die, because he made himself the Son of God.</b></i></dt><dl>
<dt>by our law he ought to die.- cp. <a href="joh8.htm#58">8:58.59</a>; <a href="joh10.htm#30">10:30-33</a>; <a href="mat26.htm#65">Mat 26:65,66</a>
<dd>According to Roman law, Jesus was not worthy of death.
<dd>The Jewish leaders finally resort to their underlying accusation of &quot;blasphemy.&quot;
<dt>he made himself the Son of God.- This phrase aggravates Pilate's superstitious fears. cp. <a href="mat27.htm#19">Mat 27:19</a></dl><dt>
<i><b>19:8  When Pilate therefore heard that saying, he was the more afraid;<br>
19:9  And went again into the judgment hall, and saith unto Jesus, Whence art thou?<br>
But Jesus gave him no answer. </b></i>{<a href="isa53.htm#7">Isa 53:7</a>}<i><b><br>
19:10  Then saith Pilate unto him, Speakest thou not unto me?<br>
knowest thou not that I have power to crucify thee, and have power to release thee?<br>
19:11  Jesus answered, Thou couldest have no power [at all] against me,<br>
except it were given thee from above:<br>
therefore he that delivered me unto thee hath the greater sin.<br>
19:12  And from thenceforth Pilate sought to release him: </b></i></dt><dl>
<dt>Jesus spoke, but not in self-defense. Rather, as the Truth, He corrects Pilate's error.-<ul>
<li>Yes. Pilate had been given authority to exercise justice, and would be held responsible.<br>cp. <a href="rom13.htm#1">Rom 13:1</a>; <a href="1cor2.htm#8">1Cor 2:8</a>
<li>No. Pilate had no power to act &quot;against me&quot; (cp. <a href="joh10.htm#18">10:18</a>) except as allowed by God (<a href="act4.htm#27">Acts 4:27,28</a>).</ul>
<dt>he that delivered me unto thee hath the greater sin-
<dd>- - Judas delivered Jesus to Caiaphas (<a href="joh18.htm#3">18:3,12,13</a>).<br>
- - Caiaphas delivered Jesus to Pilate (<a href="joh18.htm#28">18:28,29</a>).
<dd>&quot;Pilate was guilty of the sin of refusing justice to his innocent prisoner, but Caiaphas was guilty of the greater sin of the death of Christ, for he sinned against a Bible knowledge to which Pilate was a stranger.&quot; [GWms] cp. <a href="rom3.htm#1">Rom 3:1-4</a>
<dd>NOTE: Although the Jewish leadership was implicated in the death of the Messiah, it is a grave error to call the Jews &quot;Christ killers&quot; as the enemies of Israel have done ever since.<br>Remember that: <ol type="A"><li>The responsibility for the crucifixion of Jesus is shared equally by Jews and Gentiles. It would not have occurred without the participation of both groups.<li>Jesus forgave those responsible, even as He was being crucified. <a href="luk23.htm#34">Luke 23:34</a><li>Every true Christian acknowledges his personal guilt in Christ's death, for we believe that &quot;Christ died for <i>our</i> sins&quot; (<a href="1cor15.htm#3">1Cor 15:3</a>).</ol>
<dt>from thenceforth, Pilate sought to release him.-<ul>
<li>because he knew Jesus was innocent, not because he believed in Him.
<li>because he was under conviction by the Truth, and tormented by his superstitions (<a href="joh19.htm#7" target="lwr_lt">v.7,8</a>).</ul></dl><dt>
<i><b>but the Jews cried out, saying, If thou let this man go, thou art not Caesar's friend:<br>
whosoever maketh himself a king speaketh against Caesar. </b></i>{cp. <a href="luk23.htm#2">Luk 23:2</a>}<i><b><br>
19:13  When Pilate therefore heard that saying, he brought Jesus forth,<br>
and sat down in the judgment seat in a place that is called the Pavement, but in the Hebrew, Gabbatha.</b></i></dt><dl>
<dt>Pilate... in the judgment seat...- Decision time has come. 
<dd>But it is Pilate, not Jesus, who is on trial. cp. <a href="deu1.htm#17">Deu 1:17</a>; <a href="1sam15.htm#24">1Sam 15:24</a>; <a href="pro29.htm#25">Prov 29:25</a>; <a href="isa51.htm#12">Isa 51:12,13</a>

<i><b>19:14  And it was the preparation of the passover, and about the sixth hour:<br>

Pilate saith unto them, Shall I crucify your King?<br>
The chief priests answered, We have no king but Caesar.</b></i></dt><dl>
<dt>The Jewish leaders are also confronted with a final choice concerning their King.-
<dd>cp. <a href="gen49.htm#10">Gen 49:10</a>; <a href="jer10.htm#10">Jer 10:10</a>; <a href="luk19.htm#38">Luk 19:38</a>; <a href="joh12.htm#13">Joh 12:13</a>
<dt>We have no king but Caesar.- Having rejected their Messiah, 
<dd>they align themselves with 'the people of the prince that shall come' (ie., the future Roman antichrist). cp. <a href="dan9.htm#26">Dan 9:26</a>; <a href="joh5.htm#43">Joh 5:43</a>
<dt>the preparation of the passover - 
<dd>This phrase may be a specific reference to any of the following:<ol type="a">
<li>the day of Passover- Jesus died as the Passover Lamb on Passover.
<li>the day of preparation for the Week of Passover (the 7 day Feast of Unleavened Bread), 
which began on the day following the day of Passover. cp. <a href="luk22.htm#1">Luk 22:1,7</a>; <a href="ex12.htm#15">Ex 12:15,16</a>; <a href="lev23.htm#5">Lev 23:5-7</a>
<li>the day of preparation for the Sabbath- cp. <a href="mat27.htm#62">Mat 27:62</a>; <a href="mar15.htm#42">Mark 15:42</a>; <a href="luk23.htm#54">Luk 23:54</a>; <a href="joh19.htm#14" target="lwr_lt">Joh 19:14,31,42</a><br>
If Passover occurred on a Friday, the following day would naturally be the sabbath. But this sabbath was a special (high) day (<a href="joh19.htm#31" target="lwr_lt">v.31</a>). The day of Passover itself was regarded as a sabbath. But the following day, the first day of Unleavened Bread was a 'holy convocation' unto the Lord.</ol>(Actually, all of the above possibilities refer to the same day.)
<dt>about the sixth hour- or approximately 6 a.m.
<dd>John appears to use Roman time (counting 12 hours from midnight, or from noon, as we do today).<br>
The other gospels appear to use Hebrew time (counting from sunrise, about 6 a.m. by our clocks). By Hebrew reckoning, the sixth hour would be about noon. However, Jesus was crucified at 9 a.m. (<a href="mar15.htm#25">Mark 15:25</a>); darkness fell from noon to 3 p.m. (<a href="mat27.htm#45">Mat 27:45,46</a>; <a href="mar15.htm#33">Mark 15:33,34</a>; <a href="luk23.htm#44">Luk 23:44</a>).

<i><b>19:16  Then delivered he him therefore unto them to be crucified.<br>
And they took Jesus, and led [him] away.</b></i>
<dd>cp. <a href="isa53.htm#8">Isa 53:8</a>, &quot;He was taken from judgment...&quot; ie., He was refused justice. [GWms]<dt>
<i><b>19:17  And he bearing his cross went forth into a place called [the place] of a skull,<br>

<dt>he...went forth..., the place...was near to the city.-
<dd>He was crucified outside the city. cp. <a href="lev4.htm#12">Lev 4:12</a>; <a href="heb13.htm#11">Heb 13:11-13</a></dl><dt>
<i><b>19:19  And Pilate wrote a title, and put [it] on the cross. And the writing was,<br>

19:21  Then said the chief priests of the Jews to Pilate,<br>
Write not, The King of the Jews; but that he said, I am King of the Jews.<br>
19:22  Pilate answered, What I have written I have written.</b></i></dt><dl>
<dt>Pilate's words, though written with cynicism and animosity, declare the Truth.
<dd>Both Pilate and the Jewish leaders will be judged by the rejected One.<dt><dt>
<b>The Cross from various viewpoints -</b> [adapted from McGee]<dd><ul>
<li>to God - - a propitiation. <a href="rom3.htm#24">Rom 3:24,25</a>
<dd>The place of judgment upon sin becomes the place of mercy for the sinner.<dt>
<li>to Jesus - - an act of obedience. <a href="php2.htm#8">Php 2:8</a>
<dd>- - His one sacrifice for sin. <a href="heb9.htm#14">Heb 9:14,28</a>; <a href="heb10.htm#10">10:10,12,14</a><dt>
<li>to believers - - a substitution.
<dd>The sinless One suffered in the place of the sinner. <a href="1pet2.htm#24">1Pet 2:24</a>; <a href="2cor5.htm#21">2Cor 5:21</a><dt>
<li>to Satan - - a temporary triumph. <a href="gen3.htm#15">Gen 3:15</a> (the <i>bruised</i> heel)
<dd>- - a permanent defeat. <a href="gen3.htm#15">Gen 3:15</a> (the <i>crushed</i> head); <a href="heb2.htm#14">Heb 2:14</a>; <a href="rom16.htm#20">Rom 16:20</a><dt>
<li>to the world - - nothing but a brutal murder, an injustice to a man named Jesus.</ul></dl><dt>
<i><b>19:23  Then the soldiers, when they had crucified Jesus,<br>
took his garments, and made four parts, to every soldier a part;<br>
and also [his] coat: now the coat was without seam, woven from the top throughout.<br>
19:24  They said therefore among themselves,<br>
Let us not rend it, but cast lots for it, whose it shall be:<br>
that the scripture might be fulfilled, which saith,<br>
They parted my raiment among them, and for my vesture they did cast lots. </i></b>{<a href="psa22.htm#18">Psa 22:18</a>}<b><i><br>
These things therefore the soldiers did.</b></i></dt><dl>
<dt>The Gospel writers do not provide great detail regarding Jesus' sufferings on the cross.
<dd>God has covered it in darkness. What transpired there was a transaction between the Father and the Son... &quot;a transaction for the sins of the world, which is beyond our comprehension.&quot; [in quotes, McGee]
<dt><a href="psa22.htm#1">Psalm 22</a> provides the clearest insight into the exercises of His soul on the cross.
<dt>The gospels record Seven Sayings of Jesus from the cross. John includes three.
<dd>All 7 can be found in Psalm 22. (See the <i> Book Notes</i>: <a href="psm_menu.htm" target="lwr_lt">Psalms of the Messiah</a> on <b>Psalm 22</b>.)
<dd>The order is:<ol type="1"><li>&quot;Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do.&quot; <a href="luk23.htm#34">Luk 23:34</a><li>&quot;Today shalt thou be with me in paradise.&quot; <a href="luk23.htm#43">Luk 23:43</a><li>&quot;Woman, behold thy son...&quot; <a href="joh19.htm#26" target="lwr_lt">Joh 19:26,27</a><li>&quot;My God, My God, Why hast thou forsaken me?&quot; <a href="mat27.htm#46">Mat 27:46</a><li>&quot;I thirst...&quot; <a href="joh19.htm#28" target="lwr_lt">Joh 19:28</a><li>&quot;It is finished.&quot; <a href="joh19.htm#30" target="lwr_lt">Joh 19:30</a><li>&quot;Father, into thy hands I commend my spirit.&quot; <a href="luk23.htm#46">Luk 23:46</a></ol></dl><dt>
<i><b>19:25  Now there stood by the cross of Jesus his mother, and his mother's sister,<br>
Mary the [wife] of Cleophas, and Mary Magdalene.<br>
19:26  When Jesus therefore saw his mother </b></i>{cp. <a href="luk2.htm#34">Luk 2:34,35</a>}<b><i>,<br>
and the disciple standing by, whom he loved </b></i>{ie., John}<i><b>,<br>
he saith unto his mother, Woman, behold thy son!<br>
19:27  Then saith he to the disciple, Behold thy mother!<br>
And from that hour that disciple took her unto his own [home].</b></i></dt><dl>
<dt>Woman, behold thy son- she was to regard John as her son now.<ul>
<li>Jesus tenderly made arrangements for Mary's care.<dd>
Mary was among the women who were traveling with Jesus (cp. <a href="mat27.htm#55">Mat 27:55,56</a>).</dd><dd>
Since Mary's other children (cp. <a href="mar6.htm#3">Mark 6:3</a>) were still in unbelief (<a href="joh7.htm#3">Joh 7:3-5</a>), perhaps they had remained in Galilee and were unavailable to care for her. After His resurrection, his brothers believed and were with their mother (<a href="act1.htm#14">Acts 1:14</a>). Regarding Jesus' appointment of John to be a son to His mother, see <a href="mat12.htm#48">Mat 12:48-50</a>.</dd>
<li>Jesus announced her new relationship to Him.<dd>
Earlier, Mary's motherly authority over her son had ended as He entered His ministry. cp. <a href="joh2.htm#4">2:4</a></dd><dd>
Now, that His 'hour' had come, her relationship to Him as mother to son had come to an end. No longer would she know Him after the flesh. From that time onward, she, like every believer, would know Him as the glorified Christ. cp. <a href="2cor5.htm#16">2Cor 5:16</a></dd></ul></dl><dt>
<i><b>19:28  After this, Jesus<br>
knowing that all things were now accomplished, that the scripture might be fulfilled,<br>
saith, I thirst.<br>
19:29  Now there was set a vessel full of vinegar: and they filled a spunge with vinegar,<br>
and put [it] upon hyssop, and put [it] to his mouth.<br>
19:30  When Jesus therefore had received the vinegar, he said,<br>
It is finished:<br>

<dt>I thirst.-
<dd>Soon after the soldiers had nailed Him to the cross, they offered Him a drink of vinegar (sour wine) and gall (perhaps myrrh) (<a href="mat27.htm#33">Mat 27:33,34</a>). Jesus had refused that drink and its stupefying effect. He must remain alert to do the work which the Father had committed to Him. Only after He knew that His work was accomplished would He allow some relief to His physical thirst.<ul>
<li>He thirsted physically.- <a href="psa22.htm#15">Psa 22:15 </a>
<li>He thirsted spiritually.- <a href="psa22.htm#1">Psa 22:1,2</a>; <a href="mat27.htm#45">Mat 27:45-48</a><br>

<dd>Ancient tax receipts have been found with this one word written across them, meaning:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Paid in full.&quot;

19:37  And again another scripture saith,<br>

<dt>that their legs might be broken- Death by crucifixion came slowly (sometimes in a matter of days).
<dd>The victim struggled between excruciating pain and the need to raise himself to take a breath. Death came when the exhausted victim, no longer able to raise himself, suffocated. To speed the process, a victim's legs were broken.
<dt>blood and water- What is the significance of this? Some possibilities:<ol type="a">
<li>Jesus may have died of a broken heart,<dd>as indicated by the peracardium full of blood and serum. [TBKC]</dd>
<li>Jesus was truly human (not a spirit entity that only appeared to be a man).<dd>John may have been purposely answering heresies which taught that Jesus was not fully man. [TBKC]</dd>
<li>Symbolically, Jesus is the source of the stream of healing and cleansing from sin and its consequences. cp. <a href="zech13.htm#1">Zech 13:1</a>.<dd>The remission of sin is on the basis of blood (signifying the death of the flesh; <a href="rom3.htm#25">Rom 3:25</a>; <a href="heb9.htm#22">Heb 9:22</a>).</dd><dd>Cleansing from incidental sin is symbolized by the washing of water (<a href="eph5.htm#26">Eph 5:26</a>).</dd>
<li>Jesus was truly dead, before being placed in the tomb.<dd>(Therefore, the resurrection was from death, not from a swoon.)</dd>
<li>Jesus, even in His death, satisfied the scriptural prophecies regarding the Messiah.</ol> 
<dt>that the scripture should be fulfilled... 'A bone... shall not be broken.'- (quoting <a href="psa34.htm#20">Psa 34:20</a>).
<dd>Also see <a href="ex12.htm#46">Ex 12:46</a>; <a href="num9.htm#12">Num 9:12</a> (regarding the Passover Lamb).
