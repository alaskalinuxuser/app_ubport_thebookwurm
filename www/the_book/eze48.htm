and the sanctuary of the house [shall be] in the midst thereof.<br><a name="22">22</a>  Moreover from the possession of the Levites, and from the possession of the city, [being] in the midst [of that] which is the prince's, between the border of Judah and the border of Benjamin, shall be for the prince.<br><a name="23">23</a>  As for the rest of the tribes, from the east side unto the west side, Benjamin [shall have] a [portion].<br><a name="24">24</a>  And by the border of Benjamin, from the east side unto the west side, Simeon [shall have] a [portion].<br><a name="25">25</a>  And by the border of Simeon, from the east side unto the west side, Issachar a [portion].<br><a name="26">26</a>  And by the border of Issachar, from the east side unto the west side, Zebulun a [portion].<br><a name="27">27</a>  And by the border of Zebulun, from the east side unto the west side, Gad a [portion].<br><a name="28">28</a>  And by the border of Gad, at the south side southward, the border shall be even from Tamar [unto] the waters of strife [in] Kadesh, [and] to the river toward the great sea.<br><a name="29">29</a>  This [is] the land which ye shall divide by lot unto the tribes of Israel for inheritance, and these [are] their portions, saith the Lord GOD.<br><a name="30">30</a>  And these [are] the goings out of the city on the north side, four thousand and five hundred measures.<br><a name="31">31</a>. And the gates of the city [shall be] after the names of the tribes of Israel: three gates northward; one gate of Reuben, one gate of Judah, one gate of Levi.<br><a name="32">32</a>  And at the east side four thousand and five hundred: and three gates; and one gate of Joseph, one gate of Benjamin, one gate of Dan.<br><a name="33">33</a>  And at the south side four thousand and five hundred measures: and three gates; one gate of Simeon, one gate of Issachar, one gate of Zebulun.<br><a name="34">34</a>  At the west side four thousand and five hundred, [with] their three gates; one gate of Gad, one gate of Asher, one gate of Naphtali.<br><a name="35">35</a>  [It was] round about eighteen thousand [measures]: and the name of the city from [that] day [shall be], The LORD [is] there.<br><br>End of Ezekiel.<br>Go to <a href="dan1.htm#1">Daniel 1</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
