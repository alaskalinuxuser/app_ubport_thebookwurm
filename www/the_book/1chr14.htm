1Chronicles  14<br>1. Now Hiram king of Tyre sent messengers to David, and timber of cedars, with masons and carpenters, to build him an house.<br><a name="2">2</a>  And David perceived that the LORD had confirmed him king over Israel, for his kingdom was lifted up on high, because of his people Israel.<br><a name="3">3</a>  And David took more wives at Jerusalem: and David begat more sons and daughters.<br><a name="4">4</a>  Now these [are] the names of [his] children which he had in Jerusalem; Shammua, and Shobab, Nathan, and Solomon,<br><a name="5">5</a>  And Ibhar, and Elishua, and Elpalet,<br><a name="6">6</a>  And Nogah, and Nepheg, and Japhia,<br><a name="7">7</a>  And Elishama, and Beeliada, and Eliphalet.<br><a name="8">8</a>. And when the Philistines heard that David was anointed king over all Israel, all the Philistines went up to seek David. And David heard [of it], and went out against them.<br><a name="9">9</a>  And the Philistines came and spread themselves in the valley of Rephaim.<br><a name="10">10</a>  And David enquired of God, saying, Shall I go up against the Philistines? and wilt thou deliver them into mine hand? And the LORD said unto him, Go up; for I will deliver them into thine hand.<br><a name="11">11</a>  So they came up to Baalperazim; and David smote them there. Then David said, God hath broken in upon mine enemies by mine hand like the breaking forth of waters: therefore they called the name of that place Baalperazim.<br><a name="12">12</a>  And when they had left their gods there, David gave a commandment, and they were burned with fire.<br><a name="13">13</a>  And the Philistines yet again spread themselves abroad in the valley.<br><a name="14">14</a>  Therefore David enquired again of God; and God said unto him, Go not up after them; turn away from them, and come upon them over against the mulberry trees.<br><a name="15">15</a>  And it shall be, when thou shalt hear a sound of going in the tops of the mulberry trees, [that] then thou shalt go out to battle: for God is gone forth before thee to smite the host of the Philistines.<br><a name="16">16</a>  David therefore did as God commanded him: and they smote the host of the Philistines from Gibeon even to Gazer.<br><a name="17">17</a>  And the fame of David went out into all lands; and the LORD brought the fear of him upon all nations.<br><br>Go to <a href="1chr15.htm#1">I Chronicles 15</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
