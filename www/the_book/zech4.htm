Zechariah   4<br>1. And the angel that talked with me came again, and waked me, as a man that is wakened out of his sleep,<br><a name="2">2</a>  And said unto me, What seest thou? And I said, I have looked, and behold a candlestick all [of] gold, with a bowl upon the top of it, and his seven lamps thereon, and seven pipes to the seven lamps, which [are] upon the top thereof:<br><a name="3">3</a>  And two olive trees by it, one upon the right [side] of the bowl, and the other upon the left [side] thereof.<br><a name="4">4</a>  So I answered and spake to the angel that talked with me, saying, What [are] these, my lord?<br><a name="5">5</a>  Then the angel that talked with me answered and said unto me, Knowest thou not what these be? And I said, No, my lord.<br><a name="6">6</a>  Then he answered and spake unto me, saying, This [is] the word of the LORD unto Zerubbabel, saying, Not by might, nor by power, but by my spirit, saith the LORD of hosts.<br><a name="7">7</a>  Who [art] thou, O great mountain? before Zerubbabel [thou shalt become] a plain: and he shall bring forth the headstone [thereof with] shoutings, [crying], Grace, grace unto it.<br><a name="8">8</a>  Moreover the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,<br><a name="9">9</a>  The hands of Zerubbabel have laid the foundation of this house; his hands shall also finish it; and thou shalt know that the LORD of hosts hath sent me unto you.<br><a name="10">10</a>  For who hath despised the day of small things? for they shall rejoice, and shall see the plummet in the hand of Zerubbabel [with] those seven; they [are] the eyes of the LORD, which run to and fro through the whole earth.<br><a name="11">11</a>. Then answered I, and said unto him, What [are] these two olive trees upon the right [side] of the candlestick and upon the left [side] thereof?<br><a name="12">12</a>  And I answered again, and said unto him, What [be these] two olive branches which through the two golden pipes empty the golden [oil] out of themselves?<br><a name="13">13</a>  And he answered me and said, Knowest thou not what these [be]? And I said, No, my lord.<br><a name="14">14</a>  Then said he, These [are] the two anointed ones, that stand by the Lord of the whole earth.<br><br>Go to <a href="zech5.htm#1">Zechariah 5</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
