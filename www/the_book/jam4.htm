[come they] not hence, [even] of your lusts that war in your members?<br><a name="2">2</a>  Ye lust, and have not: ye kill, and desire to have, and cannot obtain: ye fight and war, yet ye have not, because ye ask not.<br><a name="3">3</a>  Ye ask, and receive not, because ye ask amiss, that ye may consume [it] upon your lusts.<br><a name="4">4</a>  Ye adulterers and adulteresses, know ye not that the friendship of the world is enmity with God? whosoever therefore will be a friend of the world is the enemy of God.<br><a name="5">5</a>  Do ye think that the scripture saith in vain, The spirit that dwelleth in us lusteth to envy?<br><a name="6">6</a>  But he giveth more grace. Wherefore he saith, God resisteth the proud, but giveth grace unto the humble.<br><a name="7">7</a>  Submit yourselves therefore to God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you.<br><a name="8">8</a>  Draw nigh to God, and he will draw nigh to you. Cleanse [your] hands, [ye] sinners; and purify [your] hearts, [ye] double minded.<br><a name="9">9</a>  Be afflicted, and mourn, and weep: let your laughter be turned to mourning, and [your] joy to heaviness.<br><a name="10">10</a>  Humble yourselves in the sight of the Lord, and he shall lift you up.<br><a name="11">11</a>. Speak not evil one of another, brethren. He that speaketh evil of [his] brother, and judgeth his brother, speaketh evil of the law, and judgeth the law: but if thou judge the law, thou art not a doer of the law, but a judge.<br><a name="12">12</a>  There is one lawgiver, who is able to save and to destroy: who art thou that judgest another?<br><a name="13">13</a>  Go to now, ye that say, To day or to morrow we will go into such a city, and continue there a year, and buy and sell, and get gain:<br><a name="14">14</a>  Whereas ye know not what [shall be] on the morrow. For what [is] your life? It is even a vapour, that appeareth for a little time, and then vanisheth away.<br><a name="15">15</a>  For that ye [ought] to say, If the Lord will, we shall live, and do this, or that.<br><a name="16">16</a>  But now ye rejoice in your boastings: all such rejoicing is evil.<br><a name="17"></a> 17  Therefore to him that knoweth to do good, and doeth [it] not, to him it is sin.<br><br>Go to <a href="jam5.htm#1">James 5</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
