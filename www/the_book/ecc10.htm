Ecclesiastes  10<br>1. Dead flies cause the ointment of the apothecary to send forth a stinking savour: [so doth] a little folly him that is in reputation for wisdom [and] honour.<br><a name="2">2</a>  A wise man's heart [is] at his right hand; but a fool's heart at his left.<br><a name="3">3</a>  Yea also, when he that is a fool walketh by the way, his wisdom faileth [him], and he saith to every one [that] he [is] a fool.<br><a name="4">4</a>. If the spirit of the ruler rise up against thee, leave not thy place; for yielding pacifieth great offences.<br><a name="5">5</a>  There is an evil [which] I have seen under the sun, as an error [which] proceedeth from the ruler:<br><a name="6">6</a>  Folly is set in great dignity, and the rich sit in low place.<br><a name="7">7</a>  I have seen servants upon horses, and princes walking as servants upon the earth.<br><a name="8">8</a>  He that diggeth a pit shall fall into it; and whoso breaketh an hedge, a serpent shall bite him.<br><a name="9">9</a>  Whoso removeth stones shall be hurt therewith; [and] he that cleaveth wood shall be endangered thereby.<br><a name="10">10</a>  If the iron be blunt, and he do not whet the edge, then must he put to more strength: but wisdom [is] profitable to direct.<br><a name="11">11</a>  Surely the serpent will bite without enchantment; and a babbler is no better.<br><a name="12">12</a>. The words of a wise man's mouth [are] gracious; but the lips of a fool will swallow up himself.<br><a name="13">13</a>  The beginning of the words of his mouth [is] foolishness: and the end of his talk [is] mischievous madness.<br><a name="14">14</a>  A fool also is full of words: a man cannot tell what shall be; and what shall be after him, who can tell him?<br><a name="15">15</a>  The labour of the foolish wearieth every one of them, because he knoweth not how to go to the city.<br><a name="16">16</a>. Woe to thee, O land, when thy king [is] a child, and thy princes eat in the morning!<br><a name="17">17</a>  Blessed [art] thou, O land, when thy king [is] the son of nobles, and thy princes eat in due season, for strength, and not for drunkenness!<br><a name="18">18</a>  By much slothfulness the building decayeth; and through idleness of the hands the house droppeth through.<br><a name="19">19</a>  A feast is made for laughter, and wine maketh merry: but money answereth all [things].<br><a name="20">20</a>  Curse not the king, no not in thy thought; and curse not the rich in thy bedchamber: for a bird of the air shall carry the voice, and that which hath wings shall tell the matter.<br><br>Go to <a href="ecc11.htm#1">Ecclesiastes 11</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
