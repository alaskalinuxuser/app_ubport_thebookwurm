<b><i>10:1. And when he had called unto [him] his twelve disciples, he gave them power <br>
[against] unclean spirits, to cast them out, <br>
and to heal all manner of sickness and all manner of disease.<br>
10:2  Now the names of the twelve apostles are these; <br>
The first, Simon, who is called Peter, and Andrew his brother; <br>
James [the son] of Zebedee, and John his brother;<br>
10:3  Philip, and Bartholomew; Thomas, and Matthew the publican; <br>
James [the son] of Alphaeus, and Lebbaeus, whose surname was Thaddaeus;<br>
10:4  Simon the Canaanite, </b></i>{ie,. the zealot, <a href="luk6.htm#15">Luke 6:15</a>; <a href="act1.htm#13">Acts 1:13</a>}<b><i><br>
and Judas Iscariot, who also betrayed him.</i></b> {cp. <a href="joh6.htm#70">Joh 6:70,71</a>}</dt><dl>
<dt>disciples - GK=mathetes, a learner, a student, a trainee.
<dt>apostles - GK=apostolos, a person sent forth with orders, a messenger.
<dd>The disciples, who had prayed that laborers would be sent into the Lord's harvest (<a href="mat9.htm#38">9:38</a>), are themselves sent out, as the King's representatives.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The twelve men, who Jesus sent forth, were from different walks of life (fishermen, business men, a tax collector, a political activist...), with different abilities and personalities (the Sons of Thunder, impetuous Peter, double minded Thomas, tender Lebbaeus (lit., 'a man of heart,' who was also called Judas). There were rugged outdoorsmen, and men like Matthew and Judas Iscariot, who were 'men of the cities' (the literal meaning of 'Iscariot' HB=Ish-Kerioth').
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What did they have in common? They were followers of Jesus... His disciples... He sent these twelve men out, two by two (<a href="mar6.htm#7">Mark 6:7</a>), on a ministry practicum assignment... to practice and proclaim what they had learned of Him.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which of these men would you want to have been paired with? How did they do? Apparently, they all, including Judas Iscariot, brought back good reports of their experiences (<a href="mar6.htm#30">Mar 6:30</a>; <a href="luk9.htm#10">Luk 9:10</a>). I wonder which of them was considered 'most likely to succeed,' by the other class members. Sometimes things are not what they seem to be. Only the Lord knows the hearts.
<dt>when he had called them...- Those whom the Lord calls to serve must first be...<dd>- - prepared (eg., <a href="2tim3.htm#16">2Tim 3:16,17</a>), and... <dd>- - commissioned for His service. (eg., <a href="rom10.htm#14">Rom 10:14,15</a>)
<dt>he gave them power {GK=exousia, authority}...- <dd><ul><li>Jesus, whose credentials identified Him as the Messiah of OT prophecy (cp. <a href="mat9.htm#35">9:35</a>),<br>now gave His representatives authority to display those credentials on His behalf.
<li>His two miracles, which preceeded their sending forth, illustrate the need for power.<ul>
<li>To open spiritually blind eyes to see Him. <a href="2cor4.htm#3">2Cor 4:3,4</a>
<li>To loose spiritually bound tongues to speak for Him. <a href="jer1.htm#6">Jer 1:6-9</a>; <a href="eph6.htm#19">Eph 6:19</a></ul>
We also need His power if we are to bear witness for Him. <a href="mat28.htm#18">Mat 28:18-20</a>; <a href="act1.htm#8">Acts 1:8</a></ul></dl>

<dt>whosoever shall not receive you, nor hear your words...- 
<dd>The disciple is not representing himself but His Master. The words rejected are His words. 
(<a href="mat10.htm#40" target="lwr_lt">Mat 10:40</a>; also see Peter's message, <a href="act3.htm#22">Act 3:22-26</a>, which quotes <a href="deu18.htm#15">Deu 18:15-19</a>)
<dt>...shake off the dust of your feet (cp. <a href="luk10.htm#10">Luk 10:10-12</a>) -

<dd>The issue here is not salvation (which is a free gift), but compensation for services rendered.<br>The Lord takes note of how men treat His servants. He will settle accounts in due time. cp. <a href="heb6.htm#10">Heb 6:10</a>
<dt>At the beginning of this chapter, the Lord called, prepared, commissioned and sent out His twelve disciples, on a short practicum as His respresentatives. His teaching (from v.16-42) looked far beyond their brief ministry, to the proclamation of the Gospel of Christ throughout the Church Age, and to the proclamation of the Gospel of the Kingdom by the Jewish Remnant, just prior to the return of the the King. The harvest is plenteous... the labourers are few... the work is not easy... Yet, He empowers... sustains... sees... and rewards His servants, as they carry His Word to the ends of the earth.<dd>But how will the hearers receive the message from the King? This question is answered in the following chapters.
