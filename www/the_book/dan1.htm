Daniel   1<br>1. In the third year of the reign of Jehoiakim king of Judah came Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon unto Jerusalem, and besieged it.<br><a name="2">2</a>  And the Lord gave Jehoiakim king of Judah into his hand, with part of the vessels of the house of God: which he carried into the land of Shinar to the house of his god; and he brought the vessels into the treasure house of his god.<br><a name="3">3</a>  And the king spake unto Ashpenaz the master of his eunuchs, that he should bring [certain] of the children of Israel, and of the king's seed, and of the princes;<br><a name="4">4</a>  Children in whom [was] no blemish, but well favoured, and skilful in all wisdom, and cunning in knowledge, and understanding science, and such as [had] ability in them to stand in the king's palace, and whom they might teach the learning and the tongue of the Chaldeans.<br><a name="5">5</a>  And the king appointed them a daily provision of the king's meat, and of the wine which he drank: so nourishing them three years, that at the end thereof they might stand before the king.<br><a name="6">6</a>  Now among these were of the children of Judah, Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah:<br><a name="7">7</a>  Unto whom the prince of the eunuchs gave names: for he gave unto Daniel [the name] of Belteshazzar; and to Hananiah, of Shadrach; and to Mishael, of Meshach; and to Azariah, of Abednego.<br><a name="8">8</a>. But Daniel purposed in his heart that he would not defile himself with the portion of the king's meat, nor with the wine which he drank: therefore he requested of the prince of the eunuchs that he might not defile himself.<br><a name="9">9</a>  Now God had brought Daniel into favour and tender love with the prince of the eunuchs.<br><a name="10">10</a>  And the prince of the eunuchs said unto Daniel, I fear my lord the king, who hath appointed your meat and your drink: for why should he see your faces worse liking than the children which [are] of your sort? then shall ye make [me] endanger my head to the king.<br><a name="11">11</a>  Then said Daniel to Melzar, whom the prince of the eunuchs had set over Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah,<br><a name="12">12</a>  Prove thy servants, I beseech thee, ten days; and let them give us pulse to eat, and water to drink.<br><a name="13">13</a>  Then let our countenances be looked upon before thee, and the countenance of the children that eat of the portion of the king's meat: and as thou seest, deal with thy servants.<br><a name="14">14</a>  So he consented to them in this matter, and proved them ten days.<br><a name="15">15</a>  And at the end of ten days their countenances appeared fairer and fatter in flesh than all the children which did eat the portion of the king's meat.<br><a name="16">16</a>  Thus Melzar took away the portion of their meat, and the wine that they should drink; and gave them pulse.<br><a name="17">17</a>. As for these four children, God gave them knowledge and skill in all learning and wisdom: and Daniel had understanding in all visions and dreams.<br><a name="18">18</a>  Now at the end of the days that the king had said he should bring them in, then the prince of the eunuchs brought them in before Nebuchadnezzar.<br><a name="19">19</a>  And the king communed with them; and among them all was found none like Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah: therefore stood they before the king.<br><a name="20">20</a>  And in all matters of wisdom [and] understanding, that the king enquired of them, he found them ten times better than all the magicians [and] astrologers that [were] in all his realm.<br><a name="21">21</a>  And Daniel continued [even] unto the first year of king Cyrus.<br><br>Go to <a href="dan2.htm#1">Daniel 2</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
