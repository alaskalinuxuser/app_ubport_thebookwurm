<dl><dt>
<b><i>14:1 And I looked, and, lo,</i></b>
<dd>John sees a new vision. The reader is invited to &quot;see for yourself&quot;:<dt>
<b><i>a Lamb stood on the mount Sion,<br>
and with him an hundred forty [and] four thousand,<br>
having</i></b> {lit., his name and} <b><i>his Father's name written in their foreheads.</i></b></dt><dl>
<dt>Ch. 13 described the unholy trinity prevailing in war against the saints.
<dd>What will become of those who belong to Christ?
<dt>In <a href="rev14.htm#1" target="lwr_lt">v.1-5</a>, we are given a glimpse into the future, to an event on earth shortly after the reign of the beast. 
<dd>When the Lord Jesus Christ establishes His Kingdom in Jerusalem (Mt. Zion), the 144,000 will stand with Him.<br>These, who were sealed (cp. <a href="rev7.htm#3">7:3,4</a>) at the opening of the tribulation, still stand on earth, at its conclusion.<br>The Lamb, who is also the Great Shepherd of the Sheep, has lost not one. cp. <a href="2tim2.htm#19">2Tim 2:19</a>; <a href="jude1.htm#24">Jude 1:24</a>
<dt>Contrast &quot;the seal of the living God&quot; (<a href="rev7.htm#2">7:2</a>) with &quot;His Name &amp; His Father's Name&quot; in their foreheads. 
<dd>It may be that, at the time of their sealing, these Jewish men have a sincere faith in God, but have not quite recognized Christ as their Messiah. They like their brethren, turn to Him in their affliction (ie., during the Tribulation, the Time of Jacob's Trouble).</dl><dt>
<b><i>14:2 And I heard a voice from heaven, as the voice of many waters,<br>
and as the voice of a great thunder:</i></b>
<dd>The voices of several choirs mingle here:<dd>-- First, the redeemed in heaven, in harmony with the voice of the Lord. cp. <a href="rev1.htm#15">1:15</a>; <a href="rev19.htm#6">19:6,11,14</a><dt>
<b><i>and I heard the voice of harpers harping with their harps:</i></b>
<dd>-- Second, the martyrs, from the tribulation, who are in heaven. <a href="rev15.htm#2">15:2</a><dt>
<b><i>14:3 And they sung as it were a new song before the throne,<br>
and before the four beasts, and the elders:<br>
and no man could learn that song but the hundred [and] forty [and] four thousand,<br>
which were redeemed from the earth.</i></b></dt><dl>
<dt>they- (refers back to <a href="rev14.htm#1" target="lwr_lt">v.1</a>)<dd>-- The third choir is the 144,000.
<dt>before the throne...- before- GK= enopion, in the sight of, in the presence of.
<dd>Based on this word, some believe the 144,000 must be in heaven as they sing. The word does not require it. John says he saw them standing with the Lord, on Mount Zion, which is on the earth.
<dt>a new song- the GK without the definite article emphasizes the newness of the song. 
<dd>cp. <a href="rev5.htm#9">Rev 5:9</a>
<dt>no one could learn- The experience of the 144,000 is unique.</dl><dt>
<b><i>14:4 These are they which were not defiled with women; for they are virgins.</i></b></dt><dl>
<dt>these are they- the repetition of this phrase (twice in this verse)
<dd>sets them apart from others in honor &amp; character.
<dt>not defiled... virgins- Shows their moral &amp; spiritual purity.
<dd>During a time of moral corruption &amp; spiritual fornication (cf. <a href="rev9.htm#21">9:21</a>; <a href="rev17.htm#2">17:2</a>; <a href="rev19.htm#2">19:2</a>),
<br>they were not seduced by &quot;another Jesus... another spirit... another gospel.&quot; <a href="2cor11.htm#2">2Cor 11:2-4</a>
<dt>virgins- implies they were unmarried, perhaps due to the distress of the time, 
<dd>and also to dedicate themselves fully to the Lord's service.<br>cp. <a href="1cor7.htm#25">1Cor 7:25-28,32-33</a>; <a href="jer16.htm#1">Jer 16:1-4</a>; <a href="mat19.htm#12">Mat 19:12</a>; <a href="mat24.htm#19"> 24:19</a></dl><dt>
<b><i>These are they which follow the Lamb whithersoever he goeth.</i></b>
<dd>They had not shrunk back from suffering for Christ's sake.
<br>Now, they experience the refreshing of His Presence. (cp. <a href="rev7.htm#17">7:17</a>)<dt>
<b><i>These were redeemed from among men,<br>
[being] the firstfruits unto God and to the Lamb.</i></b></dt><dl>
<dt>firstfruits- the beginnings of a greater harvest. 
<dd>Christ is called &quot;the firstfruits of them that slept&quot; being the first of many to rise from the dead. So, during the tribulation (after the close of the Church Age), the 144,000 are the first Jewish people to repent and receive their Messiah. But in the end, &quot;all Israel shall be saved.&quot;<br><a href="1cor15.htm#20">1Cor 15:20,23</a>; <a href="rom11.htm#15">Rom 11:15-16,25-26</a>; <a href="zech12.htm#9">Zech 12:9,10</a>; <a href="zech13.htm#1">13:1</a></dl><dt>
<b><i>14:5 And in their mouth was found no guile:</i></b></dt><dl>
<dt>guile- GK= 'dolos', bait, snare, deceit. (Some MSS have &quot;lie.&quot;)
<dt>no guile-<ul>
<li>Apparently, their sincerity made them receptive to the Truth.<br>Compare the experience of Nathanael, &quot;an Israelite indeed, in whom is no guile&quot; (cp. <a href="joh1.htm#45">Joh 1:45-51</a>).<ul>
<li>Hearing that Jesus is Israel's Messiah, he had sincere doubts (v.45,46).
<dd>[Likewise, the 144,000 may hear, but question the claims of Christ, prior to the Rapture of the true church.]</dd>
<li>Personally confronted by Jesus, he believed (v.47-49).
<dd>[Following the Rapture, as prophetic events unfold, the 144,000 will recognize and receive Jesus as their Messiah.]</dd>
<li>Thereafter, he came to see that, upon Jesus, the covenant promises, of God toward Israel, would be fulfilled (v.50-51).
<dd>Note Nathanael's declaration: &quot;Thou art the Son of God; Thou art the King of Israel&quot; (v.49).<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 144,000 will share this absolute certainty concerning the identity of Jesus. While the world worships the false christ, the 144,000 will proclaim the Gospel of Christ's Kingdom (<a href="mat24.htm#14">Mat 24:14</a>). The Gospel of the Kingdom was proclaimed by Christ, during His earthly ministry. But following the King's rejection, crucifixion and resurrection, the Gospel of Grace was proclaimed to all people (eg., <a href="rom1.htm#16">Rom 1:16</a>; <a href="rom10.htm#9">10:9-10</a>). The 144,000, who are themselves among the &quot;redeemed&quot; (<a href="rev14.htm#3" target="lwr_lt">v.3,4</a>), will declare the necessity of faith in Christ for redemption from sin (<a href="rom3.htm#23">Rom 3:23-26</a>), and also the imminence of His return as Judge and King.</ul>
<li>The character of their witness will be in marked contrast to the deceptive signs &amp; lying wonders of the beasts. cp. <a href="2cor4.htm#1">2Cor 4:1-4</a></ul></dl><dt>
<b><i>for they are without fault before the throne of God.</i></b>
<dd>Redeemed by Christ, they are like Him, not only in speech, but also in heart.
<dd><a href="1pet2.htm#21">1Pet 2:21-25</a>; <a href="col1.htm#21">Col 1:21,22</a>
<dt>&nbsp;
<br>From this point to the end of ch. 14, we see 7 persons:
<dd>3 angels (<a href="rev14.htm#6" target="lwr_lt">v.6-13</a>), Christ (<a href="rev14.htm#14" target="lwr_lt">v.14,16</a>), 3 angels (<a href="rev14.htm#15" target="lwr_lt">v.15,17-20</a>).
<br>This section describes events immediately preceding and including the final judgment of world.<dt>
<b><i>14:6 And I saw another angel fly in the midst of heaven</i></b> {lit., in mid-heaven},
<dd>A previous angel, so described, announced the 3 woes. (<a href="rev8.htm#13">8:13</a>)<dt>
<b><i>having the everlasting gospel</i></b> {lit., having everlasting gospel} <b><i>to preach</i></b>
<dd>The lack of an article emphasizes the everlasting character of the gospel.<br>&quot;Gospel&quot; means &quot;good tidings.&quot;<dt>
<b><i>unto them that dwell on the earth, <br>
and to every nation, and kindred, and tongue, and people,</i></b>
<dd>The tribulation has taken its toll. Human voices have been silenced from proclaiming the gospel. God sends out a final call by an indestructible messenger. (McGee)<dt>
<b><i>14:7 Saying with a loud voice, Fear God, and give glory to him; <br>
for the hour of his judgment is come:<br>
and worship him that made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and the fountains of waters.</i></b></dt><dl>
<dt>loud voice- The message is urgent.
<dt>The first angel's message -<ul>
<li>Announces the imminency of the hour of judgment. The long foretold time has come.
<li>Urges men to fear &amp; worship the true God, rather than the beast.</ul>
<dt>The essence of the message is that the God, who is the Creator of all, is about to exercise judgment.<ul><li>His authority over creation has been shown by prior judgments, which affected the 4 areas of creation mentioned.<dd>In contrast, what basis is there for worship of the beast? (None, but lies.)</dd>
<li>The Judge has rendered His 'judgment' {GK= krisis, sentence, decision, verdict}, which will be executed without further delay.</ul>
<dt>The Hour of Judgment is a terrible event for the unbelieving world.<dd>Yet, it is &quot;good news&quot; to suffering saints whose salvation rests on God's righteous judgment of sin.<br><a href="luk21.htm#25">Luk 21:25-28</a>; <a href="psa96.htm#11">Psa 96:11-13</a>; <a href="isa35.htm#4">Isa 35:4-10</a></dl>
<dt><b><i>14:8 And there followed another angel, saying, </i></b> {angel #2 in this chapter}<br>
<b><i>Babylon is fallen, is fallen, that great city,<br>
because she made all nations drink of the wine of the wrath of her fornication.</i></b></dt><dl>
<dt>The second angel announces judgment upon the world system.
<dt>Babylon- The ancient city which was the beginning of idolatry &amp; self-deification (<a href="rev2an.htm#20">note at 2:20</a>), <dd>is symbollic of the godless political &amp; religious systems which grew out of her. The name Babylon (meaning &quot;confusion&quot;) describes a system built by, for, and upon man who rejects the only true foundation (cp. <a href="rom1.htm#18">Rom 1:18-23</a>; <a href="col1.htm#16">Col 1:16,17</a>).
<dt>is fallen- Her destruction is stated as accomplished fact. <dd>This is prophetic of what MUST occur, and anticipates the outpouring of the seventh Bowl of Wrath (ch. 16).
<dt>is fallen- The repetition is emphatic of the utter ruin of the city &amp; the system.
<dd>The city of Babylon has not yet suffered that total destruction prophesied.
<dd>cp. <a href="isa13.htm#19">Isa 13:19,20</a>; <a href="isa21.htm#9">21:9</a>
<dd>At about the time of the city's destruction, religious (ch. 17) and political (ch. 18) &quot;Babylon&quot; will also be destroyed.
<dt>the wrath (of God)- because of the moral &amp; spiritual fornication <dd>promoted by Babylon (in all its forms). cp. <a href="psa75.htm#7">Psa 75:7,8</a>
<dt>This announcement also appears to be meant as encouragement to the saints.</dl><dt>
<b><i>14:9 And the third angel followed them,</i></b>
<dd>The 3 angels of vs.6-12 follow one another quickly without delay.<dt>
<b><i>saying with a loud voice,<br>
If any man</i></b> {lit., any one} <b><i>worship the beast and his image,<br>
and receive [his] mark in his forehead, or in his hand,</i></b><dt>
<b><i>14:10 The same</i></b> {lit., he himself} <b><i>shall drink of the wine of the wrath of God,<br>
which is poured out without mixture into the cup of his indignation;</i></b></dt><dl>
<dt>he himself- The wrath of God is not only for nations, but for individuals.
<dd>The third angel announces judgment upon individuals.
<dt>if any man receive- Who will refuse?<dd>The mark &amp; worship of the beast will seem a small price for access to life's necessities, including food &amp; drink (<a href="rev13.htm#15">13:15-17</a>).
<br>But God, in wrath, remembers mercy and warns of the ultimate price:
<dt>wrath...without mixture...- without dilution. There is not a drop of mercy in it. [JBS]
<dd>Undiluted Wrath (without mixture with water) is poured out upon men who rejected the freely available fountain of living waters (<a href="rev14.htm#7" target="lwr_lt">v.7</a>) for the intoxication of polluted religious streams which were palatable to the flesh (<a href="rev14.htm#8" target="lwr_lt">v.8</a>). God gives them the full measure of the corruption which they desired. <a href="psa75.htm#7">Psa 75:7,8</a>
<dt>Two GK words are used here to express God's anger:
<dd>wrath- GK= thumos, hot anger, rising to a peak of passion.
<br>indignation- GK= orge, wrath. This is the strongest form of anger, which does not heat and cool, but is set on active vengeance.</dl><dt>
<b><i>and he shall be tormented with fire and brimstone</i></b></dt><dl>
<dt>Some would dilute this wrath by making these words figurative.
<dd>But that which fell upon Sodom &amp; Gomorah was literal enough. [McGee]
<br>If the language is symbollic, it is no doubt an understatement -- as the aroma of gasoline is only vaguely suggestive of danger, until the spark ignites it.</dl><dt>
<b><i>in the presence of the holy angels, and in the presence of the Lamb:</i></b>
<dd>in the presence- GK= enopion, in the sight of, before. This suggests that:<ul>
<li>Christ and the angels witness the sentence executed upon those who denied Christ to  align with the antichrist. (But the saints are spared this sight. [McGee] ) <a href="luk12.htm#8">Luk 12:8,9</a>
<li>Those in torment will forever have in view what might have been. cp. <a href="luk16.htm#23">Luk 16:23,24</a></ul><dt>
<b><i>14:11 And the smoke of their torment ascendeth up for ever and ever:</i></b></dt><dl>
<dt>forever and ever- Is used elsewhere of the ceaseless existence of God (eg., <a href="rev15.htm#7">Rev 15:7</a>).
<dd>Here it describes torment that is equally without end. Since there is no torment without conscious existence, their conscious existence must also be without end.</dl><dt>
<b><i>and they have no rest day nor night,</i></b>
<dd>no rest- implies unbroken continuance. The tormented receive no breaks.<dt>
<b><i>who worship the beast and his image,<br>
and whosoever receiveth the mark of his name.</i></b></dt><dl>
<dt>Those who worship the beast will join him (and his comrades) in the lake of fire:
<dd> <a href="rev20.htm#10">Rev 20:10</a>; <a href="mat25.htm#41">Mat 25:41</a>
<dt>Some, who are unable to reconcile God's love with His wrath,<dd>would remove passages like this from the Book.<br>But to do so, is to reserve a place for oneself in that lake. cp. <a href="rev22.htm#19">Rev 22:19</a>; <a href="rev20.htm#15">20:15</a></dl><dt>
<b><i>14:12 Here is the patience</i></b> {ie., endurance} <b><i>of the saints:</i></b>
<dd>Even the warning of wrath delivered by the third angel (<a href="rev14.htm#9" target="lwr_lt">v.9-11</a>) is meant to encourage the suffering saints. <ul><li>Justice will be served.<li>The Judge of all the earth will do right.<li>It is worth waiting for Him.  <a href="mat24.htm#12">Mat 24:12,13</a>; <a href="rev13.htm#10">Rev 13:10</a></ul><dt>
<b><i>here [are] they that keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus.</i></b>
<dd>Those, who endure, obey, with careful attention to and conviction in, a higher Authority than the beast. They trust the One whose Name is Salvation. (The name 'Jesus' means 'Jehovah Saves' or 'Jehovah is Salvation.')<dt>
<b><i>14:13 And I heard a voice from heaven saying unto me, Write,</i></b>
<dd>a voice from heaven- apparently the Spirit of God, as later in the verse.
<br>write- This command implies that the message is important, not to be forgotten, nor mistated.<dt>
<b><i>Blessed [are] the dead which die in the Lord from henceforth:<br>
Yea, saith the Spirit, that they may rest from their labours;<br>
and their works do follow them.</i></b></dt><dl>
<dt>blessed- Contrast the cursedness of those who die with the mark of the beast (<a href="rev14.htm#10" target="lwr_lt">v.10,11</a>).
<dd>This verse is often misused at funerals. It applies to a specific time:
<dt>from henceforth- ie., from now on. The time reference is late in the Tribulation period.
<dd>All who die in the Lord are blessed, but especially during the Great Tribulation, when death will provide a welcome escape for saints from the beast's war against them. At that time, believers will have no ambiguity about whether it is better to go or to stay. cp. <a href="php1.htm#23">Php 1:23-26</a>
<dt>that they may rest- cf. &quot;no rest&quot; in <a href="rev14.htm#11" target="lwr_lt">v.11</a>.
<dt>from their labors- GK= kopos, toils to weariness, laborious toil, trouble.
<dt>their works follow with them- The things they have done, <dd>their faithful patient witness, will not be forgotten by the Lord. <a href="mat10.htm#39">Mat 10:39-42</a></dl><dt>
<b><i>14:14 And I looked, and behold a white cloud,<br>
and upon the cloud [one] sat like unto the Son of man,<br>
having on his head a golden crown, and in his hand a sharp sickle.</i></b></dt><dl>
<dt>behold- Look for yourself. Consider this sight with the eyes of tribulation saints:<blockquote>
<dt>&quot;Look ye saints, the sight is glorious:
<dd>See the man of sorrows now;
<dt>From the fight returned victorious;
<dd>Every knee to Him shall bow:
<dt>Crown Him!  Crown Him!
<dd>Crowns become the Victor's brow.&quot;  [Thomas Kelly]</blockquote>
<dt>white cloud- As Christ ascended, so shall He return. cp. <a href="act1.htm#9">Acts 1:9-11</a>; <a href="mat24.htm#30">Mat 24:30</a>
<dt>son of man- Refers to Christ with dual significance:
<dd>His humanity &amp; His right to judge. <a href="joh5.htm#22">Joh 5:22,27</a>
<dt>on his head a golden crown- His time to reign has come.
<dd>(This implies the uncrowning of the Dragon's heads &amp; horns. cp. ch. 12,13.)
<dt>in his hand a sharp sickle-<dd>-- &quot;Sharp&quot; denotes severity of judgment.
<dd>-- &quot;Sickle&quot; implies the cutting off of something. 
<br>Neither of these terms can be applied to the true Church, which remains &quot;in the vine,&quot; and which is called into his presence by His voice.<br>His sharp sword will penetrate the apostate church. <a href="rev2.htm#12">Rev 2:12</a><br>His sickle will reap the unbelieving nations at Armageddon. <a href="rev19.htm#15">Rev 19:15</a>; <a href="joel3.htm#12">Joel 3:12-15</a></dl><dt>
<b><i>14:15 And another angel came out of the temple,</i></b></dt><dl>
<dt>another angel- ie., like the first three in this chapter.
<dt>temple- GK= naos, holy place. This is the temple in heaven (cp. <a href="rev14.htm#17" target="lwr_lt">v.17</a>). 
<dd>God's judgment proceeds out of His holiness.
<dd>At this time, the temple on earth will contain the abomination of desolation.</dl><dt>
<b><i>crying with a loud voice to him that sat on the cloud,<br>
Thrust in thy sickle, and reap:<br>
for the time is come for thee to reap; for the harvest of the earth is ripe.</i></b></dt><dl>
<dt>thrust in- GK= pempo, to send forth.
<dt>ripe- GK= xeraino, dried up, withered, overripe. 
<dd>cp. this word in: <a href="mat21.htm#19">Mat 21:19,20</a>; <a href="luk8.htm#6">Luk 8:6</a>; <a href="joh15.htm#6">Joh 15:6</a>; cp. <a href="isa40.htm#23">Isa 40:23,24</a>
<dt>the harvest- is of the tares to judgment. <a href="jer51.htm#33">Jer 51:33</a>; <a href="mat13.htm#30">Mat 13:30,38-43</a></dl><dt>
<b><i>14:16 And he that sat on the cloud thrust in his sickle on the earth;<br>
and the earth was reaped.</i></b></dt><dl>
<dt>thrust in- GK= eballo, to throw in, to cast in.
<dt>the earth was reaped- The GK verb is in a passive tense.<dd>This reaping is accomplished, not directly by Christ, but at His command, by the angel's whom He &quot;sends forth.&quot; cp. <a href="mat13.htm#40">Mat 13:40-42,49-50</a> (In Mat 13:41, &quot;send forth&quot; is GK= apostello. However, the sense is very similar to the use of &quot;pempo&quot; in v.15 above. In Mat 13:42, &quot;cast&quot; is GK= eballo. Compare the use of this word in <a href="joh15.htm#6">Joh 15:6</a>; <a href="rev8.htm#5">Rev 8:5</a>; <a href="rev14.htm#19">14:19</a>; <a href="rev18.htm#21">18:21</a>; <a href="rev20.htm#14">20:14,15</a>. In the NT, &quot;eballo&quot; is never used in a way that could be associated with the gathering of the redeemed.)</dl><dt>
<b><i>14:17 And another angel came out of the temple which is in heaven,<br>
he also having a sharp sickle.</i></b></dt><dl>
<dt>another angel- the fifth in this chapter.
<dt>out of the temple- Again, God's holiness requires judgment.
<dd>His judgment is not vindictive, but rather vindicative of His holiness. [JBS]</dl><dt>
<b><i>14:18 And another angel came out from the altar, which had power over fire;</i></b></dt><dl>
<dt>another angel- the sixth in this chapter.
<dt>power over fire- cp. <a href="rev16.htm#8">16:8</a>
<dt>from the altar- the altar of incense (which speaks of prayer). (cp. <a href="rev6.htm#9">6:9,10</a>; <a href="rev8.htm#3">8:3,5</a>)
<dd>The judgment comes in answer to the prayers of the saints.</dl><dt>
<b><i>and cried with a loud cry to him that had the sharp sickle, saying,<br>
Thrust in thy sharp sickle, and gather the clusters of the vine of the earth;<br>
for her grapes are fully ripe.</i></b></dt><dl>
<dt>thrust in- GK= pempo, send forth. (as in <a href="rev14.htm#15" target="lwr_lt">v.15</a>)
<dt>gather- Some have attempted to separate the gathering of the harvest (v.15) 
<dd>from the gathering of the vine (v.18), in order to fit the rapture of the saints into this chapter.<br>However, there is no basis for this.<ul><li>The harvest and the winepress are both descriptive of the same event (the battle of Armageddon). Cp. <a href="joel3.htm#12">Joel 3:12-16</a><li>The last three angels in this chapter impliment the judgment which the first three angels announced. The Son of Man, the central figure in the chapter, presides over it all, for He is the righteous Judge.</ul> 
<dt>vine of the earth- This unholy vine is the planting of Satan, <dd>consisting of all nations who would destroy God's vine and its Planter. [JBS]  <dd>Compare/Contrast with: <a href="deu32.htm#31">Deut 32:31-43</a><dd>
<dd>The &quot;vine of the earth&quot; is to be distinguished from:<ul>
<li>Israel, God's planting.<dd>Because Israel wandered after other gods and because they rejected Christ, their vineyard has been trampled (<a href="isa5.htm#1">Isa 5:1-7</a>; <a href="mat21.htm#33">Mat 21:33-44</a>).<br>But this vineyard will be restored, through the work of Christ, when they turn to Him in faith (<a href="isa60.htm#21">Isa 60:21</a>; <a href="isa61.htm#1">61:1-4</a>).
<li>Christ, the true vine, through whom those, who are in Him, live and bear fruit. <a href="joh15.htm#1">Joh 15:1-5</a></ul>
<dt>fully ripe- GK= akmazo (the root word is &quot;akme&quot;), at the peak, prime (ie., ready for judgment.)</dl><dt>
<b><i>14:19 And the angel thrust in</i></b> {GK= eballo, cast in} <b><i>his sickle into the earth,<br>
and gathered the vine of the earth,<br>
and cast [it] into the great winepress of the wrath of God.</i></b></dt><dl>
<dt>The nations are gathered to the place of judgment. <dd>When God planted Israel in their land, He &quot;also made a winepress therein&quot; (<a href="isa5.htm#2">Isa 5:2</a>). God's wrath upon the godless world will be exercized finally in this land, including the environs of Armageddon &amp; Jerusalem. <a href="joel3.htm#9">Joel 3:9-16</a></dl><dt>
<b><i>14:20 And the winepress was trodden without the city,</i></b> {ie., outside of Jerusalem}
<dd>cp. <a href="zech14.htm#1">Zech 14:1-4</a>; <a href="isa63.htm#1">Isa 63:1-6</a>; <a href="rev19.htm#15">Rev 19:15</a><dt>

<dt>furlong- a measure of about 600 feet.
<dd>The total area involved is about 180 miles long (the N-S dimension of Israel).
<br>Based on <a href="psa29.htm#1">Psa 29</a>, JBSmith suggests that the valley formed by the earthquake at Christ's return may extend, from Lebanon and Sirion {ie., Mt. Hermon} in the north, to the wilderness of Kadesh in the south. This valley may collect &amp; contain the drainage of blood from the battle of Armageddon.

<dt>This chapter has brought us up to the coming of the Lord in judgment
<dd>&quot;immediately after the tribulation of those days&quot; (<a href="mat24.htm#29">Mat 24:29,30</a>).
<br>This judgment is not a pretty sight. But it shows us that sin is an awful thing, and that God will deal with it according to His righteousness.
<dt>The Great Tribulation is an expression of God's wrath upon sinful men who have rejected the Savior.
<dd>This period is not meant to purify the Church, or to make her worthy for Christ's return. While God does use the minor tribulations (ie., little troubles) of our lives to mature us, only the blood of Christ can cleanse and make us fit for His presence.
<dt>Are you in Christ?<ul><li>If so, He will keep you from the wrath to come. <a href="rom5.htm#9">Rom 5:9</a>; <a href="1the1.htm#10">1Thes 1:10</a>; <a href="1the5.htm#9">5:9</a>; <a href="rev3.htm#10">Rev 3:10</a>
<li>If not, do not delay, for the invitation is urgent (<a href="2cor5.htm#20">2Cor 5:20</a> - <a href="2cor6.htm#1">6:1,2</a>).</ul>
