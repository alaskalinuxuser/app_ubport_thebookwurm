Job  28<br>1. Surely there is a vein for the silver, and a place for gold [where] they fine [it].<br><a name="2">2</a>  Iron is taken out of the earth, and brass [is] molten [out of] the stone.<br><a name="3">3</a>  He setteth an end to darkness, and searcheth out all perfection: the stones of darkness, and the shadow of death.<br><a name="4">4</a>  The flood breaketh out from the inhabitant; [even the waters] forgotten of the foot: they are dried up, they are gone away from men.<br><a name="5">5</a>  [As for] the earth, out of it cometh bread: and under it is turned up as it were fire.<br><a name="6">6</a>  The stones of it [are] the place of sapphires: and it hath dust of gold.<br><a name="7">7</a>  [There is] a path which no fowl knoweth, and which the vulture's eye hath not seen:<br><a name="8">8</a>  The lion's whelps have not trodden it, nor the fierce lion passed by it.<br><a name="9">9</a>  He putteth forth his hand upon the rock; he overturneth the mountains by the roots.<br><a name="10">10</a>  He cutteth out rivers among the rocks; and his eye seeth every precious thing.<br><a name="11">11</a>  He bindeth the floods from overflowing; and [the thing that is] hid bringeth he forth to light.<br><a name="12">12</a>  But where shall wisdom be found? and where [is] the place of understanding?<br><a name="13">13</a>  Man knoweth not the price thereof; neither is it found in the land of the living.<br><a name="14">14</a>. The depth saith, It [is] not in me: and the sea saith, [It is] not with me.<br><a name="15">15</a>  It cannot be gotten for gold, neither shall silver be weighed [for] the price thereof.<br><a name="16">16</a>  It cannot be valued with the gold of Ophir, with the precious onyx, or the sapphire.<br><a name="17">17</a>  The gold and the crystal cannot equal it: and the exchange of it [shall not be for] jewels of fine gold.<br><a name="18">18</a>  No mention shall be made of coral, or of pearls: for the price of wisdom [is] above rubies.<br><a name="19">19</a>  The topaz of Ethiopia shall not equal it, neither shall it be valued with pure gold.<br><a name="20">20</a>. Whence then cometh wisdom? and where [is] the place of understanding?<br><a name="21">21</a>  Seeing it is hid from the eyes of all living, and kept close from the fowls of the air.<br><a name="22">22</a>  Destruction and death say, We have heard the fame thereof with our ears.<br><a name="23">23</a>  God understandeth the way thereof, and he knoweth the place thereof.<br><a name="24">24</a>  For he looketh to the ends of the earth, [and] seeth under the whole heaven;<br><a name="25">25</a>  To make the weight for the winds; and he weigheth the waters by measure.<br><a name="26">26</a>  When he made a decree for the rain, and a way for the lightning of the thunder:<br><a name="27">27</a>  Then did he see it, and declare it; he prepared it, yea, and searched it out.<br><a name="28">28</a>  And unto man he said, Behold, the fear of the Lord, that [is] wisdom; and to depart from evil [is] understanding.<br><br>Go to <a href="job29.htm#1">Job 29</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
