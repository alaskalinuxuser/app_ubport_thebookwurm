1Corinthians   6<br> 1. Dare any of you, having a matter against another, go to law before the unjust, and not before the saints?<br><a name="2">2</a>  Do ye not know that the saints shall judge the world? and if the world shall be judged by you, are ye unworthy to judge the smallest matters?<br><a name="3">3</a>  Know ye not that we shall judge angels? how much more things that pertain to this life?<br><a name="4">4</a>  If then ye have judgments of things pertaining to this life, set them to judge who are least esteemed in the church.<br><a name="5">5</a>  I speak to your shame. Is it so, that there is not a wise man among you? no, not one that shall be able to judge between his brethren?<br><a name="6">6</a>  But brother goeth to law with brother, and that before the unbelievers.<br><a name="7">7</a>  Now therefore there is utterly a fault among you, because ye go to law one with another. Why do ye not rather take wrong? why do ye not rather [suffer yourselves to] be defrauded?<br><a name="8">8</a>  Nay, ye do wrong, and defraud, and that [your] brethren.<br><a name="9">9</a>. Know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God? Be not deceived: neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with mankind,<br><a name="10">10</a>  Nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners, shall inherit the kingdom of God.<br><a name="11">11</a>  And such were some of you: but ye are washed, but ye are sanctified, but ye are justified in the name of the Lord Jesus, and by the Spirit of our God.<br><a name="12">12</a>. All things are lawful unto me, but all things are not expedient: all things are lawful for me, but I will not be brought under the power of any.<br><a name="13">13</a>  Meats for the belly, and the belly for meats: but God shall destroy both it and them. Now the body [is] not for fornication, but for the Lord; and the Lord for the body.<br><a name="14">14</a>  And God hath both raised up the Lord, and will also raise up us by his own power.<br><a name="15">15</a>  Know ye not that your bodies are the members of Christ? shall I then take the members of Christ, and make [them] the members of an harlot? God forbid.<br><a name="16">16</a>  What? know ye not that he which is joined to an harlot is one body? for two, saith he, shall be one flesh.<br><a name="17">17</a>  But he that is joined unto the Lord is one spirit.<br><a name="18">18</a>  Flee fornication. Every sin that a man doeth is without the body; but he that committeth fornication sinneth against his own body.<br><a name="19">19</a>  What? know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost [which is] in you, which ye have of God, and ye are not your own?<br><a name="20">20</a>  For ye are bought with a price: therefore glorify God in your body, and in your spirit, which are God's.<br><br>Go to <a href="1cor7.htm#1">I Corinthians 7</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
