<b>Volume 4, Lesson 13</b><br>
by C.I. Scofield
<h2>Wilderness Experiences, Part III</h2>
<h3><i>The Conflict with Amalek (Exodus 17:8-16)</i></h3></center>
<p>Amalek was the father of the Amalekites, Israel's most persistent enemy. He was a grandson of Esau (<a href="gen36.htm#12">Genesis 36:12</a>), who was &quot;born after the flesh&quot; (<a href="gal4.htm#22">Galatians 4:22-29</a>). We have the very highest authority (<a href="joh3.htm#6">John 3:6</a>) for the statement that &quot;flesh&quot; can only produce &quot;flesh.&quot; Amalek therefore is a type of the flesh -- what the believer is by nature. Nothing changes &quot;flesh.&quot;</p>
<b><ol type="A">
<li>The conflict in the wilderness</b><ul>
<li><a href="ex17.htm#8">Exodus 17:8</a> -- &quot;Then came Amalek, and fought with Israel in Rephidim&quot;
<li><a href="gal5.htm#17">Galatians 5:17</a> -- &quot;The flesh lusteth against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh... these are contrary&quot;</ul>
<p>It is important to note that Amalek makes his assault just when Israel is in the full tide of blessing. Fed with the bread from heaven (<a href="ex16.htm#14">Exodus 16:14-18</a>; <a href="joh6.htm#31">John 6:31-35</a>), and refreshed by water from the rock (<a href="ex17.htm#5">Exodus 17:5-7</a>; <a href="joh4.htm#14">Joh 4:14</a>; <a href="eph1.htm#13">Ephesians 1:13</a>), it was perhaps a time when Israel let down its guard.</p><b>
<li>The secret of victory</b><ol type="1">
<li>Resistance<ul>
<li><a href="ex17.htm#9">Exodus 17:9,10</a> -- &quot;Choose us out men... fight... so Joshua... fought&quot;</ul>
<li>Victory through the rod of God<ul>
<li><a href="ex17.htm#9">Exodus 17:9-12</a> -- &quot;I will stand... with the rod of God in mine hand... when Moses held up his hand, that Israel prevailed&quot;</ul>
<p>The &quot;rod of God&quot; had first been Moses' shepherd staff, or crook. It was the rod of <a href="psa23.htm#4">Psalm 23:4</a> in its literal sense (<a href="ex4.htm#2">Exodus 4:2</a>). In that sense it was the token of his occupation. Cast upon the ground, it became a serpent (<a href="ex4.htm#3">Exodus 4:3</a>). Taken up by Jehovah's command it became the rod of God, used to do &quot;signs in the sight of the people&quot; (<a href="ex4.htm#30">Exodus 4:30</a>). As such, it became the instrument of divine deliverence (<a href="ex7.htm#17">Exodus 7:17,20</a>; <a href="ex8.htm#5">8:5,16</a>). It was even seen as &quot;The finger of God&quot; (<a href="ex8.htm#19">Exodus 8:19</a>).</p></ol><b>
<li>Victory through the Spirit of God</b><ol type="1">
<li>The Law (works) cannot defeat Amalek<ul>
<li><a href="rom7.htm#7">Romans 7:7-14</a> -- &quot;Is the law sin? ... When the commandment came, sin [the flesh] revived&quot;</ul>
<li>Self-effort cannot defeat Amalek<ul>
<li><a href="rom7.htm#15">Romans 7:15-24</a> -- &quot;What I hate, that do I&quot;</ul>
<li>Victory through the Spirit<ul>
<li><a href="rom8.htm#2">Romans 8:2</a> -- &quot;Hath made me free&quot;
<li><a href="gal5.htm#16">Galatians 5:16</a> -- &quot;Shall not fulfil the lust of the flesh&quot;</ul>
