If [there be] therefore any consolation in Christ, if any comfort of love, if any fellowship of the Spirit, if any bowels and mercies,<br><a name="2">2</a>  Fulfil ye my joy, that ye be likeminded, having the same love, [being] of one accord, of one mind.<br><a name="3">3</a>  [Let] nothing [be done] through strife or vainglory; but in lowliness of mind let each esteem other better than themselves.<br><a name="4">4</a>  Look not every man on his own things, but every man also on the things of others.<br> <a name="5"></a>5  Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus:<br><a name="6">6</a>  Who, being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God:<br><a name="7">7</a>  But made himself of no reputation, and took upon him the form of a servant, and was made in the likeness of men:<br><a name="8">8</a>  And being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself, and became obedient unto death, even the death of the cross.<br><a name="9">9</a>  Wherefore God also hath highly exalted him, and given him a name which is above every name:<br><a name="10">10</a>  That at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of [things] in heaven, and [things] in earth, and [things] under the earth;<br><a name="11">11</a>  And [that] every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ [is] Lord, to the glory of God the Father.<br><a name="12">12</a>. Wherefore, my beloved, as ye have always obeyed, not as in my presence only, but now much more in my absence, work out your own salvation with fear and trembling.<br><a name="13">13</a>  For it is God which worketh in you both to will and to do of [his] good pleasure.<br><a name="14">14</a>. Do all things without murmurings and disputings:<br><a name="15">15</a>  That ye may be blameless and harmless, the sons of God, without rebuke, in the midst of a crooked and perverse nation, among whom ye shine as lights in the world;<br><a name="16">16</a>  Holding forth the word of life; that I may rejoice in the day of Christ, that I have not run in vain, neither laboured in vain.<br><a name="17">17</a>  Yea, and if I be offered upon the sacrifice and service of your faith, I joy, and rejoice with you all.<br><a name="18">18</a>  For the same cause also do ye joy, and rejoice with me.<br><a name="19">19</a>  But I trust in the Lord Jesus to send Timotheus shortly unto you, that I also may be of good comfort, when I know your state.<br><a name="20">20</a>  For I have no man likeminded, who will naturally care for your state.<br><a name="21">21</a>  For all seek their own, not the things which are Jesus Christ's.<br><a name="22">22</a>  But ye know the proof of him, that, as a son with the father, he hath served with me in the gospel.<br><a name="23">23</a>  Him therefore I hope to send presently, so soon as I shall see how it will go with me.<br><a name="24">24</a>  But I trust in the Lord that I also myself shall come shortly.<br><a name="25">25</a>  Yet I supposed it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus, my brother, and companion in labour, and fellowsoldier, but your messenger, and he that ministered to my wants.<br><a name="26">26</a>  For he longed after you all, and was full of heaviness, because that ye had heard that he had been sick.<br><a name="27">27</a>  For indeed he was sick nigh unto death: but God had mercy on him; and not on him only, but on me also, lest I should have sorrow upon sorrow.<br><a name="28">28</a>  I sent him therefore the more carefully, that, when ye see him again, ye may rejoice, and that I may be the less sorrowful.<br><a name="29">29</a>  Receive him therefore in the Lord with all gladness; and hold such in reputation:<br><a name="30">30</a>  Because for the work of Christ he was nigh unto death, not regarding his life, to supply your lack of service toward me.<br><br>Go to <A HREF="php3.htm#1">Philippians 3</A><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
