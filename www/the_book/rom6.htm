Romans   6<br> 1. What shall we say then? Shall we continue in sin, that grace may abound?<br><a name="2">2</a>  God forbid. How shall we, that are dead to sin, live any longer therein?<br><a name="3">3</a>  Know ye not, that so many of us as were baptized into Jesus Christ were baptized into his death?<br><a name="4">4</a>  Therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death: that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life.<br><a name="5">5</a>  For if we have been planted together in the likeness of his death, we shall be also [in the likeness] of [his] resurrection:<br><a name="6">6</a>  Knowing this, that our old man is crucified with [him], that the body of sin might be destroyed, that henceforth we should not serve sin.<br><a name="7">7</a>  For he that is dead is freed from sin.<br><a name="8">8</a>  Now if we be dead with Christ, we believe that we shall also live with him:<br><a name="9">9</a>  Knowing that Christ being raised from the dead dieth no more; death hath no more dominion over him.<br><a name="10">10</a>  For in that he died, he died unto sin once: but in that he liveth, he liveth unto God.<br><a name="11">11</a>  Likewise reckon ye also yourselves to be dead indeed unto sin, but alive unto God through Jesus Christ our Lord.<br><a name="12">12</a>  Let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body, that ye should obey it in the lusts thereof.<br><a name="13">13</a>  Neither yield ye your members [as] instruments of unrighteousness unto sin: but yield yourselves unto God, as those that are alive from the dead, and your members [as] instruments of righteousness unto God.<br><a name="14">14</a>  For sin shall not have dominion over you: for ye are not under the law, but under grace.<br><a name="15">15</a>  What then? shall we sin, because we are not under the law, but under grace? God forbid.<br><a name="16">16</a>  Know ye not, that to whom ye yield yourselves servants to obey, his servants ye are to whom ye obey; whether of sin unto death, or of obedience unto righteousness?<br><a name="17">17</a>  But God be thanked, that ye were the servants of sin, but ye have obeyed from the heart that form of doctrine which was delivered you.<br><a name="18">18</a>  Being then made free from sin, ye became the servants of righteousness.<br><a name="19">19</a>  I speak after the manner of men because of the infirmity of your flesh: for as ye have yielded your members servants to uncleanness and to iniquity unto iniquity; even so now yield your members servants to righteousness unto holiness.<br><a name="20">20</a>  For when ye were the servants of sin, ye were free from righteousness.<br><a name="21">21</a>  What fruit had ye then in those things whereof ye are now ashamed? for the end of those things [is] death.<br><a name="22">22</a>  But now being made free from sin, and become servants to God, ye have your fruit unto holiness, and the end everlasting life.<br><a name="23">23</a>  For the wages of sin [is] death; but the gift of God [is] eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.<br><br>Go to <a href="rom7.htm#1">Romans 7</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
