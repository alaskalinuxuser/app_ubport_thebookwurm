Numbers  14<br>1. And all the congregation lifted up their voice, and cried; and the people wept that night.<br><a name="2">2</a>  And all the children of Israel murmured against Moses and against Aaron: and the whole congregation said unto them, Would God that we had died in the land of Egypt! or would God we had died in this wilderness!<br><a name="3">3</a>  And wherefore hath the LORD brought us unto this land, to fall by the sword, that our wives and our children should be a prey? were it not better for us to return into Egypt?<br><a name="4">4</a>  And they said one to another, Let us make a captain, and let us return into Egypt.<br><a name="5">5</a>. Then Moses and Aaron fell on their faces before all the assembly of the congregation of the children of Israel.<br><a name="6">6</a>  And Joshua the son of Nun, and Caleb the son of Jephunneh, [which were] of them that searched the land, rent their clothes:<br><a name="7">7</a>  And they spake unto all the company of the children of Israel, saying, The land, which we passed through to search it, [is] an exceeding good land.<br><a name="8">8</a>  If the LORD delight in us, then he will bring us into this land, and give it us; a land which floweth with milk and honey.<br><a name="9">9</a>  Only rebel not ye against the LORD, neither fear ye the people of the land; for they [are] bread for us: their defence is departed from them, and the LORD [is] with us: fear them not.<br><a name="10">10</a>  But all the congregation bade stone them with stones. And the glory of the LORD appeared in the tabernacle of the congregation before all the children of Israel.<br><a name="11">11</a>. And the LORD said unto Moses, How long will this people provoke me? and how long will it be ere they believe me, for all the signs which I have shewed among them?<br><a name="12">12</a>  I will smite them with the pestilence, and disinherit them, and will make of thee a greater nation and mightier than they.<br><a name="13">13</a>  And Moses said unto the LORD, Then the Egyptians shall hear [it], (for thou broughtest up this people in thy might from among them;)<br><a name="14">14</a>  And they will tell [it] to the inhabitants of this land: [for] they have heard that thou LORD [art] among this people, that thou LORD art seen face to face, and [that] thy cloud standeth over them, and [that] thou goest before them, by day time in a pillar of a cloud, and in a pillar of fire by night.<br><a name="15">15</a>  Now [if] thou shalt kill [all] this people as one man, then the nations which have heard the fame of thee will speak, saying,<br><a name="16">16</a>  Because the LORD was not able to bring this people into the land which he sware unto them, therefore he hath slain them in the wilderness.<br><a name="17">17</a>  And now, I beseech thee, let the power of my Lord be great, according as thou hast spoken, saying,<br><a name="18">18</a>  The LORD [is] longsuffering, and of great mercy, forgiving iniquity and transgression, and by no means clearing [the guilty], visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth [generation].<br><a name="19">19</a>  Pardon, I beseech thee, the iniquity of this people according unto the greatness of thy mercy, and as thou hast forgiven this people, from Egypt even until now.<br><a name="20">20</a>. And the LORD said, I have pardoned according to thy word:<br><a name="21">21</a>  But [as] truly [as] I live, all the earth shall be filled with the glory of the LORD.<br><a name="22">22</a>  Because all those men which have seen my glory, and my miracles, which I did in Egypt and in the wilderness, and have tempted me now these ten times, and have not hearkened to my voice;<br><a name="23">23</a>  Surely they shall not see the land which I sware unto their fathers, neither shall any of them that provoked me see it:<br><a name="24">24</a>  But my servant Caleb, because he had another spirit with him, and hath followed me fully, him will I bring into the land whereinto he went; and his seed shall possess it.<br><a name="25">25</a>  (Now the Amalekites and the Canaanites dwelt in the valley.) To morrow turn you, and get you into the wilderness by the way of the Red sea.<br><a name="26">26</a>  And the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying,<br><a name="27">27</a>  How long [shall I bear with] this evil congregation, which murmur against me? I have heard the murmurings of the children of Israel, which they murmur against me.<br><a name="28">28</a>  Say unto them, [As truly as] I live, saith the LORD, as ye have spoken in mine ears, so will I do to you:<br><a name="29">29</a>  Your carcases shall fall in this wilderness; and all that were numbered of you, according to your whole number, from twenty years old and upward, which have murmured against me,<br><a name="30">30</a>  Doubtless ye shall not come into the land, [concerning] which I sware to make you dwell therein, save Caleb the son of Jephunneh, and Joshua the son of Nun.<br><a name="31">31</a>  But your little ones, which ye said should be a prey, them will I bring in, and they shall know the land which ye have despised.<br><a name="32">32</a>  But [as for] you, your carcases, they shall fall in this wilderness.<br><a name="33">33</a>  And your children shall wander in the wilderness forty years, and bear your whoredoms, until your carcases be wasted in the wilderness.<br><a name="34">34</a>  After the number of the days in which ye searched the land, [even] forty days, each day for a year, shall ye bear your iniquities, [even] forty years, and ye shall know my breach of promise.<br><a name="35">35</a>  I the LORD have said, I will surely do it unto all this evil congregation, that are gathered together against me: in this wilderness they shall be consumed, and there they shall die.<br><a name="36">36</a>. And the men, which Moses sent to search the land, who returned, and made all the congregation to murmur against him, by bringing up a slander upon the land,<br><a name="37">37</a>  Even those men that did bring up the evil report upon the land, died by the plague before the LORD.<br><a name="38">38</a>  But Joshua the son of Nun, and Caleb the son of Jephunneh, [which were] of the men that went to search the land, lived [still].<br><a name="39">39</a>  And Moses told these sayings unto all the children of Israel: and the people mourned greatly.<br><a name="40">40</a>  And they rose up early in the morning, and gat them up into the top of the mountain, saying, Lo, we [be here], and will go up unto the place which the LORD hath promised: for we have sinned.<br><a name="41">41</a>  And Moses said, Wherefore now do ye transgress the commandment of the LORD? but it shall not prosper.<br><a name="42">42</a>  Go not up, for the LORD [is] not among you; that ye be not smitten before your enemies.<br><a name="43">43</a>  For the Amalekites and the Canaanites [are] there before you, and ye shall fall by the sword: because ye are turned away from the LORD, therefore the LORD will not be with you.<br><a name="44">44</a>  But they presumed to go up unto the hill top: nevertheless the ark of the covenant of the LORD, and Moses, departed not out of the camp.<br><a name="45">45</a>  Then the Amalekites came down, and the Canaanites which dwelt in that hill, and smote them, and discomfited them, [even] unto Hormah.<br><br>Go to <a href="num15.htm#1">Numbers 15</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
