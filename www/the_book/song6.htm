Song of Solomon   6<br> 1. Whither is thy beloved gone, O thou fairest among women? whither is thy beloved turned aside? that we may seek him with thee.<br><a name="2">2</a>  My beloved is gone down into his garden, to the beds of spices, to feed in the gardens, and to gather lilies.<br><a name="3">3</a>  I [am] my beloved's, and my beloved [is] mine: he feedeth among the lilies.<br><a name="4">4</a>. Thou [art] beautiful, O my love, as Tirzah, comely as Jerusalem, terrible as [an army] with banners.<br><a name="5">5</a>  Turn away thine eyes from me, for they have overcome me: thy hair [is] as a flock of goats that appear from Gilead.<br><a name="6">6</a>  Thy teeth [are] as a flock of sheep which go up from the washing, whereof every one beareth twins, and [there is] not one barren among them.<br><a name="7">7</a>  As a piece of a pomegranate [are] thy temples within thy locks.<br><a name="8">8</a>  There are threescore queens, and fourscore concubines, and virgins without number.<br><a name="9">9</a>  My dove, my undefiled is [but] one; she [is] the [only] one of her mother, she [is] the choice [one] of her that bare her. The daughters saw her, and blessed her; [yea], the queens and the concubines, and they praised her.<br><a name="10">10</a>  Who [is] she [that] looketh forth as the morning, fair as the moon, clear as the sun, [and] terrible as [an army] with banners?<br><a name="11">11</a>. I went down into the garden of nuts to see the fruits of the valley, [and] to see whether the vine flourished, [and] the pomegranates budded.<br><a name="12">12</a>  Or ever I was aware, my soul made me [like] the chariots of Amminadib.<br><a name="13">13</a>  Return, return, O Shulamite; return, return, that we may look upon thee. What will ye see in the Shulamite? As it were the company of two armies.<br><br>Go to <a href="song7.htm#1">Song of Solomon 7</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
