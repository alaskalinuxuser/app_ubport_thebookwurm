Job  15<br>1. Then answered Eliphaz the Temanite, and said,<br><a name="2">2</a>  Should a wise man utter vain knowledge, and fill his belly with the east wind?<br><a name="3">3</a>  Should he reason with unprofitable talk? or with speeches wherewith he can do no good?<br><a name="4">4</a>  Yea, thou castest off fear, and restrainest prayer before God.<br><a name="5">5</a>  For thy mouth uttereth thine iniquity, and thou choosest the tongue of the crafty.<br><a name="6">6</a>  Thine own mouth condemneth thee, and not I: yea, thine own lips testify against thee.<br><a name="7">7</a>  [Art] thou the first man [that] was born? or wast thou made before the hills?<br><a name="8">8</a>  Hast thou heard the secret of God? and dost thou restrain wisdom to thyself?<br><a name="9">9</a>  What knowest thou, that we know not? [what] understandest thou, which [is] not in us?<br><a name="10">10</a>  With us [are] both the grayheaded and very aged men, much elder than thy father.<br><a name="11">11</a>  [Are] the consolations of God small with thee? is there any secret thing with thee?<br><a name="12">12</a>  Why doth thine heart carry thee away? and what do thy eyes wink at,<br><a name="13">13</a>  That thou turnest thy spirit against God, and lettest [such] words go out of thy mouth?<br><a name="14">14</a>  What [is] man, that he should be clean? and [he which is] born of a woman, that he should be righteous?<br><a name="15">15</a>  Behold, he putteth no trust in his saints; yea, the heavens are not clean in his sight.<br><a name="16">16</a>  How much more abominable and filthy [is] man, which drinketh iniquity like water?<br><a name="17">17</a>. I will shew thee, hear me; and that [which] I have seen I will declare;<br><a name="18">18</a>  Which wise men have told from their fathers, and have not hid [it]:<br><a name="19">19</a>  Unto whom alone the earth was given, and no stranger passed among them.<br><a name="20">20</a>  The wicked man travaileth with pain all [his] days, and the number of years is hidden to the oppressor.<br><a name="21">21</a>  A dreadful sound [is] in his ears: in prosperity the destroyer shall come upon him.<br><a name="22">22</a>  He believeth not that he shall return out of darkness, and he is waited for of the sword.<br><a name="23">23</a>  He wandereth abroad for bread, [saying], Where [is it]? he knoweth that the day of darkness is ready at his hand.<br><a name="24">24</a>  Trouble and anguish shall make him afraid; they shall prevail against him, as a king ready to the battle.<br><a name="25">25</a>  For he stretcheth out his hand against God, and strengtheneth himself against the Almighty.<br><a name="26">26</a>  He runneth upon him, [even] on [his] neck, upon the thick bosses of his bucklers:<br><a name="27">27</a>  Because he covereth his face with his fatness, and maketh collops of fat on [his] flanks.<br><a name="28">28</a>  And he dwelleth in desolate cities, [and] in houses which no man inhabiteth, which are ready to become heaps.<br><a name="29">29</a>  He shall not be rich, neither shall his substance continue, neither shall he prolong the perfection thereof upon the earth.<br><a name="30">30</a>  He shall not depart out of darkness; the flame shall dry up his branches, and by the breath of his mouth shall he go away.<br><a name="31">31</a>  Let not him that is deceived trust in vanity: for vanity shall be his recompence.<br><a name="32">32</a>  It shall be accomplished before his time, and his branch shall not be green.<br><a name="33">33</a>  He shall shake off his unripe grape as the vine, and shall cast off his flower as the olive.<br><a name="34">34</a>  For the congregation of hypocrites [shall be] desolate, and fire shall consume the tabernacles of bribery.<br><a name="35">35</a>  They conceive mischief, and bring forth vanity, and their belly prepareth deceit.<br><br>Go to <a href="job16.htm#1">Job 16</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
