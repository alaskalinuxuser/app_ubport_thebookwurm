2Corinthians   8<br> 1. Moreover, brethren, we do you to wit of the grace of God bestowed on the churches of Macedonia;<br><a name="2">2</a>  How that in a great trial of affliction the abundance of their joy and their deep poverty abounded unto the riches of their liberality.<br><a name="3">3</a>  For to [their] power, I bear record, yea, and beyond [their] power [they were] willing of themselves;<br><a name="4">4</a>  Praying us with much intreaty that we would receive the gift, and [take upon us] the fellowship of the ministering to the saints.<br><a name="5">5</a>  And [this they did], not as we hoped, but first gave their own selves to the Lord, and unto us by the will of God.<br><a name="6">6</a>  Insomuch that we desired Titus, that as he had begun, so he would also finish in you the same grace also.<br><a name="7">7</a>. Therefore, as ye abound in every [thing, in] faith, and utterance, and knowledge, and [in] all diligence, and [in] your love to us, [see] that ye abound in this grace also.<br><a name="8">8</a>  I speak not by commandment, but by occasion of the forwardness of others, and to prove the sincerity of your love.<br><a name="9">9</a>  For ye know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that, though he was rich, yet for your sakes he became poor, that ye through his poverty might be rich.<br><a name="10">10</a>  And herein I give [my] advice: for this is expedient for you, who have begun before, not only to do, but also to be forward a year ago.<br><a name="11">11</a>  Now therefore perform the doing [of it]; that as [there was] a readiness to will, so [there may be] a performance also out of that which ye have.<br><a name="12">12</a>  For if there be first a willing mind, [it is] accepted according to that a man hath, [and] not according to that he hath not.<br><a name="13">13</a>  For [I mean] not that other men be eased, and ye burdened:<br><a name="14">14</a>  But by an equality, [that] now at this time your abundance [may be a supply] for their want, that their abundance also may be [a supply] for your want: that there may be equality:<br><a name="15">15</a>  As it is written, He that [had gathered] much had nothing over; and he that [had gathered] little had no lack.<br><a name="16">16</a>. But thanks [be] to God, which put the same earnest care into the heart of Titus for you.<br><a name="17">17</a>  For indeed he accepted the exhortation; but being more forward, of his own accord he went unto you.<br><a name="18">18</a>  And we have sent with him the brother, whose praise [is] in the gospel throughout all the churches;<br><a name="19">19</a>  And not [that] only, but who was also chosen of the churches to travel with us with this grace, which is administered by us to the glory of the same Lord, and [declaration of] your ready mind:<br><a name="20">20</a>  Avoiding this, that no man should blame us in this abundance which is administered by us:<br><a name="21">21</a>  Providing for honest things, not only in the sight of the Lord, but also in the sight of men.<br><a name="22">22</a>  And we have sent with them our brother, whom we have oftentimes proved diligent in many things, but now much more diligent, upon the great confidence which [I have] in you.<br><a name="23">23</a>  Whether [any do enquire] of Titus, [he is] my partner and fellowhelper concerning you: or our brethren [be enquired of, they are] the messengers of the churches, [and] the glory of Christ.<br><a name="24">24</a>  Wherefore shew ye to them, and before the churches, the proof of your love, and of our boasting on your behalf.<br><br>Go to <a href="2cor9.htm#1">II Corinthians 9</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
