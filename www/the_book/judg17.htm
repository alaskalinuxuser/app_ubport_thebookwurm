Judges  17<br>1. And there was a man of mount Ephraim, whose name [was] Micah.<br><a name="2">2</a>  And he said unto his mother, The eleven hundred [shekels] of silver that were taken from thee, about which thou cursedst, and spakest of also in mine ears, behold, the silver [is] with me; I took it. And his mother said, Blessed [be thou] of the LORD, my son.<br><a name="3">3</a>  And when he had restored the eleven hundred [shekels] of silver to his mother, his mother said, I had wholly dedicated the silver unto the LORD from my hand for my son, to make a graven image and a molten image: now therefore I will restore it unto thee.<br><a name="4">4</a>  Yet he restored the money unto his mother; and his mother took two hundred [shekels] of silver, and gave them to the founder, who made thereof a graven image and a molten image: and they were in the house of Micah.<br><a name="5">5</a>  And the man Micah had an house of gods, and made an ephod, and teraphim, and consecrated one of his sons, who became his priest.<br><a name="6">6</a>  In those days [there was] no king in Israel, [but] every man did [that which was] right in his own eyes.<br><a name="7">7</a>. And there was a young man out of Bethlehemjudah of the family of Judah, who [was] a Levite, and he sojourned there.<br><a name="8">8</a>  And the man departed out of the city from Bethlehemjudah to sojourn where he could find [a place]: and he came to mount Ephraim to the house of Micah, as he journeyed.<br><a name="9">9</a>  And Micah said unto him, Whence comest thou? And he said unto him, I [am] a Levite of Bethlehemjudah, and I go to sojourn where I may find [a place].<br><a name="10">10</a>  And Micah said unto him, Dwell with me, and be unto me a father and a priest, and I will give thee ten [shekels] of silver by the year, and a suit of apparel, and thy victuals. So the Levite went in.<br><a name="11">11</a>  And the Levite was content to dwell with the man; and the young man was unto him as one of his sons.<br><a name="12">12</a>  And Micah consecrated the Levite; and the young man became his priest, and was in the house of Micah.<br><a name="13">13</a>  Then said Micah, Now know I that the LORD will do me good, seeing I have a Levite to [my] priest.<br><br>Go to <a href="judg18.htm#1">Judges 18</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
