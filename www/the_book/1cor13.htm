1Corinthians  13<br>1. Though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, and have not charity, I am become [as] sounding brass, or a tinkling cymbal.<br><a name="2">2</a>  And though I have [the gift of] prophecy, and understand all mysteries, and all knowledge; and though I have all faith, so that I could remove mountains, and have not charity, I am nothing.<br><a name="3">3</a>  And though I bestow all my goods to feed [the poor], and though I give my body to be burned, and have not charity, it profiteth me nothing.<br><a name="4">4</a>. Charity suffereth long, [and] is kind; charity envieth not; charity vaunteth not itself, is not puffed up,<br><a name="5">5</a>  Doth not behave itself unseemly, seeketh not her own, is not easily provoked, thinketh no evil;<br><a name="6">6</a>  Rejoiceth not in iniquity, but rejoiceth in the truth;<br><a name="7">7</a>  Beareth all things, believeth all things, hopeth all things, endureth all things.<br><a name="8">8</a>. Charity never faileth: but whether [there be] prophecies, they shall fail; whether [there be] tongues, they shall cease; whether [there be] knowledge, it shall vanish away.<br><a name="9">9</a>  For we know in part, and we prophesy in part.<br><a name="10">10</a>  But when that which is perfect is come, then that which is in part shall be done away.<br><a name="11">11</a>  When I was a child, I spake as a child, I understood as a child, I thought as a child: but when I became a man, I put away childish things.<br><a name="12">12</a>  For now we see through a glass, darkly; but then face to face: now I know in part; but then shall I know even as also I am known.<br><a name="13">13</a>  And now abideth faith, hope, charity, these three; but the greatest of these [is] charity.<br><br>Go to <a href="1cor14.htm#1">I Corinthians 14</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
