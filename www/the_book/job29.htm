Job  29<br>1. Moreover Job continued his parable, and said,<br><a name="2">2</a>  Oh that I were as [in] months past, as [in] the days [when] God preserved me;<br><a name="3">3</a>  When his candle shined upon my head, [and when] by his light I walked [through] darkness;<br><a name="4">4</a>  As I was in the days of my youth, when the secret of God [was] upon my tabernacle;<br><a name="5">5</a>  When the Almighty [was] yet with me, [when] my children [were] about me;<br><a name="6">6</a>  When I washed my steps with butter, and the rock poured me out rivers of oil;<br><a name="7">7</a>. When I went out to the gate through the city, [when] I prepared my seat in the street!<br><a name="8">8</a>  The young men saw me, and hid themselves: and the aged arose, [and] stood up.<br><a name="9">9</a>  The princes refrained talking, and laid [their] hand on their mouth.<br><a name="10">10</a>  The nobles held their peace, and their tongue cleaved to the roof of their mouth.<br><a name="11">11</a>  When the ear heard [me], then it blessed me; and when the eye saw [me], it gave witness to me:<br><a name="12">12</a>  Because I delivered the poor that cried, and the fatherless, and [him that had] none to help him.<br><a name="13">13</a>  The blessing of him that was ready to perish came upon me: and I caused the widow's heart to sing for joy.<br><a name="14">14</a>  I put on righteousness, and it clothed me: my judgment [was] as a robe and a diadem.<br><a name="15">15</a>  I was eyes to the blind, and feet [was] I to the lame.<br><a name="16">16</a>  I [was] a father to the poor: and the cause [which] I knew not I searched out.<br><a name="17">17</a>  And I brake the jaws of the wicked, and plucked the spoil out of his teeth.<br><a name="18">18</a>. Then I said, I shall die in my nest, and I shall multiply [my] days as the sand.<br><a name="19">19</a>  My root [was] spread out by the waters, and the dew lay all night upon my branch.<br><a name="20">20</a>  My glory [was] fresh in me, and my bow was renewed in my hand.<br><a name="21">21</a>  Unto me [men] gave ear, and waited, and kept silence at my counsel.<br><a name="22">22</a>  After my words they spake not again; and my speech dropped upon them.<br><a name="23">23</a>  And they waited for me as for the rain; and they opened their mouth wide [as] for the latter rain.<br><a name="24">24</a>  [If] I laughed on them, they believed [it] not; and the light of my countenance they cast not down.<br><a name="25">25</a>  I chose out their way, and sat chief, and dwelt as a king in the army, as one [that] comforteth the mourners.<br><br>Go to <a href="job30.htm#1">Job 30</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
