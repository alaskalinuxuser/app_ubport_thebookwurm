Job  19<br>1. Then Job answered and said,<br><a name="2">2</a>  How long will ye vex my soul, and break me in pieces with words?<br><a name="3">3</a>  These ten times have ye reproached me: ye are not ashamed [that] ye make yourselves strange to me.<br><a name="4">4</a>  And be it indeed [that] I have erred, mine error remaineth with myself.<br><a name="5">5</a>  If indeed ye will magnify [yourselves] against me, and plead against me my reproach:<br><a name="6">6</a>  Know now that God hath overthrown me, and hath compassed me with his net.<br><a name="7">7</a>  Behold, I cry out of wrong, but I am not heard: I cry aloud, but [there is] no judgment.<br><a name="8">8</a>. He hath fenced up my way that I cannot pass, and he hath set darkness in my paths.<br><a name="9">9</a>  He hath stripped me of my glory, and taken the crown [from] my head.<br><a name="10">10</a>  He hath destroyed me on every side, and I am gone: and mine hope hath he removed like a tree.<br><a name="11">11</a>  He hath also kindled his wrath against me, and he counteth me unto him as [one of] his enemies.<br><a name="12">12</a>  His troops come together, and raise up their way against me, and encamp round about my tabernacle.<br><a name="13">13</a>  He hath put my brethren far from me, and mine acquaintance are verily estranged from me.<br><a name="14">14</a>  My kinsfolk have failed, and my familiar friends have forgotten me.<br><a name="15">15</a>  They that dwell in mine house, and my maids, count me for a stranger: I am an alien in their sight.<br><a name="16">16</a>  I called my servant, and he gave [me] no answer; I intreated him with my mouth.<br><a name="17">17</a>  My breath is strange to my wife, though I intreated for the children's [sake] of mine own body.<br><a name="18">18</a>  Yea, young children despised me; I arose, and they spake against me.<br><a name="19">19</a>  All my inward friends abhorred me: and they whom I loved are turned against me.<br><a name="20">20</a>  My bone cleaveth to my skin and to my flesh, and I am escaped with the skin of my teeth.<br><a name="21">21</a>  Have pity upon me, have pity upon me, O ye my friends; for the hand of God hath touched me.<br><a name="22">22</a>  Why do ye persecute me as God, and are not satisfied with my flesh?<br><a name="23">23</a>. Oh that my words were now written! oh that they were printed in a book!<br><a name="24">24</a>  That they were graven with an iron pen and lead in the rock for ever!<br><a name="25">25</a>  For I know [that] my redeemer liveth, and [that] he shall stand at the latter [day] upon the earth:<br><a name="26">26</a>  And [though] after my skin [worms] destroy this [body], yet in my flesh shall I see God:<br><a name="27">27</a>  Whom I shall see for myself, and mine eyes shall behold, and not another; [though] my reins be consumed within me.<br><a name="28">28</a>  But ye should say, Why persecute we him, seeing the root of the matter is found in me?<br><a name="29">29</a>  Be ye afraid of the sword: for wrath [bringeth] the punishments of the sword, that ye may know [there is] a judgment.<br><br>Go to <a href="job20.htm#1">Job 20</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
