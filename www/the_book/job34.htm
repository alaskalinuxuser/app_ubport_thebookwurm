Job  34<br>1. Furthermore Elihu answered and said,<br><a name="2">2</a>  Hear my words, O ye wise [men]; and give ear unto me, ye that have knowledge.<br><a name="3">3</a>  For the ear trieth words, as the mouth tasteth meat.<br><a name="4">4</a>  Let us choose to us judgment: let us know among ourselves what [is] good.<br><a name="5">5</a>  For Job hath said, I am righteous: and God hath taken away my judgment.<br><a name="6">6</a>  Should I lie against my right? my wound [is] incurable without transgression.<br><a name="7">7</a>  What man [is] like Job, [who] drinketh up scorning like water?<br><a name="8">8</a>  Which goeth in company with the workers of iniquity, and walketh with wicked men.<br><a name="9">9</a>  For he hath said, It profiteth a man nothing that he should delight himself with God.<br><a name="10">10</a>. Therefore hearken unto me, ye men of understanding: far be it from God, [that he should do] wickedness; and [from] the Almighty, [that he should commit] iniquity.<br><a name="11">11</a>  For the work of a man shall he render unto him, and cause every man to find according to [his] ways.<br><a name="12">12</a>  Yea, surely God will not do wickedly, neither will the Almighty pervert judgment.<br><a name="13">13</a>  Who hath given him a charge over the earth? or who hath disposed the whole world?<br><a name="14">14</a>  If he set his heart upon man, [if] he gather unto himself his spirit and his breath;<br><a name="15">15</a>  All flesh shall perish together, and man shall turn again unto dust.<br><a name="16">16</a>. If now [thou hast] understanding, hear this: hearken to the voice of my words.<br><a name="17">17</a>  Shall even he that hateth right govern? and wilt thou condemn him that is most just?<br><a name="18">18</a>  [Is it fit] to say to a king, [Thou art] wicked? [and] to princes, [Ye are] ungodly?<br><a name="19">19</a>  [How much less to him] that accepteth not the persons of princes, nor regardeth the rich more than the poor? for they all [are] the work of his hands.<br><a name="20">20</a>  In a moment shall they die, and the people shall be troubled at midnight, and pass away: and the mighty shall be taken away without hand.<br><a name="21">21</a>  For his eyes [are] upon the ways of man, and he seeth all his goings.<br><a name="22">22</a>  [There is] no darkness, nor shadow of death, where the workers of iniquity may hide themselves.<br><a name="23">23</a>  For he will not lay upon man more [than right]; that he should enter into judgment with God.<br><a name="24">24</a>  He shall break in pieces mighty men without number, and set others in their stead.<br><a name="25">25</a>  Therefore he knoweth their works, and he overturneth [them] in the night, so that they are destroyed.<br><a name="26">26</a>  He striketh them as wicked men in the open sight of others;<br><a name="27">27</a>  Because they turned back from him, and would not consider any of his ways:<br><a name="28">28</a>  So that they cause the cry of the poor to come unto him, and he heareth the cry of the afflicted.<br><a name="29">29</a>  When he giveth quietness, who then can make trouble? and when he hideth [his] face, who then can behold him? whether [it be done] against a nation, or against a man only:<br><a name="30">30</a>  That the hypocrite reign not, lest the people be ensnared.<br><a name="31">31</a>. Surely it is meet to be said unto God, I have borne [chastisement], I will not offend [any more]:<br><a name="32">32</a>  [That which] I see not teach thou me: if I have done iniquity, I will do no more.<br><a name="33">33</a>  [Should it be] according to thy mind? he will recompense it, whether thou refuse, or whether thou choose; and not I: therefore speak what thou knowest.<br><a name="34">34</a>  Let men of understanding tell me, and let a wise man hearken unto me.<br><a name="35">35</a>  Job hath spoken without knowledge, and his words [were] without wisdom.<br><a name="36">36</a>  My desire [is that] Job may be tried unto the end because of [his] answers for wicked men.<br><a name="37">37</a>  For he addeth rebellion unto his sin, he clappeth [his hands] among us, and multiplieth his words against God.<br><br>Go to <a href="job35.htm#1">Job 35</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
