Psalms   4<br>1. To the chief Musician on Neginoth, A Psalm of David. Hear me when I call, O God of my righteousness: thou hast enlarged me [when I was] in distress; have mercy upon me, and hear my prayer.<br><a name="2">2</a>  O ye sons of men, how long [will ye turn] my glory into shame? [how long] will ye love vanity, [and] seek after leasing? Selah.<br><a name="3">3</a>  But know that the LORD hath set apart him that is godly for himself: the LORD will hear when I call unto him.<br><a name="4">4</a>  Stand in awe, and sin not: commune with your own heart upon your bed, and be still. Selah.<br><a name="5">5</a>  Offer the sacrifices of righteousness, and put your trust in the LORD.<br><a name="6">6</a>. [There be] many that say, Who will shew us [any] good? LORD, lift thou up the light of thy countenance upon us.<br><a name="7">7</a>  Thou hast put gladness in my heart, more than in the time [that] their corn and their wine increased.<br><a name="8">8</a>  I will both lay me down in peace, and sleep: for thou, LORD, only makest me dwell in safety.<br><br>Go to <a href="psa5.htm#1">Psalm 5</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
