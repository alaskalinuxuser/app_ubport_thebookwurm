And the third day there was a marriage in Cana of Galilee; and the mother of Jesus was there:<br><a name="2">2</a>  And both Jesus was called, and his disciples, to the marriage.<br><a name="3">3</a>  And when they wanted wine, the mother of Jesus saith unto him, They have no wine.<br><a name="4">4</a>  Jesus saith unto her, Woman, what have I to do with thee? mine hour is not yet come.<br><a name="5">5</a>  His mother saith unto the servants, Whatsoever he saith unto you, do [it].<br><a name="6">6</a>  And there were set there six waterpots of stone, after the manner of the purifying of the Jews, containing two or three firkins apiece.<br><a name="7">7</a>  Jesus saith unto them, Fill the waterpots with water. And they filled them up to the brim.<br><a name="8">8</a>  And he saith unto them, Draw out now, and bear unto the governor of the feast. And they bare [it].<br><a name="9">9</a>  When the ruler of the feast had tasted the water that was made wine, and knew not whence it was: (but the servants which drew the water knew;) the governor of the feast called the bridegroom,<br><a name="10">10</a>  And saith unto him, Every man at the beginning doth set forth good wine; and when men have well drunk, then that which is worse: [but] thou hast kept the good wine until now.<br><a name="11">11</a>  This beginning of miracles did Jesus in Cana of Galilee, and manifested forth his glory; and his disciples believed on him.<br><a name="12">12</a>. After this he went down to Capernaum, he, and his mother, and his brethren, and his disciples: and they continued there not many days.<br><a name="13">13</a>  And the Jews' passover was at hand, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem,<br><a name="14">14</a>  And found in the temple those that sold oxen and sheep and doves, and the changers of money sitting:<br><a name="15">15</a>  And when he had made a scourge of small cords, he drove them all out of the temple, and the sheep, and the oxen; and poured out the changers' money, and overthrew the tables;<br><a name="16">16</a>  And said unto them that sold doves, Take these things hence; make not my Father's house an house of merchandise.<br><a name="17">17</a>  And his disciples remembered that it was written, The zeal of thine house hath eaten me up.<br><a name="18">18</a>  Then answered the Jews and said unto him, What sign shewest thou unto us, seeing that thou doest these things?<br> <a name="19"></a>19  Jesus answered and said unto them, Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up.<br><a name="20">20</a>  Then said the Jews, Forty and six years was this temple in building, and wilt thou rear it up in three days?<br><a name="21">21</a>  But he spake of the temple of his body.<br><a name="22">22</a>  When therefore he was risen from the dead, his disciples remembered that he had said this unto them; and they believed the scripture, and the word which Jesus had said.<br><a name="23">23</a>. Now when he was in Jerusalem at the passover, in the feast [day], many believed in his name, when they saw the miracles which he did.<br><a name="24">24</a>  But Jesus did not commit himself unto them, because he knew all [men],<br><a name="25">25</a>  And needed not that any should testify of man: for he knew what was in man.<br><br>Go to <a href="joh3.htm#1">John 3</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
