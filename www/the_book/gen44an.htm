<dt><b><i>44:1 And he commanded the steward of his house, saying,<br>Fill the men's sacks [with] food, as much as they can carry,<br>and put every man's money in his sack's mouth.<br>
44:2 And put my cup, the silver cup, in the sack's mouth of the youngest, and his corn money.<br>And he did according to the word that Joseph had spoken.<br>
44:3 As soon as the morning was light, the men were sent away, they and their asses.<br>
44:4 [And] when they were gone out of the city, [and] not [yet] far off, Joseph said unto his steward,<br>Up, follow after the men; and when thou dost overtake them, say unto them,<br>Wherefore have ye rewarded evil for good?<br>
44:5 [Is] not this [it] in which my lord drinketh, and whereby indeed he divineth?<br>ye have done evil in so doing.</i></b></dt><dl>
<dt>Joseph continued to test his brothers regarding their love for Benjamin and for their father.
<dd>''Remember, they sold <i>him</i> into slavery. Have they changed?<br>Will they be willing to let Benjamin go into slavery to save themselves?'' [McGee]
<dt>whereby... he divineth- Joseph was a prophet who was instructed by God's Spirit.
<dd>He did not need to read tea leaves in a cup. But for the purpose of the 'accusation' against the 'thief,' assigning such a purpose to this cup raised its value above that of a silver drinking cup.
</dl><dt>
<b><i>44:6 And he overtook them, and he spake unto them these same words.<br>
44:7 And they said unto him, Wherefore saith my lord these words?<br>God forbid that thy servants should do according to this thing:<br>
44:8 Behold, the money, which we found in our sacks' mouths,<br>we brought again unto thee out of the land of Canaan:<br>how then should we steal out of thy lord's house silver or gold?<br>
44:9 With whomsoever of thy servants it be found, both let him die,<br>and we also will be my lord's bondmen.<br>
44:10 And he said, Now also [let] it [be] according unto your words:<br>he with whom it is found shall be my servant; and ye shall be blameless.<br>
44:11 Then they speedily took down every man his sack to the ground, and opened every man his sack.<br>
44:12 And he searched, [and] began at the eldest, and left at the youngest:<br>and the cup was found in Benjamin's sack.<br>
44:13 Then they rent their clothes, and laded every man his ass, and returned to the city.</i></b></dt><dl>
<dt>All of the brothers returned. They had no intention of leaving Benjamin behind.
</dl><dt>
<b><i>44:14 And Judah and his brethren came to Joseph's house; for he [was] yet there:<br>and they fell before him on the ground.<br>
44:15 And Joseph said unto them, What deed [is] this that ye have done?<br>wot </b></i>{ie., know}<i><b> ye not that such a man as I can certainly divine?<br>
44:16 And Judah said, What shall we say unto my lord?<br>what shall we speak? or how shall we clear ourselves?<br>God hath found out the iniquity of thy servants:<br>behold, we [are] my lord's servants, both we, and [he] also with whom the cup is found.<br>
44:17 And he said, God forbid that I should do so:<br>[but] the man in whose hand the cup is found, he shall be my servant;<br>and as for you, get you up in peace unto your father.</b></i></dt><dl>
<dt>Joseph presses the test. You are free to go, if only you forsake Benjamin.
</dl><dt>
<i><b>44:18 Then Judah came near unto him, and said,<br>
Oh my lord, let thy servant, I pray thee, speak a word in my lord's ears,<br>and let not thine anger burn against thy servant: for thou [art] even as Pharaoh.<br>
44:19 My lord asked his servants, saying, Have ye a father, or a brother?<br>
44:20 And we said unto my lord,<br>We have a father, an old man, and a child of his old age, a little one;<br>and his brother is dead, and he alone is left of his mother, and his father loveth him.<br>
44:21 And thou saidst unto thy servants,<br>Bring him down unto me, that I may set mine eyes upon him.<br>
44:22 And we said unto my lord,<br>The lad cannot leave his father: for [if] he should leave his father, [his father] would die.<br>
44:23 And thou saidst unto thy servants,<br>
Except your youngest brother come down with you, ye shall see my face no more.<br>
44:24 And it came to pass when we came up unto thy servant my father,<br>we told him the words of my lord.<br>
44:25 And our father said, Go again, [and] buy us a little food.<br>
44:26 And we said, We cannot go down: if our youngest brother be with us, then will we go down:<br>for we may not see the man's face, except our youngest brother [be] with us.<br>
44:27 And thy servant my father said unto us, Ye know that my wife bare me two [sons]:<br>
44:28 And the one went out from me, and I said, Surely he is torn in pieces; and I saw him not since:<br>
44:29 And if ye take this also from me, and mischief befall him,<br>ye shall bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to the grave.<br>
44:30 Now therefore when I come to thy servant my father, and the lad [be] not with us;<br>seeing that his life is bound up in the lad's life;<br>
44:31 It shall come to pass, when he seeth that the lad [is] not [with us], that he will die:<br>and thy servants shall bring down the gray hairs of thy servant our father with sorrow to the grave.<br>
44:32 For thy servant became surety for the lad unto my father, saying,<br>If I bring him not unto thee, then I shall bear the blame to my father for ever.<br>
44:33 Now therefore, I pray thee, let thy servant abide instead of the lad a bondman to my lord;<br>and let the lad go up with his brethren.<br>
44:34 For how shall I go up to my father, and the lad [be] not with me?<br>lest peradventure I see the evil that shall come on my father.</i></b></dt><dl>
<dt>Judah's eloquent appeal gives evidence that God has been at work in his heart.
<dd>Once he had played a major part in selling Joseph into slavery, and bringing sorrow upon his father's heart (<a href="gen37.htm#26">37:26,27</a>).<dd>Once, he had lived for his own selfish pleasures (ch.38).<dd>
But now, speaking with humble nobility,<ul>
<li>he confesses sin. The brothers were guilty, not of theft (<a href="gen44.htm#8" target="lwr_lt">v.8</a>), but of selling Joseph (<a href="gen44.htm#16" target="lwr_lt">v.16</a>; <a href="gen42.htm#21">42:21</a>).
<li>he verbalizes the lie, which the brothers had presented to Jacob (<a href="gen44.htm#28" target="lwr_lt">v.28</a>). Until now, Joseph was unaware of what Jacob had been told concerning his disappearance.
<li>he speaks out of genuine love for his father and for his wellbeing. <a href="gen44.htm#30" target="lwr_lt">v.30,31</a>
<li>he pleads to be allowed to become a slave in the stead of Benjamin. <a href="gen44.htm#32" target="lwr_lt">v.32,33</a><br>
Here, Judah foreshadows the 'Lion of the tribe of Judah' who would come to take the sinner's place. cp. <a href="rom5.htm#8">Rom 5:8</a>; <a href="rev5.htm#5">Rev 5:5,6</a></ul>
