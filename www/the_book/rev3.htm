If therefore thou shalt not watch, I will come on thee as a thief, and thou shalt not know what hour I will come upon thee.<br><a name="4">4</a>  Thou hast a few names even in Sardis which have not defiled their garments; and they shall walk with me in white: for they are worthy.<br><a name="5">5</a>  He that overcometh, the same shall be clothed in white raiment; and I will not blot out his name out of the book of life, but I will confess his name before my Father, and before his angels.<br><a name="6">6</a>  He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches.<br><a name="7">7</a>.
