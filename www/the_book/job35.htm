Job  35<br>1. Elihu spake moreover, and said,<br><a name="2">2</a>  Thinkest thou this to be right, [that] thou saidst, My righteousness [is] more than God's?<br><a name="3">3</a>  For thou saidst, What advantage will it be unto thee? [and], What profit shall I have, [if I be cleansed] from my sin?<br><a name="4">4</a>  I will answer thee, and thy companions with thee.<br><a name="5">5</a>  Look unto the heavens, and see; and behold the clouds [which] are higher than thou.<br><a name="6">6</a>  If thou sinnest, what doest thou against him? or [if] thy transgressions be multiplied, what doest thou unto him?<br><a name="7">7</a>  If thou be righteous, what givest thou him? or what receiveth he of thine hand?<br><a name="8">8</a>  Thy wickedness [may hurt] a man as thou [art]; and thy righteousness [may profit] the son of man.<br><a name="9">9</a>. By reason of the multitude of oppressions they make [the oppressed] to cry: they cry out by reason of the arm of the mighty.<br><a name="10">10</a>  But none saith, Where [is] God my maker, who giveth songs in the night;<br><a name="11">11</a>  Who teacheth us more than the beasts of the earth, and maketh us wiser than the fowls of heaven?<br><a name="12">12</a>  There they cry, but none giveth answer, because of the pride of evil men.<br><a name="13">13</a>  Surely God will not hear vanity, neither will the Almighty regard it.<br><a name="14">14</a>. Although thou sayest thou shalt not see him, [yet] judgment [is] before him; therefore trust thou in him.<br><a name="15">15</a>  But now, because [it is] not [so], he hath visited in his anger; yet he knoweth [it] not in great extremity:<br><a name="16">16</a>  Therefore doth Job open his mouth in vain; he multiplieth words without knowledge.<br><br>Go to <a href="job36.htm#1">Job 36</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
