<dt><i><b>118:1 O give thanks unto the LORD;<br>
for [he is] good:<br>
because his mercy [endureth] for ever.<br> 
118:2 Let Israel now say, that his mercy [endureth] for ever.<br>
118:3 Let the house of Aaron now say, that his mercy [endureth] for ever.<br>
118:4 Let them now that fear the LORD say, that his mercy [endureth] for ever. </b></i></dt><dl>
<dt>mercy- How often do we take God's mercy for granted?... 
<dd>. . . &quot;Of course, God's mercy is forever, God's business is forgiving, isn't it?&quot; 
<dd>We forget that God's Truth &amp; Mercy are in constant tension.
<dd>Like an immovable rock, Truth is hard, unbending, unforgiving.
<dd>God cannot ignore the guilt of the guilty, for that would be a lie. <a href="ex34.htm#7">Ex 34:7</a>
<dd>He can forgive our sin, only if our sinfulness and guilt are first removed.
<dd>That is exactly what He did, in the Person of Jesus Christ, who took our sin and guilt upon Himself, bearing their consequences and removing them far from us.
<dd><a href="psa85.htm#10">Psa 85:10</a>; <a href="psa117.htm#1">Psa 117:1,2</a>; <a href="joh1.htm#17">Joh 1:17</a>
<dt>Let Israel... the house of Aaron... them that fear the Lord... say... -
<dd>The mercy of God which endures the test of His truth is needed by all men,
<dd>whether they be Israelites, even the Priests of Israel, or gentiles.
<dd>It is available to all who acknowledge their need and accept His provision, by faith.</dl>
<dt><i><b>118:5 I called upon the LORD in distress:<br>
the LORD answered me, [and set me] in a large place. </b></i></dt><dl>
<dt>I called...- This is a word of testimony:<dd>The voice could be yours, mine, or any among the redeemed (vs. 2-4).
<dd>But here, above our mingled voices, is heard the voice of the One who &quot;hath borne our sorrows.&quot;
<dt>This Psalm, as the last of the Hallel Psalms, was customarily sung following
<dd>the Passover meal. It is, no doubt, the hymn mentioned in the Gospels:
<dd><a href="mat26.htm#30">Mat 26:30</a>; <a href="mar14.htm#26">Mark 14:26</a>
<dt>in distress...- HB= metsar, a narrow place, a strait.
<dd>This is an apt description of Jesus' agony in Gethsemane {which means &quot;the olive press&quot;}.<br>cp. <a href="mat26.htm#36">Mat 26:36,38</a>; <a href="luk22.htm#41">Luk 22:41-44</a>
<dt>the LORD answered me... in a large place.-
<dd>In answer to the prayer of faith, the LORD released the oppressed One from the narrow straits where He was trapped, and gave Him broad freedom in a wide place. As we have seen in previous psalms, this was our Savior's experience, when he was released from death (eg., <a href="psa40.htm#1"> Psa 40:1-3</a>; <a href="psa116.htm#3">Psa 116:3-8</a>). Through faith in Him, the believer, is also set free from bondage to sin, to serve the Lord. eg., <a href="joh8.htm#34">Joh 8:34-36</a>; <a href="gal5.htm#1">Gal 5:1</a></dl>
<dt><b><i>118:6 The LORD [is] on my side;<br>
I will not fear: what can man do unto me? </b></i>
<dd>cp. <a href="joh19.htm#10">Joh 19:10,11</a>; <a href="heb13.htm#6">Heb 13:6</a><br>
<dt><i><b>118:7 The LORD taketh my part with them that help me:<br>
therefore shall I see [my desire] upon them that hate me.<br>
118:8 [It is] better to trust in the LORD than to put confidence in man. </b></i></dt><dl>
<dt>man - Whether enemy or friend, men will disappoint you.
<dd>The closest friend may forsake you, proving himself unfaithful.<dd>Even a faithful friend will fail you, in the end.<dd>Men failed Jesus. He did not place His confidence in men. 
<dd><a href="psa41.htm#9">Psa 41:9</a>; <a href="psa55.htm#12">Psa 55:12-14</a>; <a href="mar14.htm#50">Mark 14:50</a>; <a href="joh2.htm#24">Joh 2:24,25</a>; <a href="jer17.htm#5">Jer 17:5-7</a> </dl>
<dt><i><b>118:9 [It is] better to trust in the LORD than to put confidence in princes. </b></i></dt><dl>
<dt>princes- the keepers of Law &amp; Justice may fail (eg., the Sanhedrin, Pilate, Herod).
<dd> <a href="joh19.htm#6">Joh 19:6</a> </dl>
<dt><i><b>118:10 All nations compassed me about: </b></i></dt><dl>
<dt>all nations- Rome (a nation of many gentile nations) &amp; Israel were united against Christ.
<dt>compassed- surrounded, encompassed
<dd><a href="psa2.htm#1">Psa 2:1-3</a>; <a href="psa22.htm#12">Psa 22:12-16</a></dl>
<dt><i><b>but in the name of the LORD will I destroy them. </b></i></dt><dl>
<dt>destroy {HB= mul, cut off, circumcise} - This word occurs 3x in v.10-12.<ul>
<li>Christ came not to condemn, but to save the world, which is already condemned. <a href="joh3.htm#17">Joh 3:17-20</a>
<li>He came to bring all things into subjection to the Father's will (<a href="1cor15.htm#25">1Cor 15:25-28</a>).
<br>The fleshly mind is contrary to the Spirit and cannot be brought into subjection to God. <a href="rom8.htm#5">Rom 8:5-9</a>
<li>So, in the name of the LORD, Christ will either 'destroy' {cut off} all who rebel against God,
<br>or, He will 'circumcise' the hearts {cutting off the fleshly nature} of those who turn to Him (<a href="deu30.htm#6">Deu 30:6</a>; <a href="col2.htm#11">Col 2:11,12</a>).
<li>The triple repetition of this phrase (in <a href="psa118.htm#10" target="lwr_lt">v.10-12</a>) declares that the destruction of His enemies is absolutely certain. <a href="psa110.htm#1">Psa 110:1,5</a></ul></dl>
<dt><b><i>118:11 They compassed me about; yea, they compassed me about:<br>but in the name of the LORD I will destroy them.</b></i>
<dt><b><i>118:12 They compassed me about like bees;<br>
they are quenched as the fire of thorns:<br>
for in the name of the LORD I will destroy them. </b></i></dt><dl>
<dt>quenched- The anger of His enemies is easily &quot;extinguished&quot; (ie., put out), like a fire of twigs.
<dd>(or) The enemies themselves are quickly &quot;consumed&quot; (ie., brought to their end), like rapidly burning thorns. (cp. this word in <a href="job6.htm#17">Job 6:17</a>; <a href="job18.htm#5">18:5</a>)
<dd>This will be accomplished at His second coming. <a href="nah1.htm#9">Nah 1:9,10</a>; <a href="zech14.htm#1">Zech 14:1-3</a>; <a href="rev19.htm#19">Rev 19:19-21</a> </dl>
<dt><i><b>118:13 Thou hast thrust sore at me that I might fall: </b></i></dt><dl>
<dt>Satan applied all his resources toward the destruction of the Savior.
<dd>cp. <a href="joh14.htm#30">Joh 14:30</a>; <a href="heb2.htm#14">Heb 2:14</a>; <a href="rev12.htm#1">Rev 12:1-5</a> </dl>
<dt><i><b>but the LORD helped me. </b></i>
<dt><i><b>118:14 The LORD [is] my strength and song, and is become my salvation </b></i>{HB= Yeshua}.</dt><dl><dt>
Here is a great mystery:<dd>How can the LORD (&quot;who is, and was, and evermore shall be&quot;)<i> become </i>anything?
<dd>cp. <a href="ex15.htm#2">Ex 15:2</a>; <a href="isa12.htm#2">Isa 12:2</a>; <a href="isa45.htm#22">Isa 45:22-25</a><br>Yet, to become our salvation, He became a man. &quot;Jesus,&quot; is the GK form of &quot;Yeshua.&quot;<br><a href="mat1.htm#21">Mat 1:21-23</a>; <a href="2cor5.htm#18">2Cor 5:18,19</a>; <a href="1tim3.htm#16">1Tim 3:16</a></dl>
<dt><b><i>118:15 The voice of rejoicing and salvation [is] in the tabernacles of the righteous:<br>
the right hand of the LORD doeth valiantly. </b></i></dt><dl>
<dt>the voice - (in <a href="psa118.htm#15" target="lwr_lt">vs. 15-16</a>) is the sound of believers rejoicing in God's provision of salvation.
<dt>tabernacles - ie., tents. Temporary dwelling places.
<dd>(ie., The fleshly bodies of believers. cp. <a href="2pet1.htm#13">2Pet 1:13,14</a>)
<dt>the right hand of the LORD - This phrase identifies the Lord Jesus Christ.
<dd>cp. <a href="psa110.htm#5">Psa 110:5</a>; <a href="isa51.htm#9">Isa 51:9,10</a>; <a href="mar16.htm#19">Mark 16:19</a>; <a href="act2.htm#32">Acts 2:32-36</a>; <a href="1pet3.htm#22">1Pet 3:22</a>; <a href="rom8.htm#33">Rom 8:33,34</a>; <a href="heb1.htm#3">Heb 1:3</a>
<dt>The picture: The Son of God goes forth to war.
<dd>He engages the battle for the sake of the enemy's captives, who watch from the sidelines.
<dd>The voices of angels and believers narrate His progress, much like the situation which inspired:<blockquote>
<dt>&quot;Oh, say can you see, by the dawn's early light,
<dd>what so proudly we hailed at the twilight's last gleaming...&quot; 
<dt>[excerpt from &quot;The Star Spangle Banner,&quot; national anthem of USA]</blockquote>

<dt><b><i>118:19 Open to me the gates of righteousness:<br>

<dt>This gate- not only has He made the way,<dd>He has<i> become </i>the Way for believers to enter the Father's house, clothed in His righteousness.

<dt><i><b>118:22 The stone [which] the builders refused is become the head [stone] of the corner. </b></i></dt><dl>
<dt>head- HB= roshe, top, chief, total, sum, beginning.

<dt><i><b>118:23 This is the LORD'S doing; it [is] marvellous in our eyes. </b></i></dt><dl>
<dt>Jesus quoted <a href="psa118.htm#22" target="lwr_lt">vs.22-23</a> to the Pharisees, a few days before His crucifixion,
<dd>to warn them that Scripture foretold their rejection of the Messiah.
<dd>He also alluded to other passages, to show the consequences of their rejection.
<dd>Because they stumbled over Him, refusing to see who He is, they would be crushed
<dd>in their attempts to dislodge Him from His rightful place as Head (<a href="psa118.htm#22" target="lwr_lt">v.22</a>).
<dd> <a href="mat21.htm#42">&quot;Mat 21:42-44&quot;</a>; <a href="luk20.htm#17">&quot;Luk 20:17-18&quot;</a>; <a href="isa8.htm#13">Isa 8:13,14</a>; <a href="dan2.htm#34">Dan 2:34,35</a>; <a href="1pet2.htm#4">1Pet 2:4-8</a></dl>
<dt><b><i>118:24 This [is] the day [which] the LORD hath made;<br>
we will rejoice and be glad in it. </b></i></dt><dl>
<dt>What day? As Jesus finished this hymn and departed from the upper room,
<dd>it was early in the morning of His crucifixion day. His hour had come.
<dd>It was the day the Rock of Ages (cp. <a href="psa118.htm#22" target="lwr_lt">v.22</a>) would be cleft, to provide mercy for me.
<dt>&quot;The Day,&quot; to the Jews, signified the Day of Atonement, the holiest day of their year.
<dd>This was not the Day of Atonement on man's calendar (it was Passover), but it was
<dd>the day that the LORD would make atonement for sins, providing Himself as a Lamb.
<dd>On this day, the Anointed One would fulfill one of the purposes of His Anointing.
<dd><a href="isa49.htm#5">Isa 49:5-9</a>; <a href="joh12.htm#27">Joh 12:27,28</a>; <a href="joh17.htm#1">Joh 17:1-5</a></dl>

<dt>The voice of the crowd acclaimed Him. But they desired...<ol type="A">
<li>Political salvation: ie., Freedom from Rome; earthly peace &amp; safety.<br>
They did not recognize the greater significance of this day. <a href="luk19.htm#41">Luk 19:41-44</a><br>They had no comprehension of the peace that He came to give.
<li>Economic salvation: &quot;Send now prosperity.&quot;<br>Instead, their house would be &quot;left... desolate... until...&quot; (<a href="mat23.htm#38">Mat 23:38-39</a>)</ol></dl>

<dt>The people had mouthed these words (<a href="mat21.htm#9">&quot;Mat 21:9&quot;</a>).<dd>But their hearts were not aligned with the LORD and His purposes.<br>Someday, Israel will welcome their Savior and King (<a href="psa110.htm#3">Psa 110:3</a>),<br>and know the blessings of His kingdom, including:

<i><b>118:27 God [is] the LORD, which hath shewed us light: </b></i></dt><dl>
<dt>-- as they trimmed the Temple lamps,<dd>which were fueled with olive oil from the press at Gethsemane,<dd>they remained blind to the Light. <a href="joh8.htm#12">Joh 8:12</a>; <a href="joh12.htm#35">Joh 12:35,36</a></dl>
<dt><i><b>bind the sacrifice with cords, [even] unto the horns of the altar. </b></i></dt><dl>
