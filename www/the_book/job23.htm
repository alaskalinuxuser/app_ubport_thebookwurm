Job  23<br>1. Then Job answered and said,<br><a name="2">2</a>  Even to day [is] my complaint bitter: my stroke is heavier than my groaning.<br><a name="3">3</a>  Oh that I knew where I might find him! [that] I might come [even] to his seat!<br><a name="4">4</a>  I would order [my] cause before him, and fill my mouth with arguments.<br><a name="5">5</a>  I would know the words [which] he would answer me, and understand what he would say unto me.<br><a name="6">6</a>  Will he plead against me with [his] great power? No; but he would put [strength] in me.<br><a name="7">7</a>  There the righteous might dispute with him; so should I be delivered for ever from my judge.<br><a name="8">8</a>. Behold, I go forward, but he [is] not [there]; and backward, but I cannot perceive him:<br><a name="9">9</a>  On the left hand, where he doth work, but I cannot behold [him]: he hideth himself on the right hand, that I cannot see [him]:<br><a name="10">10</a>  But he knoweth the way that I take: [when] he hath tried me, I shall come forth as gold.<br><a name="11">11</a>  My foot hath held his steps, his way have I kept, and not declined.<br><a name="12">12</a>  Neither have I gone back from the commandment of his lips; I have esteemed the words of his mouth more than my necessary [food].<br><a name="13">13</a>. But he [is] in one [mind], and who can turn him? and [what] his soul desireth, even [that] he doeth.<br><a name="14">14</a>  For he performeth [the thing that is] appointed for me: and many such [things are] with him.<br><a name="15">15</a>  Therefore am I troubled at his presence: when I consider, I am afraid of him.<br><a name="16">16</a>  For God maketh my heart soft, and the Almighty troubleth me:<br><a name="17">17</a>  Because I was not cut off before the darkness, [neither] hath he covered the darkness from my face.<br><br>Go to <a href="job24.htm#1">Job 24</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
