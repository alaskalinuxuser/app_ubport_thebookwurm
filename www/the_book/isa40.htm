Isaiah  40<br> 1. Comfort ye, comfort ye my people, saith your God.<br><a name="2">2</a>  Speak ye comfortably to Jerusalem, and cry unto her, that her warfare is accomplished, that her iniquity is pardoned: for she hath received of the LORD'S hand double for all her sins.<br><a name="3">3</a>. The voice of him that crieth in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the LORD, make straight in the desert a highway for our God.<br><a name="4">4</a>  Every valley shall be exalted, and every mountain and hill shall be made low: and the crooked shall be made straight, and the rough places plain:<br><a name="5">5</a>  And the glory of the LORD shall be revealed, and all flesh shall see [it] together: for the mouth of the LORD hath spoken [it].<br><a name="6">6</a>  The voice said, Cry. And he said, What shall I cry? All flesh [is] grass, and all the goodliness thereof [is] as the flower of the field:<br><a name="7">7</a>  The grass withereth, the flower fadeth: because the spirit of the LORD bloweth upon it: surely the people [is] grass.<br><a name="8">8</a>  The grass withereth, the flower fadeth: but the word of our God shall stand for ever.<br><a name="9">9</a>. O Zion, that bringest good tidings, get thee up into the high mountain; O Jerusalem, that bringest good tidings, lift up thy voice with strength; lift [it] up, be not afraid; say unto the cities of Judah, Behold your God!<br><a name="10">10</a>  Behold, the Lord GOD will come with strong [hand], and his arm shall rule for him: behold, his reward [is] with him, and his work before him.<br><a name="11">11</a>  He shall feed his flock like a shepherd: he shall gather the lambs with his arm, and carry [them] in his bosom, [and] shall gently lead those that are with young.<br><a name="12">12</a>. Who hath measured the waters in the hollow of his hand, and meted out heaven with the span, and comprehended the dust of the earth in a measure, and weighed the mountains in scales, and the hills in a balance?<br><a name="13">13</a>  Who hath directed the Spirit of the LORD, or [being] his counsellor hath taught him?<br><a name="14">14</a>  With whom took he counsel, and [who] instructed him, and taught him in the path of judgment, and taught him knowledge, and shewed to him the way of understanding?<br><a name="15">15</a>  Behold, the nations [are] as a drop of a bucket, and are counted as the small dust of the balance: behold, he taketh up the isles as a very little thing.<br><a name="16">16</a>  And Lebanon [is] not sufficient to burn, nor the beasts thereof sufficient for a burnt offering.<br><a name="17">17</a>  All nations before him [are] as nothing; and they are counted to him less than nothing, and vanity.<br><a name="18">18</a>. To whom then will ye liken God? or what likeness will ye compare unto him?<br><a name="19">19</a>  The workman melteth a graven image, and the goldsmith spreadeth it over with gold, and casteth silver chains.<br><a name="20">20</a>  He that [is] so impoverished that he hath no oblation chooseth a tree [that] will not rot; he seeketh unto him a cunning workman to prepare a graven image, [that] shall not be moved.<br><a name="21">21</a>  Have ye not known? have ye not heard? hath it not been told you from the beginning? have ye not understood from the foundations of the earth?<br><a name="22">22</a>  [It is] he that sitteth upon the circle of the earth, and the inhabitants thereof [are] as grasshoppers; that stretcheth out the heavens as a curtain, and spreadeth them out as a tent to dwell in:<br><a name="23">23</a>  That bringeth the princes to nothing; he maketh the judges of the earth as vanity.<br><a name="24">24</a>  Yea, they shall not be planted; yea, they shall not be sown: yea, their stock shall not take root in the earth: and he shall also blow upon them, and they shall wither, and the whirlwind shall take them away as stubble.<br><a name="25">25</a>  To whom then will ye liken me, or shall I be equal? saith the Holy One.<br><a name="26">26</a>  Lift up your eyes on high, and behold who hath created these [things], that bringeth out their host by number: he calleth them all by names by the greatness of his might, for that [he is] strong in power; not one faileth.<br><a name="27">27</a>. Why sayest thou, O Jacob, and speakest, O Israel, My way is hid from the LORD, and my judgment is passed over from my God?<br><a name="28">28</a>  Hast thou not known? hast thou not heard, [that] the everlasting God, the LORD, the Creator of the ends of the earth, fainteth not, neither is weary? [there is] no searching of his understanding.<br><a name="29">29</a>  He giveth power to the faint; and to [them that have] no might he increaseth strength.<br><a name="30">30</a>  Even the youths shall faint and be weary, and the young men shall utterly fall:<br><a name="31">31</a>  But they that wait upon the LORD shall renew [their] strength; they shall mount up with wings as eagles; they shall run, and not be weary; [and] they shall walk, and not faint.<br><br>Go to <a href="isa41.htm#1">Isaiah 41</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
