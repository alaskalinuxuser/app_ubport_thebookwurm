<center>Written by: C.E. Tatham </center>
<center><h4>Introduction</h4></center>
<p>The Apostle Peter told Christians that they should be like newborn babies and always be thirsty for pure spiritual milk, <a href="1pet2.htm#2">1 Peter 2:2</a>. This milk is the Word of God which helps us to grow up as Christians.</p>
<p>For many years, Mr. C. Ernest Tatham has been helping Christians grow. He first prepared these twelve studies as a correspondence course for the Emmaus Bible School. The course was revised to its present form by the editors of Everyday Publications, Inc.</p>
