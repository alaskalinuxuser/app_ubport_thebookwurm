Proverbs  14<br>1. Every wise woman buildeth her house: but the foolish plucketh it down with her hands.<br><a name="2">2</a>. He that walketh in his uprightness feareth the LORD: but [he that is] perverse in his ways despiseth him.<br><a name="3">3</a>. In the mouth of the foolish [is] a rod of pride: but the lips of the wise shall preserve them.<br><a name="4">4</a>. Where no oxen [are], the crib [is] clean: but much increase [is] by the strength of the ox.<br><a name="5">5</a>. A faithful witness will not lie: but a false witness will utter lies.<br><a name="6">6</a>. A scorner seeketh wisdom, and [findeth it] not: but knowledge [is] easy unto him that understandeth.<br><a name="7">7</a>. Go from the presence of a foolish man, when thou perceivest not [in him] the lips of knowledge.<br><a name="8">8</a>. The wisdom of the prudent [is] to understand his way: but the folly of fools [is] deceit.<br><a name="9">9</a>. Fools make a mock at sin: but among the righteous [there is] favour.<br><a name="10">10</a>. The heart knoweth his own bitterness; and a stranger doth not intermeddle with his joy.<br><a name="11">11</a>. The house of the wicked shall be overthrown: but the tabernacle of the upright shall flourish.<br><a name="12">12</a>. There is a way which seemeth right unto a man, but the end thereof [are] the ways of death.<br><a name="13">13</a>. Even in laughter the heart is sorrowful; and the end of that mirth [is] heaviness.<br><a name="14">14</a>. The backslider in heart shall be filled with his own ways: and a good man [shall be satisfied] from himself.<br><a name="15">15</a>. The simple believeth every word: but the prudent [man] looketh well to his going.<br><a name="16">16</a>. A wise [man] feareth, and departeth from evil: but the fool rageth, and is confident.<br><a name="17">17</a>. [He that is] soon angry dealeth foolishly: and a man of wicked devices is hated.<br><a name="18">18</a>. The simple inherit folly: but the prudent are crowned with knowledge.<br><a name="19">19</a>. The evil bow before the good; and the wicked at the gates of the righteous.<br><a name="20">20</a>. The poor is hated even of his own neighbour: but the rich [hath] many friends.<br><a name="21">21</a>. He that despiseth his neighbour sinneth: but he that hath mercy on the poor, happy [is] he.<br><a name="22">22</a>. Do they not err that devise evil? but mercy and truth [shall be] to them that devise good.<br><a name="23">23</a>. In all labour there is profit: but the talk of the lips [tendeth] only to penury.<br><a name="24">24</a>. The crown of the wise [is] their riches: [but] the foolishness of fools [is] folly.<br><a name="25">25</a>. A true witness delivereth souls: but a deceitful [witness] speaketh lies.<br><a name="26">26</a>. In the fear of the LORD [is] strong confidence: and his children shall have a place of refuge.<br><a name="27">27</a>  The fear of the LORD [is] a fountain of life, to depart from the snares of death.<br><a name="28">28</a>. In the multitude of people [is] the king's honour: but in the want of people [is] the destruction of the prince.<br><a name="29">29</a>. [He that is] slow to wrath [is] of great understanding: but [he that is] hasty of spirit exalteth folly.<br><a name="30">30</a>. A sound heart [is] the life of the flesh: but envy the rottenness of the bones.<br><a name="31">31</a>. He that oppresseth the poor reproacheth his Maker: but he that honoureth him hath mercy on the poor.<br><a name="32">32</a>. The wicked is driven away in his wickedness: but the righteous hath hope in his death.<br><a name="33">33</a>. Wisdom resteth in the heart of him that hath understanding: but [that which is] in the midst of fools is made known.<br><a name="34">34</a>. Righteousness exalteth a nation: but sin [is] a reproach to any people.<br><a name="35">35</a>. The king's favour [is] toward a wise servant: but his wrath is [against] him that causeth shame.<br><br>Go to <a href="pro15.htm#1">Proverbs 15</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
