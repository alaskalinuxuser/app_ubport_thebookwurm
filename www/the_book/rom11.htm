Romans  11<br> 1. I say then, Hath God cast away his people? God forbid. For I also am an Israelite, of the seed of Abraham, [of] the tribe of Benjamin.<br><a name="2">2</a>  God hath not cast away his people which he foreknew. Wot ye not what the scripture saith of Elias? how he maketh intercession to God against Israel, saying,<br><a name="3">3</a>  Lord, they have killed thy prophets, and digged down thine altars; and I am left alone, and they seek my life.<br><a name="4">4</a>  But what saith the answer of God unto him? I have reserved to myself seven thousand men, who have not bowed the knee to [the image of] Baal.<br><a name="5">5</a>  Even so then at this present time also there is a remnant according to the election of grace.<br><a name="6">6</a>  And if by grace, then [is it] no more of works: otherwise grace is no more grace. But if [it be] of works, then is it no more grace: otherwise work is no more work.<br><a name="7">7</a>  What then? Israel hath not obtained that which he seeketh for; but the election hath obtained it, and the rest were blinded<br><a name="8">8</a>  (According as it is written, God hath given them the spirit of slumber, eyes that they should not see, and ears that they should not hear;) unto this day.<br><a name="9">9</a>  And David saith, Let their table be made a snare, and a trap, and a stumblingblock, and a recompence unto them:<br><a name="10">10</a>  Let their eyes be darkened, that they may not see, and bow down their back alway.<br><a name="11">11</a>  I say then, Have they stumbled that they should fall? God forbid: but [rather] through their fall salvation [is come] unto the Gentiles, for to provoke them to jealousy.<br><a name="12">12</a>  Now if the fall of them [be] the riches of the world, and the diminishing of them the riches of the Gentiles; how much more their fulness?<br><a name="13">13</a>  For I speak to you Gentiles, inasmuch as I am the apostle of the Gentiles, I magnify mine office:<br><a name="14">14</a>  If by any means I may provoke to emulation [them which are] my flesh, and might save some of them.<br><a name="15">15</a>  For if the casting away of them [be] the reconciling of the world, what [shall] the receiving [of them be], but life from the dead?<br><a name="16">16</a>  For if the firstfruit [be] holy, the lump [is] also [holy]: and if the root [be] holy, so [are] the branches.<br><a name="17">17</a>  And if some of the branches be broken off, and thou, being a wild olive tree, wert graffed in among them, and with them partakest of the root and fatness of the olive tree;<br><a name="18">18</a>  Boast not against the branches. But if thou boast, thou bearest not the root, but the root thee.<br><a name="19">19</a>  Thou wilt say then, The branches were broken off, that I might be graffed in.<br><a name="20">20</a>  Well; because of unbelief they were broken off, and thou standest by faith. Be not highminded, but fear:<br><a name="21">21</a>  For if God spared not the natural branches, [take heed] lest he also spare not thee.<br><a name="22">22</a>  Behold therefore the goodness and severity of God: on them which fell, severity; but toward thee, goodness, if thou continue in [his] goodness: otherwise thou also shalt be cut off.<br><a name="23">23</a>  And they also, if they abide not still in unbelief, shall be graffed in: for God is able to graff them in again.<br><a name="24">24</a>  For if thou wert cut out of the olive tree which is wild by nature, and wert graffed contrary to nature into a good olive tree: how much more shall these, which be the natural [branches], be graffed into their own olive tree?<br><a name="25">25</a>  For I would not, brethren, that ye should be ignorant of this mystery, lest ye should be wise in your own conceits; that blindness in part is happened to Israel, until the fulness of the Gentiles be come in.<br><a name="26">26</a>  And so all Israel shall be saved: as it is written, There shall come out of Sion the Deliverer, and shall turn away ungodliness from Jacob:<br><a name="27">27</a>  For this [is] my covenant unto them, when I shall take away their sins.<br><a name="28">28</a>  As concerning the gospel, [they are] enemies for your sakes: but as touching the election, [they are] beloved for the fathers' sakes.<br><a name="29">29</a>  For the gifts and calling of God [are] without repentance.<br><a name="30">30</a>  For as ye in times past have not believed God, yet have now obtained mercy through their unbelief:<br><a name="31">31</a>  Even so have these also now not believed, that through your mercy they also may obtain mercy.<br><a name="32">32</a>  For God hath concluded them all in unbelief, that he might have mercy upon all.<br><a name="33">33</a>. O the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God! how unsearchable [are] his judgments, and his ways past finding out!<br><a name="34">34</a>  For who hath known the mind of the Lord? or who hath been his counsellor?<br><a name="35">35</a>  Or who hath first given to him, and it shall be recompensed unto him again?<br><a name="36">36</a>  For of him, and through him, and to him, [are] all things: to whom [be] glory for ever.
