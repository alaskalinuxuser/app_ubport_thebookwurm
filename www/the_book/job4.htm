Job   4<br>1. Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered and said,<br><a name="2">2</a>  [If] we assay to commune with thee, wilt thou be grieved? but who can withhold himself from speaking?<br><a name="3">3</a>  Behold, thou hast instructed many, and thou hast strengthened the weak hands.<br><a name="4">4</a>  Thy words have upholden him that was falling, and thou hast strengthened the feeble knees.<br><a name="5">5</a>  But now it is come upon thee, and thou faintest; it toucheth thee, and thou art troubled.<br><a name="6">6</a>  [Is] not [this] thy fear, thy confidence, thy hope, and the uprightness of thy ways?<br><a name="7">7</a>. Remember, I pray thee, who [ever] perished, being innocent? or where were the righteous cut off?<br><a name="8">8</a>  Even as I have seen, they that plow iniquity, and sow wickedness, reap the same.<br><a name="9">9</a>  By the blast of God they perish, and by the breath of his nostrils are they consumed.<br><a name="10">10</a>  The roaring of the lion, and the voice of the fierce lion, and the teeth of the young lions, are broken.<br><a name="11">11</a>  The old lion perisheth for lack of prey, and the stout lion's whelps are scattered abroad.<br><a name="12">12</a>. Now a thing was secretly brought to me, and mine ear received a little thereof.<br><a name="13">13</a>  In thoughts from the visions of the night, when deep sleep falleth on men,<br><a name="14">14</a>  Fear came upon me, and trembling, which made all my bones to shake.<br><a name="15">15</a>  Then a spirit passed before my face; the hair of my flesh stood up:<br><a name="16">16</a>  It stood still, but I could not discern the form thereof: an image [was] before mine eyes, [there was] silence, and I heard a voice, [saying],<br><a name="17">17</a>  Shall mortal man be more just than God? shall a man be more pure than his maker?<br><a name="18">18</a>  Behold, he put no trust in his servants; and his angels he charged with folly:<br><a name="19">19</a>  How much less [in] them that dwell in houses of clay, whose foundation [is] in the dust, [which] are crushed before the moth?<br><a name="20">20</a>  They are destroyed from morning to evening: they perish for ever without any regarding [it].<br><a name="21">21</a>  Doth not their excellency [which is] in them go away? they die, even without wisdom.<br><br>Go to <a href="job5.htm#1">Job 5</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
