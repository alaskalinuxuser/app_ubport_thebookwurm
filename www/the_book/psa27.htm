Psalms  27<br> 1. [A Psalm] of David. The LORD [is] my light and my salvation; whom shall I fear? the LORD [is] the strength of my life; of whom shall I be afraid?<br><a name="2">2</a>  When the wicked, [even] mine enemies and my foes, came upon me to eat up my flesh, they stumbled and fell.<br><a name="3">3</a>  Though an host should encamp against me, my heart shall not fear: though war should rise against me, in this [will] I [be] confident.<br><a name="4">4</a>  One [thing] have I desired of the LORD, that will I seek after; that I may dwell in the house of the LORD all the days of my life, to behold the beauty of the LORD, and to enquire in his temple.<br><a name="5">5</a>  For in the time of trouble he shall hide me in his pavilion: in the secret of his tabernacle shall he hide me; he shall set me up upon a rock.<br><a name="6">6</a>  And now shall mine head be lifted up above mine enemies round about me: therefore will I offer in his tabernacle sacrifices of joy; I will sing, yea, I will sing praises unto the LORD.<br><a name="7">7</a>. Hear, O LORD, [when] I cry with my voice: have mercy also upon me, and answer me.<br><a name="8">8</a>  [When thou saidst], Seek ye my face; my heart said unto thee, Thy face, LORD, will I seek.<br><a name="9">9</a>  Hide not thy face [far] from me; put not thy servant away in anger: thou hast been my help; leave me not, neither forsake me, O God of my salvation.<br><a name="10">10</a>  When my father and my mother forsake me, then the LORD will take me up.<br><a name="11">11</a>  Teach me thy way, O LORD, and lead me in a plain path, because of mine enemies.<br><a name="12">12</a>  Deliver me not over unto the will of mine enemies: for false witnesses are risen up against me, and such as breathe out cruelty.<br><a name="13">13</a>  [I had fainted], unless I had believed to see the goodness of the LORD in the land of the living.<br><a name="14">14</a>  Wait on the LORD: be of good courage, and he shall strengthen thine heart: wait, I say, on the LORD.<br><br>Go to <a href="psa28.htm#1">Psalm 28</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
