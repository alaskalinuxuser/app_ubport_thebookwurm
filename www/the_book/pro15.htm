Proverbs  15<br>1. A soft answer turneth away wrath: but grievous words stir up anger.<br><a name="2">2</a>. The tongue of the wise useth knowledge aright: but the mouth of fools poureth out foolishness.<br><a name="3">3</a>. The eyes of the LORD [are] in every place, beholding the evil and the good.<br><a name="4">4</a>. A wholesome tongue [is] a tree of life: but perverseness therein [is] a breach in the spirit.<br><a name="5">5</a>. A fool despiseth his father's instruction: but he that regardeth reproof is prudent.<br><a name="6">6</a>. In the house of the righteous [is] much treasure: but in the revenues of the wicked is trouble.<br><a name="7">7</a>. The lips of the wise disperse knowledge: but the heart of the foolish [doeth] not so.<br><a name="8">8</a>. The sacrifice of the wicked [is] an abomination to the LORD: but the prayer of the upright [is] his delight.<br><a name="9">9</a>. The way of the wicked [is] an abomination unto the LORD: but he loveth him that followeth after righteousness.<br><a name="10">10</a>. Correction [is] grievous unto him that forsaketh the way: [and] he that hateth reproof shall die.<br><a name="11">11</a>. Hell and destruction [are] before the LORD: how much more then the hearts of the children of men?<br><a name="12">12</a>. A scorner loveth not one that reproveth him: neither will he go unto the wise.<br><a name="13">13</a>. A merry heart maketh a cheerful countenance: but by sorrow of the heart the spirit is broken.<br><a name="14">14</a>. The heart of him that hath understanding seeketh knowledge: but the mouth of fools feedeth on foolishness.<br><a name="15">15</a>. All the days of the afflicted [are] evil: but he that is of a merry heart [hath] a continual feast.<br><a name="16">16</a>. Better [is] little with the fear of the LORD than great treasure and trouble therewith.<br><a name="17">17</a>  Better [is] a dinner of herbs where love is, than a stalled ox and hatred therewith.<br><a name="18">18</a>. A wrathful man stirreth up strife: but [he that is] slow to anger appeaseth strife.<br><a name="19">19</a>. The way of the slothful [man is] as an hedge of thorns: but the way of the righteous [is] made plain.<br><a name="20">20</a>. A wise son maketh a glad father: but a foolish man despiseth his mother.<br><a name="21">21</a>. Folly [is] joy to [him that is] destitute of wisdom: but a man of understanding walketh uprightly.<br><a name="22">22</a>. Without counsel purposes are disappointed: but in the multitude of counsellors they are established.<br><a name="23">23</a>. A man hath joy by the answer of his mouth: and a word [spoken] in due season, how good [is it]!<br><a name="24">24</a>. The way of life [is] above to the wise, that he may depart from hell beneath.<br><a name="25">25</a>. The LORD will destroy the house of the proud: but he will establish the border of the widow.<br><a name="26">26</a>. The thoughts of the wicked [are] an abomination to the LORD: but [the words] of the pure [are] pleasant words.<br><a name="27">27</a>. He that is greedy of gain troubleth his own house; but he that hateth gifts shall live.<br><a name="28">28</a>. The heart of the righteous studieth to answer: but the mouth of the wicked poureth out evil things.<br><a name="29">29</a>. The LORD [is] far from the wicked: but he heareth the prayer of the righteous.<br><a name="30">30</a>. The light of the eyes rejoiceth the heart: [and] a good report maketh the bones fat.<br><a name="31">31</a>. The ear that heareth the reproof of life abideth among the wise.<br><a name="32">32</a>. He that refuseth instruction despiseth his own soul: but he that heareth reproof getteth understanding.<br><a name="33">33</a>. The fear of the LORD [is] the instruction of wisdom; and before honour [is] humility.<br><br>Go to <a href="pro16.htm#1">Proverbs 16</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
