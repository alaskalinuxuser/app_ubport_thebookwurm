Hosea  14<br>1. O Israel, return unto the LORD thy God; for thou hast fallen by thine iniquity.<br><a name="2">2</a>  Take with you words, and turn to the LORD: say unto him, Take away all iniquity, and receive [us] graciously: so will we render the calves of our lips.<br><a name="3">3</a>  Asshur shall not save us; we will not ride upon horses: neither will we say any more to the work of our hands, [Ye are] our gods: for in thee the fatherless findeth mercy.<br><a name="4">4</a>. I will heal their backsliding, I will love them freely: for mine anger is turned away from him.<br><a name="5">5</a>  I will be as the dew unto Israel: he shall grow as the lily, and cast forth his roots as Lebanon.<br><a name="6">6</a>  His branches shall spread, and his beauty shall be as the olive tree, and his smell as Lebanon.<br><a name="7">7</a>  They that dwell under his shadow shall return; they shall revive [as] the corn, and grow as the vine: the scent thereof [shall be] as the wine of Lebanon.<br><a name="8">8</a>. Ephraim [shall say], What have I to do any more with idols? I have heard [him], and observed him: I [am] like a green fir tree. From me is thy fruit found.<br><a name="9">9</a>  Who [is] wise, and he shall understand these [things]? prudent, and he shall know them? for the ways of the LORD [are] right, and the just shall walk in them: but the transgressors shall fall therein.<br><br>End of Hosea.<br>Go to <a href="joel1.htm#1">Joel 1</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
