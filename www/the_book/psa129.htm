Let them all be confounded and turned back that hate Zion.<br><a name="6">6</a>  Let them be as the grass [upon] the housetops, which withereth afore it groweth up:<br><a name="7">7</a>  Wherewith the mower filleth not his hand; nor he that bindeth sheaves his bosom.<br><a name="8">8</a>  Neither do they which go by say, The blessing of the LORD [be] upon you: we bless you in the name of the LORD.<br><br>Go to <a href="psa130.htm#1">Psalm 130</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
