1Thessalonians   4<br> 1. Furthermore then we beseech you, brethren, and exhort [you] by the Lord Jesus, that as ye have received of us how ye ought to walk and to please God, [so] ye would abound more and more.<br><a name="2">2</a>  For ye know what commandments we gave you by the Lord Jesus.<br><a name="3">3</a>  For this is the will of God, [even] your sanctification, that ye should abstain from fornication:<br><a name="4">4</a>  That every one of you should know how to possess his vessel in sanctification and honour;<br><a name="5">5</a>  Not in the lust of concupiscence, even as the Gentiles which know not God:<br><a name="6">6</a>  That no [man] go beyond and defraud his brother in [any] matter: because that the Lord [is] the avenger of all such, as we also have forewarned you and testified.<br><a name="7">7</a>  For God hath not called us unto uncleanness, but unto holiness.<br><a name="8">8</a>  He therefore that despiseth, despiseth not man, but God, who hath also given unto us his holy Spirit.<br><a name="9">9</a>. But as touching brotherly love ye need not that I write unto you: for ye yourselves are taught of God to love one another.<br><a name="10">10</a>  And indeed ye do it toward all the brethren which are in all Macedonia: but we beseech you, brethren, that ye increase more and more;<br><a name="11">11</a>  And that ye study to be quiet, and to do your own business, and to work with your own hands, as we commanded you;<br><a name="12">12</a>  That ye may walk honestly toward them that are without, and [that] ye may have lack of nothing.<br><a name="13">13</a>. But I would not have you to be ignorant, brethren, concerning them which are asleep, that ye sorrow not, even as others which have no hope.<br><a name="14">14</a>  For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so them also which sleep in Jesus will God bring with him.<br><a name="15">15</a>  For this we say unto you by the word of the Lord, that we which are alive [and] remain unto the coming of the Lord shall not prevent them which are asleep.<br><a name="16">16</a>  For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God: and the dead in Christ shall rise first:<br><a name="17">17</a>  Then we which are alive [and] remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air: and so shall we ever be with the Lord.<br><a name="18">18</a>  Wherefore comfort one another with these words.<br><br>Go to <a href="1the5.htm#1">I Thessalonians 5</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
