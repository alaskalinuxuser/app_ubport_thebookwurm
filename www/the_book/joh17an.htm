<dl><dt>
<i><b>17:1. These words spake Jesus, and lifted up his eyes to heaven, and said,<br>
Father, the hour is come; </b></i></dt><dl>
<dt>Chapter 17 consists entirely of the longest recorded prayer of Jesus. 
<dd>This is the Lord's <b>High Priestly Prayer</b>.
<dd>It is quite different from the prayer referred to as 'the Lord's Prayer' (<a href="mat6.htm#9">Mat 6:9-13</a>), <ul>
<li>which was intended as a pattern or example to teach the disciples how to pray (<a href="luk11.htm#1">Luk 11:1-4</a>).
<li>which contained aspects which could not apply to Him (eg., <a href="mat6.htm#12">Mat 6:12</a>).</ul>
<dt>Here, Jesus prays as no one else could pray...<dd><ol type="A">
<li>with direct intimacy, based on His eternal fellowship with the Father.<br>
&quot;Father...&quot; - He approaches directly, with no special preparation, no confession of sin, no hint that the One addressed is other than He is. (contrast <a href="mat6.htm#9">Mat 6:9,10,12</a>)
<li>as our High Priest, based on His completed sacrifice.<br>
&quot;the hour is come...&quot; cp. <a href="joh2.htm#4">2:4</a>; <a href="joh7.htm#30">7:30</a>; <a href="joh8.htm#20">8:20</a>; <a href="joh12.htm#23">12:23</a>; <a href="joh13.htm#1">13:1</a><ul>
<li>He speaks of His sacrificial death as already accomplished,<br>though it is yet several hours away.<br>
<li>He speaks as the Lamb, slain from the foundation of the world (<a href="rev5.htm#6">Rev 5:6</a>; <a href="rev13.htm#8">13:8</a>), who was about to finish the work which the Father had given Him to do (<a href="joh17.htm#4" target="lwr_lt">v.4</a>; cp. <a href="joh4.htm#34">4:34</a>; <a href="joh19.htm#30">19:30</a>).<br>
<li>He communes with the Father regarding things previously discussed in the counsels of God.</ul></ol>
<dt><i>Who He is </i>and<i> what He has done </i>form the basis of His approach to the Father,<dd>and also the basis of our salvation, and access into the Father's presence (cp. <a href="joh16.htm#26">16:26-27</a>).
<dt>This prayer is truly Holy ground.-
<dd>When the LORD appeared in the burning bush, He warned Moses concerning his approach to holy ground (<a href="ex3.htm#4">Ex 3:4,5</a>). On that occasion, the LORD intended to speak with a man. But here, we draw near to overhear the intimate communication between God the Son and God the Father. What a privilege He has afforded us. How inadequate we are to comprehend what is said here. The editor is acutely aware of his own insufficiencies. Any human attempts to explain (like Moses' tools) may detract from the holy substance before us (eg., <a href="ex20.htm#25">Ex 20:25</a>). Therefore, please take time to prayerfully read through the full text of <a href="joh17.htm#1" target="lwr_lt">John ch. 17</a>, before considering the notes below.
<dt><dt>He makes <b>Seven Requests</b>- 
<dd>-- Two for Himself (<a href="joh17.htm#1" target="lwr_lt">v.1</a>, <a href="joh17.htm#5" target="lwr_lt">v.5</a>), <dd>-- Five for His own (<a href="joh17.htm#11" target="lwr_lt">v.11</a>, <a href="joh17.htm#15" target="lwr_lt">v.15</a>, <a href="joh17.htm#17" target="lwr_lt">v.17</a>, <a href="joh17.htm#21" target="lwr_lt">v.21</a>, <a href="joh17.htm#24" target="lwr_lt">v.24</a>)

that he should give eternal life to as many as thou hast given him.<br>

<dt>glorify- GK=doxazo, honor, magnify. <dd>The word 'primarily denotes &quot;to suppose&quot; (from <i>doxa</i>, &quot;an opinion&quot;; and <i>dokeo</i>, &quot;to seem&quot;).' [WEVine]<br>Not all who are honored are what they seem.<ul>
<li>As used of God, it speaks of His Self-revelation of His character,<br>
and of the work of specific Persons of the Godhead to make the other Persons known.  cp. <a href="joh11.htm#4">11:4</a>; <a href="joh12.htm#28">12:28</a>; <a href="joh13.htm#31">13:31</a>; <a href="joh16.htm#14">16:14</a>
<li>In this context, the effect of this word is: &quot;to make Him known for who He is.&quot;<br>
ie., 'Father... make your Son known for who He is, that He may make You known for who You are.'</ul>
<dt>glorify... that thy Son may glorify thee- 
<dd>He prays, in dependence upon the Father's provision. <a href="joh5.htm#19">5:19,20</a>
<dt>glorify... as thou hast <i>given</i>... that He should <i>give</i>... to as many as thou hast <i>given</i>...-

<dd>Jesus glorified the Father through His life of complete obedience. He held nothing back for Himself, but poured Himself out for the Father's glory (<a href="isa50.htm#4">Isa 50:4-6</a>; <a href="isa53.htm#12">Isa 53:12</a>). In doing these things, He brought many sons into glory (<a href="heb2.htm#9">Heb 2:9,10</a>), and He revealed to all creation the glorious character and purposes of God (<a href="rev5.htm#9">Rev 5:9-14</a>).</dl>
<dt><b>- Request #2 -</b><dt>
<i><b>17:5  And now, O Father, glorify thou me with thine own self<br>
with the glory which I had with thee before the world was.</b></i></dt><dl>
<dt>glorify... with thine own self...- As the Son would glorify the Father with His own self, on His cross,
<dd>so, the Father would glorify the Son with His own self, on His throne. cp. <a href="act2.htm#33">Acts 2:33</a>; <a href="heb12.htm#2">Heb 12:2</a>
<dt>...with the glory which I had with thee before...-
<dd>When He came into the world, God the Son laid aside many aspects of His glory.-<ul><li>He became a man (limited by time and space). <li>He became a servant (not exercising His power &amp; authority). <li>He came to die. <li>Yet, as a man, He was still fully God.<br>&quot;He was still King of the Universe- but He laid aside His robes and crown, so the poorest of us could know Him.&quot; [McGee]<br>Now, He asks to be restored to the fullness of His former glory as God.

<dt>Even during His earthly ministry, the things pertaining to the Father belonged to the Son:

From eternity past, God knew who would be saved (<a href="eph1.htm#3">Eph 1:3,4</a>). Christ died for the sins of the whole world, but not everyone will benefit. Those, who are His, respond to the Gospel preached to every creature (<a href="joh6.htm#37">6:37</a>). They are 'whosoever believes' (<a href="joh3.htm#16">3:16</a>), and 'as many as receive Him' (<a href="joh1.htm#12">1:12</a>).<br>
These men are set apart from the world, in that they...<ul><li>have kept (obeyed, <a href="joh17.htm#6" target="lwr_lt">v.6</a>) and received (<a href="joh17.htm#8" target="lwr_lt">v.8</a>) God's Word, <li>have known and believed the Truth concerning God's Son and the mission on which He was sent into the world (<a href="joh17.htm#8" target="lwr_lt">v.8</a>).</ul>

<dt>This oneness is <b>not</b>-  union with all who 'profess' to be Christians. 
<dd>- - If all denominations were to join in one great church organization, it could not fulfill Jesus' prayer for oneness, because every denomination contains a mixture of true believers and mere professors. Although the percentage of believers varies from group to group, the visible church (the earthly organization of religious people) does not consist entirely of those who are born of God's Spirit...
<dd>- - The 'wheat and tares' can never be 'one,' though they grow intermingled in the same field (<a href="mat13.htm#24">Mat 13:24-30</a>), because they are essentially different in nature. Those who have a nature acceptable to the Father (the wheat), have such a nature only through faith in Christ. He has placed His Life ('the glory') within them.  <a href="joh1.htm#11">1:11-14,16</a>; <a href="joh3.htm#3">3:3,5-7</a>; <a href="joh14.htm#6">14:6</a>; <a href="joh15.htm#5">15:5</a>

<dt>In one sense, Jesus' prayer has already been answered by the Father. 
<dd>The Holy Spirit has united all true believers into Christ's Body, the true (invisible) Church. <a href="1cor12.htm#13">1Cor 12:13</a>; <a href="eph4.htm#4">Eph 4:4-6</a>
<dt>In another sense, Jesus' prayer addresses an ever present need in the true Church.<ul>
<li>Although true believers are joined to Christ and to one another in Christ's Body, it is possible for fleshly divisions to break our fellowship in the furtherance of the Gospel. Members of Christ's Body are enabled to love one another and participate together in His work, as they abide in Christ and His Word, and yield to His Spirit. <a href="joh13.htm#35">Joh 13:35</a>; <a href="eph4.htm#3">Eph 4:3</a>; <a href="php2.htm#1">Php 2:1-5</a>; <a href="col3.htm#8">Col 3:8-15</a>; <a href="jam3.htm#14">Jam 3:14-18</a> (note the order: &quot;...<i>first</i> pure, <i>then</i> peaceable...&quot;)
<li>Oneness with Him should govern our relationships with other believers.-<br>

<dt><b>- Request #7 -</b><dt>
<i><b>17:24  Father, I will that they also, whom thou hast given me, be with me where I am;<dt>&nbsp;
<dt>that they may behold my glory, which thou hast given me:<br>
for thou lovedst me before the foundation of the world.<br>
17:25  O righteous Father, the world hath not known thee:<br>
but I have known thee, and these have known that thou hast sent me.<br>
17:26  And I have declared unto them thy name, and will declare [it]:<br>
that the love wherewith thou hast loved me may be in them, and I in them.</b></i></dt><dl>
<dt>I will that they... be with me where I am... - His request encompasses...<dd><ol type="a">
<li>our future bodily presence with Him.- cp. <a href="joh14.htm#3">14:3</a>; <a href="col3.htm#4">Col 3:4</a>; <a href="1the4.htm#17">1The 4:17</a><dd>&quot;The love that desired reunion with the Father in glory (<a href="joh17.htm#1" target="lwr_lt">v.1</a> and <a href="joh17.htm#5" target="lwr_lt">v.5</a>) equally desired the fellowship of His loved disciples in glory (<a href="joh17.htm#24" target="lwr_lt">v.24</a>), and His entrance into that glory after having finished the work of their redemption (<a href="joh17.htm#4" target="lwr_lt">v.4</a>), guaranteed their presence there (<a href="joh17.htm#2" target="lwr_lt">v.2</a>). His being there was their title to be there.&quot; [GWms]</dd>
<li>our present spiritual presence with Him.- cp. <a href="eph1.htm#3">Eph 1:3,20</a>; <a href="eph2.htm#6">2:6</a></ol>
<dt>for thou lovedst me before the foundation of the world.- cp. <a href="joh17.htm#5" target="lwr_lt">v.5</a>
<dd>His equality with the Father forms...<ul>
<li>the basis of His prayer {&quot;I will...&quot;, <a href="joh17.htm#24" target="lwr_lt">v.24</a>}, and
<li>the necessity for our knowledge of Him (&quot;that they may behold my glory...&quot;)<br>
- - He wants us to be near Him, so that we might know Him better (cp. <a href="joh17.htm#3" target="lwr_lt">v.3</a>).</ul>
<dt>I have known thee... these have known that thou hast sent me.-
<dd>Note the great gulf between the knowledge which Jesus has of the Father (<a href="joh7.htm#29">7:29</a>; <a href="joh10.htm#15">10:15</a>)<br>
and the knowledge that the disciples had of Him (<a href="joh17.htm#8" target="lwr_lt">v.8</a>; <a href="joh16.htm#27">16:27</a>).<br>Through their limited knowledge of, and faith in, Him... they were given access to a growing knowledge of Him.
<dt>I have declared {ie., 'made known'}... thy name {<a href="joh17.htm#6" target="lwr_lt">v.6</a>}, and will declare it {cp. <a href="psa22.htm#22">Psa 22:22</a>; <a href="heb2.htm#12">Heb 2:12</a>}-
<dd>Christ will make the character and purposes of the Father known...<ul>
<li>through the Church - <dd>The world, which has 'not known' Him due to unbelief (<a href="joh17.htm#25" target="lwr_lt">v.25</a>), and 
which is, therefore, excluded from Christ's presence (<a href="joh17.htm#24" target="lwr_lt">v.24</a>), will eventually acknowledge the wisdom and righteousness of God (cp. <a href="joh17.htm#23" target="lwr_lt">v.23</a>; <a href="joh17.htm#25" target="lwr_lt">v.25</a>) for His judgment of sin and for His justification of believers. cp. <a href="eph3.htm#10">Eph 3:10</a>; <a href="php2.htm#10">Php 2:10,11</a></dd>
<li>to the Church -<ol type="a">
<li>'that they may be indwelt by the love<br><i>which the Father has for the Son.</i>' <a href="joh17.htm#26" target="lwr_lt">v.26</a> (cp. <a href="joh17.htm#24" target="lwr_lt">v.24</a>); cp. <a href="1pet1.htm#8">1Pet 1:8</a>; <a href="1joh5.htm#1">1Joh 5:1,2</a>
<li>that they may be indwelt by Christ Himself. cp. <a href="joh15.htm#4">15:4</a>; <a href="eph3.htm#13">Eph 3:13-21</a>; <a href="eph4.htm#13">4:13</a>; <a href="col1.htm#27">Col 1:27</a></ol></ul>
<dt>Thus, our Great High Priest earnestly prays... 
<dd>seeking only to glorify the Father, and to bring many sons unto glory (<a href="heb2.htm#10">Heb 2:10</a>).
<dd>His prayer does not close with the word 'Amen' ('so be it'). For He Himself is the 'Amen' (<a href="2cor1.htm#20">2Cor 1:20</a>).
<dd>For these things to be, He must offer His all sufficient sacrifice. The hour has come.
