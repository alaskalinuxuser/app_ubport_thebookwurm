<dt><b><i>9:1 Then the LORD said unto Moses, Go in unto Pharaoh, and tell him,<br>Thus saith the LORD God of the Hebrews, Let my people go, that they may serve me.<br>
9:2 For if thou refuse to let [them] go, and wilt hold them still,<br>
9:3 Behold, the hand of the LORD is upon thy cattle which [is] in the field,<br>upon the horses, upon the asses, upon the camels, upon the oxen, and upon the sheep:<br>[there shall be] a very grievous murrain </b></i>{ie., pestilence, disease}<i><b>.<br>
9:4 And the LORD shall sever between the cattle of Israel and the cattle of Egypt:<br>and there shall nothing die of all [that is] the children's of Israel.<br>
9:5 And the LORD appointed a set time, saying,<br>To morrow the LORD shall do this thing in the land.<br>
9:6 And the LORD did that thing on the morrow, and all the cattle of Egypt died:<br>but of the cattle of the children of Israel died not one.<br>
9:7 And Pharaoh sent, and, behold, there was not one of the cattle of the Israelites dead.<br>And the heart of Pharaoh was hardened </b></i>{HB=kabed, honored}<i><b>,<br>and he did not let the people go.</i></b></dt><dl>
<dt>Plague #5 - Disease upon Livestock<ul>
<li><i>False gods judged</i> -<ul><li>Apis, the bull god.<dd>The large temple to Apis housed the reigning god (a live bull), and contained the mummies of his predecessors.</dd><li>Hathor, the cowheaded goddess.</ul>
<li><i>Magicians' response</i> - (silence)
<li><i>Pharaoh's response</i> - <ol type="a">
<li>he sent to see whether Israel's cattle were affected.<dd>Their exemption was a strong indication that this was a judgment from the Lord.</dd>
<li>his heart was hardened, he did not let the people go.</ol></ul></dl><dt>
<b><i>9:8 And the LORD said unto Moses and unto Aaron,<br>Take to you handfuls of ashes of the furnace,<br>and let Moses sprinkle it toward the heaven in the sight of Pharaoh.<br>
9:9 And it shall become small dust in all the land of Egypt, and shall be a boil breaking forth<br>[with] blains </b></i>{blisters, ulcers} <i><b>upon man, and upon beast, throughout all the land of Egypt.<br>
9:10 And they took ashes of the furnace, and stood before Pharaoh;<br>and Moses sprinkled it up toward heaven;<br>and it became a boil breaking forth [with] blains upon man, and upon beast.<br>
9:11 And the magicians could not stand before Moses because of the boils;<br>for the boil was upon the magicians, and upon all the Egyptians.<br>
9:12 And the LORD hardened </b></i>{HB=chazaq, strengthened}<i><b> the heart of Pharaoh,<br>and he hearkened not unto them; as the LORD had spoken unto Moses.</i></b></dt><dl>
<dt>Plague #6 - Boils upon men -<ul>
<li><i>False gods judged</i> - Sekhmet, a goddess with power over disease.
<li><i>Magicians' response</i> - They, themselves being afflicted with boils,<dd>could not stand in their appointed places as priests to Pharaoh.</dd><dd>To exercise their duties, all priests were required to be without spot or blemish.</dd>
<li><i>Pharaoh's response</i> - his heart was hardened, he hearkened not unto them.</ul></dl><dt>
<b><i>9:13 And the LORD said unto Moses, Rise up early in the morning, and stand before Pharaoh,<br>and say unto him, Thus saith the LORD God of the Hebrews,<br>Let my people go, that they may serve me.<br>
9:14 For I will at this time send all my plagues upon thine heart,<br>and upon thy servants, and upon thy people;<br>that thou mayest know that [there is] none like me in all the earth.<br>
9:15 For now I will stretch out my hand, that I may smite thee and thy people with pestilence;<br>and thou shalt be cut off from the earth.<br>
9:16 And in very deed for this [cause] have I raised thee up, for to shew [in] thee my power;<br>and that my name may be declared throughout all the earth.<br>
9:17 As yet exaltest thou thyself against my people, that thou wilt not let them go?<br>
9:18 Behold, to morrow about this time I will cause it to rain a very grievous hail,<br>such as hath not been in Egypt since the foundation thereof even until now.<br>
9:19 Send therefore now, [and] gather thy cattle, and all that thou hast in the field;<br>[for upon] every man and beast which shall be found in the field, and shall not be brought home,<br>the hail shall come down upon them, and they shall die.<br>
9:20 He that feared the word of the LORD among the servants of Pharaoh<br>made his servants and his cattle flee into the houses:<br>
9:21 And he that regarded not the word of the LORD left his servants and his cattle in the field.<br>
9:22 And the LORD said unto Moses,<br>Stretch forth thine hand toward heaven, that there may be hail in all the land of Egypt,<br>upon man, and upon beast, and upon every herb of the field, throughout the land of Egypt.<br>
9:23 And Moses stretched forth his rod toward heaven:<br>and the LORD sent thunder and hail, and the fire ran along upon the ground;<br>and the LORD rained hail upon the land of Egypt.<br>
9:24 So there was hail, and fire mingled with the hail,<br>very grievous, such as there was none like it in all the land of Egypt since it became a nation.<br>
9:25 And the hail smote throughout all the land of Egypt<br>all that [was] in the field, both man and beast;<br>and the hail smote every herb of the field, and brake every tree of the field.<br>
9:26 Only in the land of Goshen, where the children of Israel [were], was there no hail.<br>
9:27 And Pharaoh sent, and called for Moses and Aaron, and said unto them,<br>I have sinned this time: the LORD [is] righteous, and I and my people [are] wicked.<br>
9:28 Intreat the LORD (for [it is] enough) that there be no [more] mighty thunderings and hail;<br>and I will let you go, and ye shall stay no longer.<br>
9:29 And Moses said unto him,<br>As soon as I am gone out of the city, I will spread abroad my hands unto the LORD;<br>[and] the thunder shall cease, neither shall there be any more hail;<br>that thou mayest know how that the earth [is] the LORD'S.<br>
9:30 But as for thee and thy servants, I know that ye will not yet fear the LORD God. </b></i>{cp. <a href="isa26.htm#10">Isa 26:10</a>}<i><b><br>
9:31 And the flax and the barley was smitten:<br>for the barley [was] in the ear, and the flax [was] bolled  </b></i>{ie., budded}<i><b>.<br>
9:32 But the wheat and the rie were not smitten: for they [were] not grown up </b></i>{HB=aphiyl, late, ripe}<i><b>.<br>
9:33 And Moses went out of the city from Pharaoh, and spread abroad his hands unto the LORD:<br>and the thunders and hail ceased, and the rain was not poured upon the earth.<br>
9:34 And when Pharaoh saw that the rain and the hail and the thunders were ceased,<br>he sinned yet more, and hardened </b></i>{HB=kabed, honored}<i><b> his heart, he and his servants.<br>
9:35 And the heart of Pharaoh was hardened </b></i>{HB=chazaq, strengthened}<i><b>,<br>neither would he let the children of Israel go; as the LORD had spoken by Moses.</i></b></dt><dl>
<dt>Prior to this plague, the Lord --<ul>
<li>restated His reason for the plagues, and for Pharaoh's existence:<br>
&quot;...that you many know that there is none like Me in all the earth.&quot; <a href="ex9.htm#14" target="lwr_lt">v.14-17</a>; cp. <a href="ex8.htm#10">8:10</a>; cp. <a href="rom9.htm#17">Rom 9:17</a>
<li>warned everyone, who would hear, to protect life and property. <a href="ex9.htm#18" target="lwr_lt">v.18-21</a><br>Even the Egyptians would be differentiated, according to how they received God's Word.<br>God's people, whom He had set apart from those marked for destruction, were proof of the truth of His Word. cp. <a href="2cor2.htm#16">2Cor 2:16</a>; <a href="1pet2.htm#7">1Pet 2:7,8</a></ul>
<dt>Plague #7 - Hail destroys crops, kills men and animals -
<dd>The flax and barley were destroyed, because they were ready for harvest,</dd><dd>but the wheat and rye (spelt) was spared because the plants were still immature. <a href="ex9.htm#31" target="lwr_lt">v.31,32</a></dd>
<dd>Israel, protected by the LORD, escaped this storm.  <a href="ex9.htm#26" target="lwr_lt">v.26</a>; cp. <a href="ex9.htm#17" target="lwr_lt">v.17</a>; <a href="deu33.htm#26">Deu 33:26-29</a><ul>
<li><i>False gods judged</i> -<dd>Nut, the sky goddess.<br>Isis, whose tears were supposed to cause the Nile to overflow periodically to water the land.<dt>
<li><i>Magicians' response</i> - (silence)
<dd>It is possible that some of them privately took action, in fear of the Lord (<a href="ex9.htm#20" target="lwr_lt">v.20</a>).<dt>
<li><i>Pharaoh's response</i> -<ol type="a">
<li>confessed his sin of rebellion against the Lord (<a href="ex9.htm#27" target="lwr_lt">v.27</a>).
<li>asked Moses to entreat the Lord to remove the plague (<a href="ex9.htm#28" target="lwr_lt">v.28</a>).<br>
<li>he honored his heart... his heart was strengthened in his rebellion... he would not let Israel go.</ol></ul>
