Colossians   3<br> 1. If ye then be risen with Christ, seek those things which are above, where Christ sitteth on the right hand of God.<br><a name="2">2</a>  Set your affection on things above, not on things on the earth.<br><a name="3">3</a>  For ye are dead, and your life is hid with Christ in God.<br><a name="4">4</a>  When Christ, [who is] our life, shall appear, then shall ye also appear with him in glory.<br><a name="5">5</a>. Mortify therefore your members which are upon the earth; fornication, uncleanness, inordinate affection, evil concupiscence, and covetousness, which is idolatry:<br><a name="6">6</a>  For which things' sake the wrath of God cometh on the children of disobedience:<br><a name="7">7</a>  In the which ye also walked some time, when ye lived in them.<br><a name="8">8</a>. But now ye also put off all these; anger, wrath, malice, blasphemy, filthy communication out of your mouth.<br><a name="9">9</a>  Lie not one to another, seeing that ye have put off the old man with his deeds;<br><a name="10">10</a>  And have put on the new [man], which is renewed in knowledge after the image of him that created him:<br><a name="11">11</a>  Where there is neither Greek nor Jew, circumcision nor uncircumcision, Barbarian, Scythian, bond [nor] free: but Christ [is] all, and in all.<br><a name="12">12</a>. Put on therefore, as the elect of God, holy and beloved, bowels of mercies, kindness, humbleness of mind, meekness, longsuffering;<br><a name="13">13</a>  Forbearing one another, and forgiving one another, if any man have a quarrel against any: even as Christ forgave you, so also [do] ye.<br><a name="14">14</a>  And above all these things [put on] charity, which is the bond of perfectness.<br><a name="15">15</a>  And let the peace of God rule in your hearts, to the which also ye are called in one body; and be ye thankful.<br><a name="16">16</a>  Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom; teaching and admonishing one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing with grace in your hearts to the Lord.<br><a name="17">17</a>  And whatsoever ye do in word or deed, [do] all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God and the Father by him.<br><a name="18">18</a>. Wives, submit yourselves unto your own husbands, as it is fit in the Lord.<br><a name="19">19</a>  Husbands, love [your] wives, and be not bitter against them.<br><a name="20">20</a>  Children, obey [your] parents in all things: for this is well pleasing unto the Lord.<br><a name="21">21</a>  Fathers, provoke not your children [to anger], lest they be discouraged.<br><a name="22">22</a>  Servants, obey in all things [your] masters according to the flesh; not with eyeservice, as menpleasers; but in singleness of heart, fearing God:<br><a name="23">23</a>  And whatsoever ye do, do [it] heartily, as to the Lord, and not unto men;<br><a name="24">24</a>  Knowing that of the Lord ye shall receive the reward of the inheritance: for ye serve the Lord Christ.<br><a name="25">25</a>  But he that doeth wrong shall receive for the wrong which he hath done: and there is no respect of persons.<br><br>Go to <a href="col4.htm#1">Colossians 4</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
