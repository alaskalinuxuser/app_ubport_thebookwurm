<dt><b>5 - The Offerings</b> - <a href="lev1.htm" target="lwr_lt">Lev 1 - 7</a><br><dd>
<b>Introduction-</b> The only ground of forgiveness and acceptance for Israel before God was acceptable offerings. The five kinds of offerings all pointed typically to the Christ, the sum and fulfillment of them all. (<a href="heb10.htm#1">Heb 10:1-17</a>) He is the offering that God provided, through whom sinful man is forgiven and accepted in the Father's holy presence. <a href="joh1.htm#29">Joh 1:29</a>; <a href="joh14.htm#6">14:6</a><p>
<b>The Burnt Offering,</b> willingly and wholly offered unto God for the acceptance of the offerer, is typical of Christ, who so delighted in doing God's will that He obeyed the Father absolutely, perfectly, pleasing Him in all things in His life and then becoming obedient unto death for us. (<a href="joh8.htm#29">Joh 8:29</a>; <a href="gal1.htm#4">Gal 1:4</a>; <a href="php2.htm#8">Php 2:8</a>; <a href="joh3.htm#16">Joh 3:16</a>) Christ's perfect obedience, and therefore perfect holiness, is the perfect basis for God's acceptance of His death for us, and thus of our acceptance in Him. The acceptance of all other sacrifices depended upon the acceptance of the Whole Burnt Offering. The ascending smoke of the consumed Burnt Offering was the testimony that God accepted the offering. So the resurrection and ascension of Christ is the eternal proof of God's acceptance of Him, and of every believer in Him. <a href="eph1.htm#6">Eph 1:6</a>; <a href="eph2.htm#6">2:6</a>
</p><p>
<b>The Meat Offering</b> [ie., Meal Offering], of fine flour, ground between the upper and nether mill-stones, was the food of the priests and their families, after a handful, anointed with oil, was offered unto God. It typifies Christ, anointed with the Spirit, loving, living, and dying for man by the hand of lawless men, yet according to the determined counsel and foreknowledge of God. (<a href="act10.htm#38">Acts 10:38</a>; <a href="eph5.htm#2">Eph 5:2-6</a>; <a href="act2.htm#23">Acts 2:23</a>) Christ as the Meat [meal] Offering, meets the demand of God against man, because of man's lack of love toward his fellowmen, and becomes also the one to supply that need in the believer's heart by filling us with His love for others. <a href="2cor5.htm#14">2Cor 5:14</a>
</p><p>
<b>The Peace Offering</b> was eaten by the Levites after the fat, the food of the offering for God, had been burned on the altar with the Burnt Offering. This offering is a type of Christ as the One who reconciled us to God, by giving to God that which satisfied and delights God, and which satisfies Christ, the Priest, and the Offerer, and thus satisfies us in Him. The Peace Offering depended upon the Whole Burnt Offering for its acceptance, but it was a crowning result of Christ satisfying God's claim against us by bearing our sins and being made sin for us. <a href="eph5.htm#2">Eph 5:2</a>; <a href="1pet2.htm#24">1Pet 2:24</a>; <a href="2cor5.htm#21">2Cor 5:21</a>
</p><p>
<b>The Sin Offering</b> was a sacrifice atoning for the sins committed ignorantly, and is typical of Christ bearing the judgment of God against man's sinful nature. (<a href="eph2.htm#3">Eph 2:3</a>) The sinful nature inherited from the first Adam was judged in the death of the Second Adam, as the Head of the new race of which every believer is a member. (<a href="1cor15.htm#41">1Cor 15:41-45</a>; <a href="rom5.htm#12">Rom 5:12 to 8:39</a>; <a href="2cor5.htm#17">2Cor 5:17</a>) But He who was made sin for us was made unto us sanctification and redemption also, for in Him not only was our sinful nature judged, thus delivering us from the power of sin, but His own divine nature is imparted to every believer, and thus power to please God [is] realized in the fulness of the Holy Spirit. <a href="1cor1.htm#30">1Cor 1:30</a>; <a href="2pet1.htm#4">2Pet 1:4</a>; <a href="rom8.htm#13">Rom 8:13</a>
</p><p>
<b>The Trespass Offering</b> was a sacrifice atoning for known sins, and is typical of Christ as the One who bore in His own body the penalty of man's sinful acts, words, deeds, and thoughts. (<a href="rom5.htm#6">Rom 5:6</a>; <a href="1pet2.htm#24">1Pet 2:24</a>; <a href="1cor15.htm#3">1Cor 15:3,4</a>) By His act of faith in laying down His life for us, He made it possible for God to manifest His righteousness, in dealing with man's sins in such a way that He maintains His holy character and government, and at the same time justifies every sinner who believes that Christ died for his sins. Oh, what holiness and love, what truth and grace, what righteousness and peace kissed each other on the cross, and all for me. <a href="psa85.htm#10">Psa 85:10</a></p></dl>
