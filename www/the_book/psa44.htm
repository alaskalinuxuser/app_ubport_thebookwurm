Psalms  44<br>1. To the chief Musician for the sons of Korah, Maschil. We have heard with our ears, O God, our fathers have told us, [what] work thou didst in their days, in the times of old.<br><a name="2">2</a>  [How] thou didst drive out the heathen with thy hand, and plantedst them; [how] thou didst afflict the people, and cast them out.<br><a name="3">3</a>  For they got not the land in possession by their own sword, neither did their own arm save them: but thy right hand, and thine arm, and the light of thy countenance, because thou hadst a favour unto them.<br><a name="4">4</a>  Thou art my King, O God: command deliverances for Jacob.<br><a name="5">5</a>  Through thee will we push down our enemies: through thy name will we tread them under that rise up against us.<br><a name="6">6</a>  For I will not trust in my bow, neither shall my sword save me.<br><a name="7">7</a>  But thou hast saved us from our enemies, and hast put them to shame that hated us.<br><a name="8">8</a>  In God we boast all the day long, and praise thy name for ever. Selah.<br><a name="9">9</a>. But thou hast cast off, and put us to shame; and goest not forth with our armies.<br><a name="10">10</a>  Thou makest us to turn back from the enemy: and they which hate us spoil for themselves.<br><a name="11">11</a>  Thou hast given us like sheep [appointed] for meat; and hast scattered us among the heathen.<br><a name="12">12</a>  Thou sellest thy people for nought, and dost not increase [thy wealth] by their price.<br><a name="13">13</a>  Thou makest us a reproach to our neighbours, a scorn and a derision to them that are round about us.<br><a name="14">14</a>  Thou makest us a byword among the heathen, a shaking of the head among the people.<br><a name="15">15</a>  My confusion [is] continually before me, and the shame of my face hath covered me,<br><a name="16">16</a>  For the voice of him that reproacheth and blasphemeth; by reason of the enemy and avenger.<br><a name="17">17</a>. All this is come upon us; yet have we not forgotten thee, neither have we dealt falsely in thy covenant.<br><a name="18">18</a>  Our heart is not turned back, neither have our steps declined from thy way;<br><a name="19">19</a>  Though thou hast sore broken us in the place of dragons, and covered us with the shadow of death.<br><a name="20">20</a>  If we have forgotten the name of our God, or stretched out our hands to a strange god;<br><a name="21">21</a>  Shall not God search this out? for he knoweth the secrets of the heart.<br><a name="22">22</a>  Yea, for thy sake are we killed all the day long; we are counted as sheep for the slaughter.<br><a name="23">23</a>  Awake, why sleepest thou, O Lord? arise, cast [us] not off for ever.<br><a name="24">24</a>  Wherefore hidest thou thy face, [and] forgettest our affliction and our oppression?<br><a name="25">25</a>  For our soul is bowed down to the dust: our belly cleaveth unto the earth.<br><a name="26">26</a>  Arise for our help, and redeem us for thy mercies' sake.<br><br>Go to <a href="psa45.htm#1">Psalm 45</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
