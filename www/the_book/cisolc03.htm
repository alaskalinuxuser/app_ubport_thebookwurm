<b>Volume 3, Lesson 3</b><br>
by C.I. Scofield
<h2>The Dispensations, Part III</h2></center>
<p><b>NOTE:</b> <i>Several of the subjects touched in <b>Volume 3</b> of these <b>Bible Study Outlines </b> are also dealt with in <b>Rightly Dividing the Word of Truth</b>, by the same author. While the material in the two publications is very similar, there would be profit in doing an initial study in one publication and then reviewing the subject in the other. Both publications, and the associated <a href="dspch_go.htm" target="_blank"><b>Chart of the Seven Dispensations</b></a>, can be accessed via the <a href="int_menu.htm#rdwt" target="lwr_lt">Resource Menu</a>.</i></p>

<li>This dispensation is introduced by a series of events which immediately follow the taking away of the Church. These events occupy the seventieth week (seven years per week) of the prophecy of Daniel, and are fully described in <a href="rev6.htm#1">Revelation 6 to 18</a>. The whole period is called &quot;the great tribulation.&quot; During this time, the Church will be &quot;with the Lord&quot; (<a href="1the4.htm#17">1Thessalonians 4:17</a>). But the earth and those remaining on it will be swept with awful judgments. During this time, a remnant of the Jews, and an innumerable host of Gentiles, will turn to the Lord and find salvation, though they will not have the special privileges of the Church (<a href="rev7.htm#4">Revelation 7:4-17</a>).<ul>
<li><a href="mat24.htm#21">Matthew 24:21,22</a> - &quot;Then shall be great tribulation&quot;
<li><a href="dan12.htm#1">Daniel 12:1</a> - &quot;There shall be a time of trouble&quot;</ul>
<li>After this will occur the personal and glorious coming of Christ to the earth with His saints and the holy angels.<ul>
<li><a href="mat24.htm#29">Matthew 24:29,30</a> - &quot;Immediately after the tribulation&quot;
<li><a href="jude1.htm#14">Jude 1:14,15</a> - &quot;The Lord cometh with ten thousands of His saints&quot;
<li><a href="zech14.htm#4">Zechariah 14:4,5</a> - &quot;His feet shall stand in that day upon the Mount of Olives&quot;
<li><a href="rev20.htm#1">Revelation 20:1,2</a> - &quot;Satan... and bound him a thousand years&quot;</ul>
<li>The Lord then judges the living nations according to their treatment of His &quot;brethren&quot; who are the Jews of <a href="rev7.htm#1">Revelation 7</a>.<ul>
<li><a href="mat25.htm#31">Matthew 25:31-46</a> - &quot;He shall separate them&quot;</ul>
<li>Then begins, properly speaking, the seventh dispensation. During one thousand years, the Lord reigns over restored Israel and the Gentile nations. The seat of government will be Jerusalem, and the saints of this [present] dispensation [of Grace] (the Church saints) will be associated with Him in His rule.<ul>
<li><a href="rev20.htm#4">Revelation 20:4-6</a> - &quot;Shall reign with Him a thousand years&quot;
<li><a href="isa2.htm#2">Isaiah 2:2-4</a> - &quot;He shall judge among the nations&quot;
<li><a href="jer23.htm#5">Jeremiah 23:5-8</a> - &quot;Shall execute judgment and justice in the earth&quot;
<li><a href="luk22.htm#30">Luke 22:30</a> - &quot;Ye may eat and drink at My table in My kingdom&quot;
<li><a href="isa11.htm#10">Isaiah 11:10-12</a> - &quot;His rest shall be glorious&quot;</ul>
<li>But when Satan is &quot;loosed a little season&quot; he finds the natural heart as prone to evil as ever, and easily gathers the nations to battle against the Lord and His saints and this dispensation closes, like all others, in judgment. The &quot;great white throne&quot; is set, the wicked dead are raised and finally judged, and then come the &quot;new heaven and a new earth.&quot;<ul>
<li><a href="rev20.htm#3">Revelation 20:3</a> - &quot;[Satan] must be loosed a little season &quot;
<li><a href="rev20.htm#7">Revelation 20:7-15</a> - &quot;I saw a great white throne... and the books were opened&quot;</ul>
<li>Then in <a href="rev21.htm#1">Revelation 21 and 22</a>, eternity has begun.</ol></dl>
