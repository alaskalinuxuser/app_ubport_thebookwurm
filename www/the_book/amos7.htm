Amos   7<br>1. Thus hath the Lord GOD shewed unto me; and, behold, he formed grasshoppers in the beginning of the shooting up of the latter growth; and, lo, [it was] the latter growth after the king's mowings.<br><a name="2">2</a>  And it came to pass, [that] when they had made an end of eating the grass of the land, then I said, O Lord GOD, forgive, I beseech thee: by whom shall Jacob arise? for he [is] small.<br><a name="3">3</a>  The LORD repented for this: It shall not be, saith the LORD.<br><a name="4">4</a>  Thus hath the Lord GOD shewed unto me: and, behold, the Lord GOD called to contend by fire, and it devoured the great deep, and did eat up a part.<br><a name="5">5</a>  Then said I, O Lord GOD, cease, I beseech thee: by whom shall Jacob arise? for he [is] small.<br><a name="6">6</a>  The LORD repented for this: This also shall not be, saith the Lord GOD.<br><a name="7">7</a>  Thus he shewed me: and, behold, the Lord stood upon a wall [made] by a plumbline, with a plumbline in his hand.<br><a name="8">8</a>  And the LORD said unto me, Amos, what seest thou? And I said, A plumbline. Then said the Lord, Behold, I will set a plumbline in the midst of my people Israel: I will not again pass by them any more:<br><a name="9">9</a>  And the high places of Isaac shall be desolate, and the sanctuaries of Israel shall be laid waste; and I will rise against the house of Jeroboam with the sword.<br><a name="10">10</a>. Then Amaziah the priest of Bethel sent to Jeroboam king of Israel, saying, Amos hath conspired against thee in the midst of the house of Israel: the land is not able to bear all his words.<br><a name="11">11</a>  For thus Amos saith, Jeroboam shall die by the sword, and Israel shall surely be led away captive out of their own land.<br><a name="12">12</a>  Also Amaziah said unto Amos, O thou seer, go, flee thee away into the land of Judah, and there eat bread, and prophesy there:<br><a name="13">13</a>  But prophesy not again any more at Bethel: for it [is] the king's chapel, and it [is] the king's court.<br><a name="14">14</a>  Then answered Amos, and said to Amaziah, I [was] no prophet, neither [was] I a prophet's son; but I [was] an herdman, and a gatherer of sycomore fruit:<br><a name="15">15</a>  And the LORD took me as I followed the flock, and the LORD said unto me, Go, prophesy unto my people Israel.<br><a name="16">16</a>  Now therefore hear thou the word of the LORD: Thou sayest, Prophesy not against Israel, and drop not [thy word] against the house of Isaac.<br><a name="17">17</a>  Therefore thus saith the LORD; Thy wife shall be an harlot in the city, and thy sons and thy daughters shall fall by the sword, and thy land shall be divided by line; and thou shalt die in a polluted land: and Israel shall surely go into captivity forth of his land.<br><br>Go to <a href="amos8.htm#1">Amos 8</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
