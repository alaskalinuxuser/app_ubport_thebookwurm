<dl><dd>
Just as Seal #6 was followed by an explanatory parenthetic episode, so here following Trumpet #6. <br>This parenthetic section contains 3 episodes: <ul><li>The angel with a little book (<a href="rev10.htm#1" target="lwr_lt">10:1-11</a>), <li>The measuring of the Temple (11:1,2), and <li>The martyrdom of the two witnesses (11:3-12).</ul><a name="1"></a><dt>
<b><i>10:1 And I saw another mighty angel come down from heaven,</i></b></dt><dl>
<dt>&quot;I saw&quot; opens one vision which continues to <a href="rev13.htm#1">13:1</a> (the next &quot;I saw&quot;).
<dt>Who is this angel? <dd>Some say Christ. But in the Revelation, Christ is not referred to as an angel. Compare <a href="rev5.htm#2">5:2</a>, where another &quot;strong angel&quot; (strong &amp; mighty are same GK word), turns John's attention to the Lamb. It is self-evident, that that angel is not Christ.
<dd>This angel has several features which remind us of Christ because he is His special representative, but we will see some differences shortly.</dl><dt>

<dt>Outline of Daniel 10-12: (In this outline, the chapter &amp; verse references are to Daniel, unless noted.)<ol type="A">
<li><a href="dan10.htm#4">10:4-21</a> The Heavenly Messenger: Some see as Christ, others as an archangel.<ol type="a">
<li>This messenger is similar in appearance to Christ (<a href="dan10.htm#4">10:4-6</a>, <a href="rev1.htm#13">Rev 1:13-16</a> &amp; <a href="rev10.htm#1" target="lwr_lt">Rev 10:1</a>).
<li>The messenger's presence profoundly effects Daniel (<a href="dan10.htm#7">10:7-10,15-19</a>, <a href="rev1.htm#17">Rev 1:17</a> &amp; <a href="rev10.htm#1" target="lwr_lt">Rev 10:1</a>).
<li>Yet, this messenger is <i>sent</i> with a message from God (Christ is God the Son). (See 
<a href="dan10.htm#10">Dan 10:10,11</a>).<ul><li>As an angelic representative of God, the messenger reflects the glory of the One who sent him.
<li>An archangel (perhaps Gabriel cp. <a href="dan9.htm#21">9:21</a>, a peer to Michael, cp. <a href="dan10.htm#12">10:12-13,20-21</a>) -
<dd>-- prepared Daniel to receive the message (<a href="dan10.htm#10">10:10-12,18-19</a>)
<br>-- stated that the prophecy relates to Daniel's people (Israel, <a href="dan10.htm#14">10:14</a>).
<br>-- conveyed the prophetic message (as do angels in much of Rev.)</dd></ul></ol>
<li>The Timing of the prophetic message delivered by the archangel -<ol type="1">
<li><a href="dan11.htm#1">11:1-35</a> From Daniel's time into the relatively near future.
<dd>This prophecy concerns nations that would impact the people &amp; land of Israel, looking from Daniel's time into the relatively near future. The prophecy traces...<ul><li>the progression of the Medo-Persian empire (v.1,2), <li>its succession by the Grecian empire, including the rise of Alexander (v.3),<li>the division of his empire into four parts (v.4),<li>the troubled decline of two of the parts (v.5-20), and<li>the rise to power of Antiochus Epiphanes (v.21-35, c. 175-163 BC).</ul>(These events have been fulfilled.)</dd></ul>
<li><a href="dan11.htm#36">11:36-45</a> Prophecy concerning the &quot;willful king&quot;<dd>(the antichrist, of whom Antiochus Epiphanes was a &quot;type&quot; or foreshadowing), who -<ul>
<li>will arise &quot;at the time of the end&quot; (v.40), and 
<li>will establish himself &quot;in the glorious holy mountain&quot; (v.45, ie., the temple in Jerusalem).</ul></dd>
<li><a href="dan12.htm#1">12:1- </a> At that time (ie., the time of the antichrist) -<dd><ul>
<li>Michael shall stand up...<li>there shall be a time of great trouble...<li>Daniel's people shall be delivered...</ul></dd>
Rev. 10 deals with &quot;that time.&quot; Therefore, this angel (in <a href="rev10.htm#1" target="lwr_lt">Rev 10:1</a>) is Michael arising to fulfil his prophetic role.
<dd>&quot;Michael&quot; means &quot;who is like God&quot; (which may be phrased as a question or a statement).
<br>Christ IS God. Michael appears like Him, as he shines in Christ's glory. 
<br>Michael's part in deposing Satan answers the question posed by his name. cp. <a href="rev12.htm#7">Rev 12:7-9</a>; <a href="isa14.htm#12">Isa 14:12-17</a></ol></ol><dt>
<b><i>10:2 And he had in his hand a little book open:</i></b></dt><dl>
<dt>little book- The GK word is a diminutive form of &quot;scroll&quot;, lit., &quot;scrollette.&quot;
<dt>open- In ch. 5, Christ receives a closed book, the 7 sealed scroll.
<dd>In ch. 6, He begins to open it. 
<br>By ch. 10, the seals have all been broken, and much of the content has been applied.  <dd>This is the same &quot;opened&quot; book. Its &quot;littleness&quot; represents those few things yet remaining for completion. God's counsels are forever settled in heaven. His promises &amp; judgments are &quot;noted in the Scripture of Truth&quot; which the angel opened to Daniel. <a href="dan10.htm#21">Dan 10:21</a>; <a href="dan12.htm#4">12:4</a></dl><dt>
<b><i>and he set his right foot upon the sea, and [his] left [foot] on the earth,</i></b>
<dd>The angel claims sea and earth for God. 
<br>The book is the basis of his authority. <a href="psa95.htm#5">Psa 95:5</a><dt>
<b><i>10:3 And cried with a loud voice, as [when] a lion roareth:</i></b>
<dd>His roar is expectant of triumph over the adversary. cp. <a href="rev12.htm#7">Rev 12:7-9</a><dt>
<b><i>and when he had cried, seven thunders uttered their voices.</i></b>
<dd>Jews refer to thunder as &quot;the seven voices&quot; (of God).<br>The phrase &quot;the voice of the Lord&quot; occurs 7x in <a href="psa29.htm#3">Psa 29:3-9</a>.<dt>
<b><i>10:4 And when the seven thunders had uttered their voices, I was about to write: <br>
and I heard a voice from heaven saying unto me, <br>
Seal up those things which the seven thunders uttered, and write them not.</i></b>
<dd>We would be foolish to attempt to interpret what God has kept secret.
<br>Why has He &quot;covered&quot; this in the middle of 'Revelation' (GK title 'apokalupsis,' &quot;uncovering,&quot; <a href="rev1.htm#1">1:1</a>)?
<br>We'll know soon enough (&quot;for the time is at hand,&quot; <a href="rev1.htm#3">1:3</a>).<dt>
<b><i>10:5 And the angel which I saw stand upon the sea and upon the earth<br>
lifted up his hand to heaven,<br>
10:6 And sware by him that liveth for ever and ever,<br>
who created heaven, and the things that therein are, <br>
and the earth, and the things that therein are, <br>
and the sea, and the things which are therein,<br>
that there should be time no longer:</i></b></dt><dl>
<dt>sware by Him- The angel's authority to claim sea &amp; earth is from the Creator.
<dd> Note: If this angel were Christ, He would not so swear, since He <i>is</i> the Creator, and He can swear by no greater. <a href="joh1.htm#1">Joh 1:1-3</a>; <a href="heb6.htm#13">Heb 6:13</a>
<dt>there should be time {GK= chronos} no longer-
<dd>Some versions read &quot;delay no longer&quot; (in an attempt to accommodate the fact that time as a phenomenon continues - eg., the millennium). But of the 110 occurrences of 'chronos' in the OT (Septuagint) and NT, nowhere else is it translated &quot;delay.&quot; There is no delay in the progression of God's programs. cp. <a href="mat24.htm#48">Mat 24:48</a>; <a href="2pet3.htm#9">2Pet 3:9</a>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Chronos' often refers to a <i>period of time </i>(eg., &quot;a space,&quot; <a href="rev2.htm#21">Rev 2:21</a>; &quot;a season,&quot; <a href="rev6.htm#10">6:10,11</a>).<br>This meaning applies here. The angel is announcing the end of a period of time, namely, the time that would elapse prior &quot;to the time of the end&quot; (<a href="dan12.htm#4">Dan 12:4</a>). The end of that time marks the beginning of the time of the end, a period of 3.5 years (<a href="dan12.htm#6">Dan 12:6,7</a>), which the angel announces in the following verse...</dl><dt>
<b><i>10:7 But </i></b>{ie., in fact} <b><i>in the days of the voice of the seventh angel, </i></b> {ie., Trumpet #7}<br>
<b><i>when he shall begin </i></b>{ie., is about}<i><b> to sound, </i></b> {ie., &quot;When his turn comes.&quot;}<br>
<b><i>the mystery of God should be finished,</i></b> {lit., shall also be completed}<br>
<b><i>as he hath declared to his servants the prophets.</i></b>
<dd>A mystery is something which man would not know unless God chooses to reveal it.
<dd>That which He has revealed through His prophets is about to come to conclusion.
<dd><a href="amos3.htm#7">Amos 3:7</a>; <a href="dan9.htm#24">Dan 9:24</a>; <a href="deu29.htm#24">Deu 29:24-29</a>; <a href="deu30.htm#1">30:1-7</a><dt>
<b><i>10:8 And the voice which I heard from heaven spake unto me again, and said, <br>
Go [and] take the little book which is open in the hand of the <br>
angel which standeth upon the sea and upon the earth.</i></b>
<dd>the voice... from heaven - is that of Christ. cp. <a href="rev4.htm#1">4:1</a>; <a href="rev10.htm#4" target="lwr_lt">10:4</a><dt>
<b><i>10:9 And I went unto the angel, and said unto him, Give me the little book.<br>
And he said unto me, Take [it], and eat it up;<br>
and it shall make thy belly bitter, but it shall be in thy mouth sweet as honey.</i></b></dt><dl>
<dt>To eat the Word of God, is to take it to heart.
<dt>sweet... bitter-<dd><ul>
<li>Delight with the fact of new revelation. . .
<br>. . .Distress with the nature of that revelation. [JBSmith]
<li>Joy at the prospect of the age of righteousness. . .
<br>. . .Grief at the judgment &amp; martyrdom which must precede it.
<li>Joy in personal renewal by that which proceeds from the mouth of God. . .
<br>. . .Grief at the deafness of those to whom the Word is delivered.
<br>cp. <a href="jer15.htm#16">Jer 15:16-18</a>; <a href="eze2.htm#8">Eze 2:8-10</a>; <a href="eze3.htm#1">3:1-4,7,14</a></ul></dd></dl><dt>
<b><i>10:10 And I took the little book out of the angel's hand, and ate it up;<br>
and it was in my mouth sweet as honey:<br>
and as soon as I had eaten it, my belly was bitter.<br>
10:11 And he said unto me, Thou must prophesy again before</i></b> {or, 'about'} <br>
<b><i>many peoples, and nations, and tongues, and kings.</i></b></dt><dl>
<dt>Having been warned that it will bring personal joy and also heartbreak,
<dd>John is re-commissioned to proclaim God's prophetic message.
<dt>prophesy again - Since he has already prophesied about these things, 
<dd>this suggests that subsequent chapters will review these things and provide further detail.
