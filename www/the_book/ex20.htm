Exodus  20<br>1. And God spake all these words, saying,<br><a name="2">2</a>  I [am] the LORD thy God, which have brought thee out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage.<br><a name="3">3</a>  Thou shalt have no other gods before me.<br><a name="4">4</a>  Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image, or any likeness [of any thing] that [is] in heaven above, or that [is] in the earth beneath, or that [is] in the water under the earth:<br><a name="5">5</a>  Thou shalt not bow down thyself to them, nor serve them: for I the LORD thy God [am] a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth [generation] of them that hate me;<br><a name="6">6</a>  And shewing mercy unto thousands of them that love me, and keep my commandments.<br><a name="7">7</a>  Thou shalt not take the name of the LORD thy God in vain; for the LORD will not hold him guiltless that taketh his name in vain.<br><a name="8">8</a>  Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy.<br><a name="9">9</a>  Six days shalt thou labour, and do all thy work:<br><a name="10">10</a>  But the seventh day [is] the sabbath of the LORD thy God: [in it] thou shalt not do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, thy manservant, nor thy maidservant, nor thy cattle, nor thy stranger that [is] within thy gates:<br><a name="11">11</a>  For [in] six days the LORD made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them [is], and rested the seventh day: wherefore the LORD blessed the sabbath day, and hallowed it.<br><a name="12">12</a>. Honour thy father and thy mother: that thy days may be long upon the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee.<br><a name="13">13</a>  Thou shalt not kill.<br><a name="14">14</a>  Thou shalt not commit adultery.<br><a name="15">15</a>  Thou shalt not steal.<br><a name="16">16</a>  Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbour.<br><a name="17">17</a>  Thou shalt not covet thy neighbour's house, thou shalt not covet thy neighbour's wife, nor his manservant, nor his maidservant, nor his ox, nor his ass, nor any thing that [is] thy neighbour's.<br><a name="18">18</a>. And all the people saw the thunderings, and the lightnings, and the noise of the trumpet, and the mountain smoking: and when the people saw [it], they removed, and stood afar off.<br><a name="19">19</a>  And they said unto Moses, Speak thou with us, and we will hear: but let not God speak with us, lest we die.<br><a name="20">20</a>  And Moses said unto the people, Fear not: for God is come to prove you, and that his fear may be before your faces, that ye sin not.<br><a name="21">21</a>  And the people stood afar off, and Moses drew near unto the thick darkness where God [was].<br><a name="22">22</a>. And the LORD said unto Moses, Thus thou shalt say unto the children of Israel, Ye have seen that I have talked with you from heaven.<br><a name="23">23</a>  Ye shall not make with me gods of silver, neither shall ye make unto you gods of gold.<br><a name="24">24</a>  An altar of earth thou shalt make unto me, and shalt sacrifice thereon thy burnt offerings, and thy peace offerings, thy sheep, and thine oxen: in all places where I record my name I will come unto thee, and I will bless thee.<br><a name="25">25</a>  And if thou wilt make me an altar of stone, thou shalt not build it of hewn stone: for if thou lift up thy tool upon it, thou hast polluted it.<br><a name="26">26</a>  Neither shalt thou go up by steps unto mine altar, that thy nakedness be not discovered thereon.<br><br>Go to <a href="ex21.htm#1">Exodus 21</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
