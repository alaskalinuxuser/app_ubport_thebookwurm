Luke  17<br>1. Then said he unto the disciples, It is impossible but that offences will come: but woe [unto him], through whom they come!<br><a name="2">2</a>  It were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck, and he cast into the sea, than that he should offend one of these little ones.<br><a name="3">3</a>  Take heed to yourselves: If thy brother trespass against thee, rebuke him; and if he repent, forgive him.<br><a name="4">4</a>  And if he trespass against thee seven times in a day, and seven times in a day turn again to thee, saying, I repent; thou shalt forgive him.<br><a name="5">5</a>  And the apostles said unto the Lord, Increase our faith.<br><a name="6">6</a>  And the Lord said, If ye had faith as a grain of mustard seed, ye might say unto this sycamine tree, Be thou plucked up by the root, and be thou planted in the sea; and it should obey you.<br><a name="7">7</a>  But which of you, having a servant plowing or feeding cattle, will say unto him by and by, when he is come from the field, Go and sit down to meat?<br><a name="8">8</a>  And will not rather say unto him, Make ready wherewith I may sup, and gird thyself, and serve me, till I have eaten and drunken; and afterward thou shalt eat and drink?<br><a name="9">9</a>  Doth he thank that servant because he did the things that were commanded him? I trow not.<br><a name="10">10</a>  So likewise ye, when ye shall have done all those things which are commanded you, say, We are unprofitable servants: we have done that which was our duty to do.<br><a name="11">11</a>. And it came to pass, as he went to Jerusalem, that he passed through the midst of Samaria and Galilee.<br><a name="12">12</a>  And as he entered into a certain village, there met him ten men that were lepers, which stood afar off:<br><a name="13">13</a>  And they lifted up [their] voices, and said, Jesus, Master, have mercy on us.<br><a name="14">14</a>  And when he saw [them], he said unto them, Go shew yourselves unto the priests. And it came to pass, that, as they went, they were cleansed.<br><a name="15">15</a>  And one of them, when he saw that he was healed, turned back, and with a loud voice glorified God,<br><a name="16">16</a>  And fell down on [his] face at his feet, giving him thanks: and he was a Samaritan.<br><a name="17">17</a>  And Jesus answering said, Were there not ten cleansed? but where [are] the nine?<br><a name="18">18</a>  There are not found that returned to give glory to God, save this stranger.<br><a name="19">19</a>  And he said unto him, Arise, go thy way: thy faith hath made thee whole.<br><a name="20">20</a>. And when he was demanded of the Pharisees, when the kingdom of God should come, he answered them and said, The kingdom of God cometh not with observation:<br><a name="21">21</a>  Neither shall they say, Lo here! or, lo there! for, behold, the kingdom of God is within you.<br><a name="22">22</a>  And he said unto the disciples, The days will come, when ye shall desire to see one of the days of the Son of man, and ye shall not see [it].<br><a name="23">23</a>  And they shall say to you, See here; or, see there: go not after [them], nor follow [them].<br><a name="24">24</a>  For as the lightning, that lighteneth out of the one [part] under heaven, shineth unto the other [part] under heaven; so shall also the Son of man be in his day.<br><a name="25">25</a>  But first must he suffer many things, and be rejected of this generation.<br><a name="26">26</a>  And as it was in the days of Noe, so shall it be also in the days of the Son of man.<br><a name="27">27</a>  They did eat, they drank, they married wives, they were given in marriage, until the day that Noe entered into the ark, and the flood came, and destroyed them all.<br><a name="28">28</a>  Likewise also as it was in the days of Lot; they did eat, they drank, they bought, they sold, they planted, they builded;<br><a name="29">29</a>  But the same day that Lot went out of Sodom it rained fire and brimstone from heaven, and destroyed [them] all.<br><a name="30">30</a>  Even thus shall it be in the day when the Son of man is revealed.<br><a name="31">31</a>  In that day, he which shall be upon the housetop, and his stuff in the house, let him not come down to take it away: and he that is in the field, let him likewise not return back.<br><a name="32">32</a>  Remember Lot's wife.<br><a name="33">33</a>  Whosoever shall seek to save his life shall lose it; and whosoever shall lose his life shall preserve it.<br><a name="34">34</a>  I tell you, in that night there shall be two [men] in one bed; the one shall be taken, and the other shall be left.<br><a name="35">35</a>  Two [women] shall be grinding together; the one shall be taken, and the other left.<br><a name="36">36</a>  Two [men] shall be in the field; the one shall be taken, and the other left.<br><a name="37">37</a>  And they answered and said unto him, Where, Lord? And he said unto them, Wheresoever the body [is], thither will the eagles be gathered together.<br><br>Go to <a href="luk18.htm#1">Luke 18</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
