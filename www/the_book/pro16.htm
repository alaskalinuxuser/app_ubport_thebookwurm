Proverbs  16<br> 1. The preparations of the heart in man, and the answer of the tongue, [is] from the LORD.<br><a name="2">2</a>. All the ways of a man [are] clean in his own eyes; but the LORD weigheth the spirits.<br><a name="3">3</a>. Commit thy works unto the LORD, and thy thoughts shall be established.<br><a name="4">4</a>. The LORD hath made all [things] for himself: yea, even the wicked for the day of evil.<br><a name="5">5</a>. Every one [that is] proud in heart [is] an abomination to the LORD: [though] hand [join] in hand, he shall not be unpunished.<br><a name="6">6</a>. By mercy and truth iniquity is purged: and by the fear of the LORD [men] depart from evil.<br><a name="7">7</a>. When a man's ways please the LORD, he maketh even his enemies to be at peace with him.<br><a name="8">8</a>. Better [is] a little with righteousness than great revenues without right.<br><a name="9">9</a>. A man's heart deviseth his way: but the LORD directeth his steps.<br><a name="10">10</a>. A divine sentence [is] in the lips of the king: his mouth transgresseth not in judgment.<br><a name="11">11</a>. A just weight and balance [are] the LORD'S: all the weights of the bag [are] his work.<br><a name="12">12</a>. [It is] an abomination to kings to commit wickedness: for the throne is established by righteousness.<br><a name="13">13</a>. Righteous lips [are] the delight of kings; and they love him that speaketh right.<br><a name="14">14</a>. The wrath of a king [is as] messengers of death: but a wise man will pacify it.<br><a name="15">15</a>  In the light of the king's countenance [is] life; and his favour [is] as a cloud of the latter rain.<br><a name="16">16</a>. How much better [is it] to get wisdom than gold! and to get understanding rather to be chosen than silver!<br><a name="17">17</a>. The highway of the upright [is] to depart from evil: he that keepeth his way preserveth his soul.<br><a name="18">18</a>. Pride [goeth] before destruction, and an haughty spirit before a fall.<br><a name="19">19</a>. Better [it is to be] of an humble spirit with the lowly, than to divide the spoil with the proud.<br><a name="20">20</a>. He that handleth a matter wisely shall find good: and whoso trusteth in the LORD, happy [is] he.<br><a name="21">21</a>. The wise in heart shall be called prudent: and the sweetness of the lips increaseth learning.<br><a name="22">22</a>. Understanding [is] a wellspring of life unto him that hath it: but the instruction of fools [is] folly.<br><a name="23">23</a>. The heart of the wise teacheth his mouth, and addeth learning to his lips.<br><a name="24">24</a>. Pleasant words [are as] an honeycomb, sweet to the soul, and health to the bones.<br><a name="25">25</a>. There is a way that seemeth right unto a man, but the end thereof [are] the ways of death.<br><a name="26">26</a>. He that laboureth laboureth for himself; for his mouth craveth it of him.<br><a name="27">27</a>. An ungodly man diggeth up evil: and in his lips [there is] as a burning fire.<br><a name="28">28</a>  A froward man soweth strife: and a whisperer separateth chief friends.<br><a name="29">29</a>. A violent man enticeth his neighbour, and leadeth him into the way [that is] not good.<br><a name="30">30</a>  He shutteth his eyes to devise froward things: moving his lips he bringeth evil to pass.<br><a name="31">31</a>. The hoary head [is] a crown of glory, [if] it be found in the way of righteousness.<br><a name="32">32</a>. [He that is] slow to anger [is] better than the mighty; and he that ruleth his spirit than he that taketh a city.<br><a name="33">33</a>. The lot is cast into the lap; but the whole disposing thereof [is] of the LORD.<br><br>Go to <a href="pro17.htm#1">Proverbs 17</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
