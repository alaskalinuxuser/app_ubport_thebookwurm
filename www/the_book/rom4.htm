Romans   4<br> 1. What shall we say then that Abraham our father, as pertaining to the flesh, hath found?<br><a name="2">2</a>  For if Abraham were justified by works, he hath [whereof] to glory; but not before God.<br><a name="3">3</a>  For what saith the scripture? Abraham believed God, and it was counted unto him for righteousness.<br><a name="4">4</a>  Now to him that worketh is the reward not reckoned of grace, but of debt.<br><a name="5">5</a>  But to him that worketh not, but believeth on him that justifieth the ungodly, his faith is counted for righteousness.<br><a name="6">6</a>  Even as David also describeth the blessedness of the man, unto whom God imputeth righteousness without works,<br><a name="7">7</a>  [Saying], Blessed [are] they whose iniquities are forgiven, and whose sins are covered.<br><a name="8">8</a>  Blessed [is] the man to whom the Lord will not impute sin.<br><a name="9">9</a>. [Cometh] this blessedness then upon the circumcision [only], or upon the uncircumcision also? for we say that faith was reckoned to Abraham for righteousness.<br><a name="10">10</a>  How was it then reckoned? when he was in circumcision, or in uncircumcision? Not in circumcision, but in uncircumcision.<br><a name="11">11</a>  And he received the sign of circumcision, a seal of the righteousness of the faith which [he had yet] being uncircumcised: that he might be the father of all them that believe, though they be not circumcised; that righteousness might be imputed unto them also:<br><a name="12">12</a>  And the father of circumcision to them who are not of the circumcision only, but who also walk in the steps of that faith of our father Abraham, which [he had] being [yet] uncircumcised.<br><a name="13">13</a>  For the promise, that he should be the heir of the world, [was] not to Abraham, or to his seed, through the law, but through the righteousness of faith.<br><a name="14">14</a>  For if they which are of the law [be] heirs, faith is made void, and the promise made of none effect:<br><a name="15">15</a>  Because the law worketh wrath: for where no law is, [there is] no transgression.<br><a name="16">16</a>  Therefore [it is] of faith, that [it might be] by grace; to the end the promise might be sure to all the seed; not to that only which is of the law, but to that also which is of the faith of Abraham; who is the father of us all,<br><a name="17">17</a>. (As it is written, I have made thee a father of many nations,) before him whom he believed, [even] God, who quickeneth the dead, and calleth those things which be not as though they were.<br><a name="18">18</a>  Who against hope believed in hope, that he might become the father of many nations, according to that which was spoken, So shall thy seed be.<br><a name="19">19</a>  And being not weak in faith, he considered not his own body now dead, when he was about an hundred years old, neither yet the deadness of Sara's womb:<br><a name="20">20</a>  He staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief; but was strong in faith, giving glory to God;<br><a name="21">21</a>  And being fully persuaded that, what he had promised, he was able also to perform.<br><a name="22">22</a>  And therefore it was imputed to him for righteousness.<br><a name="23">23</a>. Now it was not written for his sake alone, that it was imputed to him;<br><a name="24">24</a>  But for us also, to whom it shall be imputed, if we believe on him that raised up Jesus our Lord from the dead;<br><a name="25">25</a>  Who was delivered for our offences, and was raised again for our justification.<br><br>Go to <a href="rom5.htm#1">Romans 5</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
