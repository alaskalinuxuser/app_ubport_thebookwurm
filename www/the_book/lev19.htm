Leviticus  19<br>1. And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,<br><a name="2">2</a>  Speak unto all the congregation of the children of Israel, and say unto them, Ye shall be holy: for I the LORD your God [am] holy.<br><a name="3">3</a>  Ye shall fear every man his mother, and his father, and keep my sabbaths: I [am] the LORD your God.<br><a name="4">4</a>  Turn ye not unto idols, nor make to yourselves molten gods: I [am] the LORD your God.<br><a name="5">5</a>  And if ye offer a sacrifice of peace offerings unto the LORD, ye shall offer it at your own will.<br><a name="6">6</a>  It shall be eaten the same day ye offer it, and on the morrow: and if ought remain until the third day, it shall be burnt in the fire.<br><a name="7">7</a>  And if it be eaten at all on the third day, it [is] abominable; it shall not be accepted.<br><a name="8">8</a>  Therefore [every one] that eateth it shall bear his iniquity, because he hath profaned the hallowed thing of the LORD: and that soul shall be cut off from among his people.<br><a name="9">9</a>  And when ye reap the harvest of your land, thou shalt not wholly reap the corners of thy field, neither shalt thou gather the gleanings of thy harvest.<br><a name="10">10</a>  And thou shalt not glean thy vineyard, neither shalt thou gather [every] grape of thy vineyard; thou shalt leave them for the poor and stranger: I [am] the LORD your God.<br><a name="11">11</a>. Ye shall not steal, neither deal falsely, neither lie one to another.<br><a name="12">12</a>  And ye shall not swear by my name falsely, neither shalt thou profane the name of thy God: I [am] the LORD.<br><a name="13">13</a>  Thou shalt not defraud thy neighbour, neither rob [him]: the wages of him that is hired shall not abide with thee all night until the morning.<br><a name="14">14</a>  Thou shalt not curse the deaf, nor put a stumblingblock before the blind, but shalt fear thy God: I [am] the LORD.<br><a name="15">15</a>  Ye shall do no unrighteousness in judgment: thou shalt not respect the person of the poor, nor honour the person of the mighty: [but] in righteousness shalt thou judge thy neighbour.<br><a name="16">16</a>  Thou shalt not go up and down [as] a talebearer among thy people: neither shalt thou stand against the blood of thy neighbour: I [am] the LORD.<br><a name="17">17</a>  Thou shalt not hate thy brother in thine heart: thou shalt in any wise rebuke thy neighbour, and not suffer sin upon him.<br><a name="18">18</a>  Thou shalt not avenge, nor bear any grudge against the children of thy people, but thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself: I [am] the LORD.<br><a name="19">19</a>. Ye shall keep my statutes. Thou shalt not let thy cattle gender with a diverse kind: thou shalt not sow thy field with mingled seed: neither shall a garment mingled of linen and woollen come upon thee.<br><a name="20">20</a>  And whosoever lieth carnally with a woman, that [is] a bondmaid, betrothed to an husband, and not at all redeemed, nor freedom given her; she shall be scourged; they shall not be put to death, because she was not free.<br><a name="21">21</a>  And he shall bring his trespass offering unto the LORD, unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, [even] a ram for a trespass offering.<br><a name="22">22</a>  And the priest shall make an atonement for him with the ram of the trespass offering before the LORD for his sin which he hath done: and the sin which he hath done shall be forgiven him.<br><a name="23">23</a>  And when ye shall come into the land, and shall have planted all manner of trees for food, then ye shall count the fruit thereof as uncircumcised: three years shall it be as uncircumcised unto you: it shall not be eaten of.<br><a name="24">24</a>  But in the fourth year all the fruit thereof shall be holy to praise the LORD [withal].<br><a name="25">25</a>  And in the fifth year shall ye eat of the fruit thereof, that it may yield unto you the increase thereof: I [am] the LORD your God.<br><a name="26">26</a>  Ye shall not eat [any thing] with the blood: neither shall ye use enchantment, nor observe times.<br><a name="27">27</a>  Ye shall not round the corners of your heads, neither shalt thou mar the corners of thy beard.<br><a name="28">28</a>  Ye shall not make any cuttings in your flesh for the dead, nor print any marks upon you: I [am] the LORD.<br><a name="29">29</a>  Do not prostitute thy daughter, to cause her to be a whore; lest the land fall to whoredom, and the land become full of wickedness.<br><a name="30">30</a>. Ye shall keep my sabbaths, and reverence my sanctuary: I [am] the LORD.<br><a name="31">31</a>  Regard not them that have familiar spirits, neither seek after wizards, to be defiled by them: I [am] the LORD your God.<br><a name="32">32</a>  Thou shalt rise up before the hoary head, and honour the face of the old man, and fear thy God: I [am] the LORD.<br><a name="33">33</a>  And if a stranger sojourn with thee in your land, ye shall not vex him.<br><a name="34">34</a>  [But] the stranger that dwelleth with you shall be unto you as one born among you, and thou shalt love him as thyself; for ye were strangers in the land of Egypt: I [am] the LORD your God.<br><a name="35">35</a>  Ye shall do no unrighteousness in judgment, in meteyard, in weight, or in measure.<br><a name="36">36</a>  Just balances, just weights, a just ephah, and a just hin, shall ye have: I [am] the LORD your God, which brought you out of the land of Egypt.<br><a name="37">37</a>  Therefore shall ye observe all my statutes, and all my judgments, and do them: I [am] the LORD.<br><br>Go to <a href="lev20.htm#1">Leviticus 20</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
