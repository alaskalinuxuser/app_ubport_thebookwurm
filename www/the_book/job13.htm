Job  13<br>1. Lo, mine eye hath seen all [this], mine ear hath heard and understood it.<br><a name="2">2</a>  What ye know, [the same] do I know also: I [am] not inferior unto you.<br><a name="3">3</a>  Surely I would speak to the Almighty, and I desire to reason with God.<br><a name="4">4</a>  But ye [are] forgers of lies, ye [are] all physicians of no value.<br><a name="5">5</a>  O that ye would altogether hold your peace! and it should be your wisdom.<br><a name="6">6</a>  Hear now my reasoning, and hearken to the pleadings of my lips.<br><a name="7">7</a>  Will ye speak wickedly for God? and talk deceitfully for him?<br><a name="8">8</a>  Will ye accept his person? will ye contend for God?<br><a name="9">9</a>  Is it good that he should search you out? or as one man mocketh another, do ye [so] mock him?<br><a name="10">10</a>  He will surely reprove you, if ye do secretly accept persons.<br><a name="11">11</a>  Shall not his excellency make you afraid? and his dread fall upon you?<br><a name="12">12</a>  Your remembrances [are] like unto ashes, your bodies to bodies of clay.<br><a name="13">13</a>. Hold your peace, let me alone, that I may speak, and let come on me what [will].<br><a name="14">14</a>  Wherefore do I take my flesh in my teeth, and put my life in mine hand?<br><a name="15">15</a>  Though he slay me, yet will I trust in him: but I will maintain mine own ways before him.<br><a name="16">16</a>  He also [shall be] my salvation: for an hypocrite shall not come before him.<br><a name="17">17</a>  Hear diligently my speech, and my declaration with your ears.<br><a name="18">18</a>  Behold now, I have ordered [my] cause; I know that I shall be justified.<br><a name="19">19</a>  Who [is] he [that] will plead with me? for now, if I hold my tongue, I shall give up the ghost.<br><a name="20">20</a>  Only do not two [things] unto me: then will I not hide myself from thee.<br><a name="21">21</a>  Withdraw thine hand far from me: and let not thy dread make me afraid.<br><a name="22">22</a>  Then call thou, and I will answer: or let me speak, and answer thou me.<br><a name="23">23</a>. How many [are] mine iniquities and sins? make me to know my transgression and my sin.<br><a name="24">24</a>  Wherefore hidest thou thy face, and holdest me for thine enemy?<br><a name="25">25</a>  Wilt thou break a leaf driven to and fro? and wilt thou pursue the dry stubble?<br><a name="26">26</a>  For thou writest bitter things against me, and makest me to possess the iniquities of my youth.<br><a name="27">27</a>  Thou puttest my feet also in the stocks, and lookest narrowly unto all my paths; thou settest a print upon the heels of my feet.<br><a name="28">28</a>  And he, as a rotten thing, consumeth, as a garment that is moth eaten.<br><br>Go to <a href="job14.htm#1">Job 14</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
