<b><i>1:1 Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ, <br>to the strangers scattered throughout Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia,<br>
1:2 Elect according to the foreknowledge of God the Father, <br>through sanctification of the Spirit, unto obedience and sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ: <br>Grace unto you, and peace, be multiplied.</i></b></dt><dl>
<dt>Peter, an apostle...- Peter did not elevate himself above the other apostles (<a href="1pet5.htm#1">5:1</a>; <a href="2pet1.htm#1">2Pet 1:1</a>).
<dd>He does not emphasize his office. But he identifies himself as a changed man.The Lord Jesus Christ had changed him from unstable Simon {HB= hearing}, to Peter {GK= a stone} or Cephas {Aramaic= a stone}. cp. <a href="joh1.htm#41">Joh 1:41,42</a>; <a href="luk22.htm#31">Luk 22:31-34</a>
<dt>to the strangers scattered {GK=diaspora, lit., sown abroad}... elect...- cp. <a href="jam1.htm#1">Jam 1:1</a>
<ul><li>The Jewish people had been scattered into gentile lands, in fulfillment of God's promise to judge them if they turned from Him (cp. <a href="deu4.htm#25">Deu 4:25-27</a>). This dispersion away from the land of Israel was accomplished by the Syrian and Babylonian captivities (approx. 600 BC). Some of the people had returned to Israel in the time of Ezra and Nehemiah, but in the first century AD, many Jews still remained in the lands of their diaspora.<ul><li>Peter had set out to reach them. Peter's ministry was primarily directed toward the Jews, whereas Paul went primarily to the Gentiles. cp. <a href="gal2.htm#7">Gal 2:7-9</a>
<li>The five named locations are geographic regions of modern Turkey (<a href="1pet1.htm#1" target="lwr_lt">v.1</a>).<br>At Pentecost, Peter's message was heard by men from Pontus &amp; Cappadocia (<a href="act2.htm#6">Acts 2:6-9</a>).<br>The Holy Spirit prevented Paul from ministering in Bithynia. It may be that Peter's ministry had already reached that area (<a href="act16.htm#7">Acts 16:7</a>; cp. <a href="rom15.htm#20">Rom 15:20</a>).</ul>
<li>This letter was written from Babylon (<a href="1pet5.htm#13">5:13</a>). This may refer to Rome, in a spiritual sense (cp. <a href="rev17.htm#5">Rev 17:5</a>; <a href="rev18.htm#1">18:1,2</a>). However, geographic Babylon is suggested by the order in which the regions are addressed: generally from east to west, as though travelling from Babylon toward Rome (on a somewhat circuitous route). At this time, Babylon still had a large Jewish population. 
<li>Peter writes primarily to Jewish believers in Jesus Christ (but does not exclude gentile believers, cp. <a href="1pet2.htm#9">2:9,10</a>; <a href="1pet4.htm#1">4:1-4</a>). Many gentile believers had also been scattered, because of persecution (<a href="act8.htm#4">Acts 8:4</a>).</ul>
<dt>strangers {ie., pilgrims, sojourners, cp. <a href="heb11.htm#13">Heb 11:13</a>}... elect {ie., chosen}-
<dd>Peter's purpose is to encourage 'strangers' in the world, who are the 'chosen' of God.
<dd>He contrasts the <i>sufferings</i> of believers (cp. <a href="1pet1.htm#6" target="lwr_lt">v.6-7</a>; <a href="1pet2.htm#19">2:19-23</a>; <a href="1pet3.htm#9">3:9-10,14-18</a>; <a href="1pet4.htm#1">4:1-4,14</a>)<br>
with the <i>glory</i> that will follow (cp. <a href="1pet1.htm#7" target="lwr_lt">v.7,8,11,21</a>; <a href="1pet2.htm#12">2:12</a>; <a href="1pet4.htm#11">4:11-16</a>; <a href="1pet5.htm#1">5:1,4,10,11</a>).<br>
- - Beyond the suffering that his readers were already experiencing, he foresaw an intensification of persecution (<a href="1pet4.htm#12">4:12</a>), as the Roman government turned against Christians. Peter and Paul would both suffer martyrdom, under Nero, as this persecution began.<br>
Yet, because this world is not our home, he encouraged believers to live in <i>hope</i> (cp. <a href="1pet1.htm#3" target="lwr_lt">v.3,13</a>; <a href="1pet3.htm#15">3:15</a>), and to stand firm by God's <i>grace</i> (<a href="1pet5.htm#12">5:12</a>).<br>
- - This letter, written in obedience to Jesus' command to ''strengthen thy brethren'' (<a href="luk22.htm#32">Luk 22:32</a>), came from the heart of a man who had experience in the things about which he writes. He had been timid and fearful, but the Lord had made him bold. He had been imprisoned for the sake of Christ. Soon, he would suffer martyrdom by crucifixion.
<dt><b>The theme of this letter:</b> <i>'Christian Hope in the time of Trial'</i> [McGee]<dd>
- - The biblical term 'hope' means 'confidence' or 'sure expectation.' <br>- - (It is very different from 'hope so' uncertainty.) 
<dt>This hope is secured by all three Persons of the Godhead (<a href="1pet1.htm#2" target="lwr_lt">v.2</a>)-<ol type="1">
<li>elect according to the foreknowledge of <i>God, the Father</i>-<ul>
<li>elect- The chosen ones.  cp. <a href="mat22.htm#14">Mat 22:14</a>; <a href="joh6.htm#37">Joh 6:37</a>; <a href="joh3.htm#14">Joh 3:14-18</a><br>''His invitation to 'Whosoever will' is 'Come unto Me.'<br>It is a legitimate invitation to everyone, but there must be a response, and the response is your responsibility...'' [McGee]
<li>foreknowledge- God's plan for salvation was ready before the world was created. <br>He knew man would sin. He prepared the Way of salvation, in the Person of the Savior (<a href="1pet1.htm#20" target="lwr_lt">v.20</a>; <a href="act2.htm#23">Acts 2:23</a>). He knows who will trust Him (<a href="rom8.htm#29">Rom 8:29</a>; <a href="rom11.htm#2">11:2</a>).<br>[For a more complete discussion of Election, Foreknowledge and Predestination, see the <a href="eph_menu.htm" target="lwr_lt">Book Notes</a> at Ephesians 1:2-6.]</ul>
<li>through sanctification of <i>the Spirit</i>, unto obedience...-<br>
Believers are 'sanctified' or 'set apart' for God in two ways:<ol type="A">
<li>An objective Position (imparted holiness): God sees the believer as 'accepted in the beloved' through 'obedience' (or, submission) to His plan of salvation; ie., by faith in Christ, we belong in the family of God (<a href="1cor12.htm#13">1Cor 12:13</a>; <a href="eph1.htm#6">Eph 1:6,7</a>). The Holy Spirit calls us from unbelief to faith in Christ (<a href="2the2.htm#13">2The 2:13,14</a>).
<li>A subjective Process (progressive holiness): The Holy Spirit works within the individual believer to mature him in practical (day to day) obedience to God's will. cp. <a href="1pet1.htm#14" target="lwr_lt">v.14-16</a>; <a href="1pet1.htm#22" target="lwr_lt">v.22</a>; <a href="php2.htm#12">Php 2:12,13</a></ol>
<li>and sprinkling of the blood of <i>Jesus Christ</i>- The believer has been redeemed by the blood of Christ and accepted before God. But because he still lives in an impure world, and still struggles with his fleshly nature, cleansing from incidental sins is required, to remain in fellowship with God. This cleansing is also by Christ's blood. cp. <a href="1joh1.htm#6">1Joh 1:6-9</a>
<dd>(Each of the above points will be explained and expanded as the letter progresses.)</ol>
<dt>Grace... peace...- Because of God's grace, we can have peace in our hearts, even in troubled times.<br>&nbsp;

1:9 Receiving the end of your faith, [even] the salvation of [your] souls.</i></b> {cp. <a href="joh14.htm#1">Joh 14:1-3</a>; <a href="joh16.htm#22">16:22</a>; <a href="col3.htm#4">Col 3:4</a>}</dt><dl>
<dt>Blessed [be] {GK=eulogetos, praised}- This word is used only in reference to God.
<dt>the God &amp; Father of our Lord Jesus Christ- 
<dd>The Lord Jesus is the Son of God in a unique way. He is co-equal and co-eternal with the Father.
<dd>Believers are sons of God in a different sense. Only the eternal Son could accomplish the work of bringing many sons to glory (<a href="heb2.htm#10">Heb 2:10</a>; <a href="joh20.htm#17">Joh 20:17</a>).
<dt>who... hath begotten us again...- 
<dd>By nature we were not His sons. But by His grace, a new kind of life has sprung up within us.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This word for 'begotten again' {GK=anagennao} is used only twice in the NT (<a href="1pet1.htm#3" target="lwr_lt">v.3</a> and <a href="1pet1.htm#23" target="lwr_lt">v.23</a>). In other literature, this word is a botanical term referring to new plant life in the Spring season. Here, also it is associated with seed that has been sown (in <a href="1pet1.htm#1" target="lwr_lt">v.1</a> 'scattered' is GK= dia<i>spora</i>; in <a href="1pet1.htm#23" target="lwr_lt">v.23</a> 'seed' is GK= spora, cp. <a href="luk8.htm#11">Luk 8:11</a>).
<dt>unto a lively {ie., living} hope by the resurrection of Jesus Christ...- 
<dd>He, the seed, died for those dead in sins, to include them in His life. cp. <a href="joh12.htm#23">Joh 12:23,24</a>; <a href="rom6.htm#5">Rom 6:5</a>
<dd>The believer's confident expectation (of resurrection &amp; eternal life) is inseparably linked to Christ. Because He lives, we also live. <a href="col3.htm#3">Col 3:3,4</a>
<dt>to an inheritance...- <ul>
<li>incorruptible {or, immortal, indestructible}. <a href="1cor15.htm#53">1Cor 15:53,54</a>; cp. <a href="mat6.htm#19">Mat 6:19,20</a>
<li>undefiled {untainted by sin &amp; the world}. cp. <a href="heb7.htm#26">Heb 7:26</a>; <a href="rev21.htm#27">Rev 21:27</a>
<li>that fades not away {ie., not diminishing in value, like the stock of a crumbling corporation}. <br><a href="isa40.htm#7">Isa 40:7,8</a>; <a href="jam1.htm#11">Jam 1:11</a>; <a href="1pet5.htm#4">1Pet 5:4</a>
<li>reserved {ie., guarded} in heaven...-<br>Our inheritance (1) is protected by God, and<dd>(2) is located in heaven, not on earth. cp. <a href="col1.htm#5">Col 1:5</a></dd></ul>
<dt>for you, who are kept {ie., garrisoned}- <ul>
<li>by God- The One, who guards the inheritance, also guards the heirs.<br>God's power secures the believer -<dd>(1) against outside forces (cp. <a href="isa54.htm#17">Isa 54:17</a>; <a href="joh10.htm#27">Joh 10:27-30</a>), and</dd><dd>(2) against inward weakness &amp; inadequacy (<a href="jer32.htm#40">Jer 32:40</a>; <a href="php1.htm#6">Php 1:6</a>). cp. <a href="joh17.htm#11">Joh 17:11,15</a></dd>
<li>through faith (by which, we are linked to God. cp. <a href="1pet1.htm#21" target="lwr_lt">v.21</a>)
<li>unto salvation {which is} ready to be revealed... (cp. <a href="1pet1.htm#13" target="lwr_lt">v.13</a>; <a href="heb9.htm#28">Heb 9:28</a>)<br>Salvation is in three tenses:<ol type="1">
<li>The believer <i>has been saved</i> from the guilt and penalty of sin. eg., <a href="eph2.htm#5">Eph 2:5,8</a>; <a href="2tim1.htm#9">2Tim 1:9</a>
<li>The believer <i>is being saved</i> from the habit and dominion of sin. eg., <a href="php2.htm#12">Php 2:12,13</a>; <a href="2cor3.htm#18">2Cor 3:18</a>; <a href="gal2.htm#19">Gal 2:19,20</a>
<li>The believer <i>is to be saved</i> in the sense of entire conformity to Christ. eg., <a href="1pet1.htm#5" target="lwr_lt">v.5</a>; <a href="rom13.htm#11">Rom 13:11</a>; <a href="1joh3.htm#2">1Joh 3:2</a><dd> [adapted from ScofRB note at <a href="rom1.htm#16">Rom 1:16</a>]</dd><dt>When salvation is completed, everything will be brought into submission to God. <a href="1cor15.htm#21">1Cor 15:21-28</a></dt></ol></ul>
<dt>Secure in this salvation, the believer has joy, even in present suffering. 
<dd>The period of testing is temporary (<a href="1pet1.htm#6" target="lwr_lt">v.6</a>), and it has a beneficial purpose (<a href="1pet1.htm#7" target="lwr_lt">v.7</a>).
<dd>Read v.6-9 in the text above (with the cross reference links).<br>&nbsp;
</dl><dt>II. Suffering and the Scriptures - Produces Holiness (<a href="1pet1.htm#10" target="lwr_lt">1:10-25</a>)<dt><dt>
<b><i>1:10 Of which salvation the prophets have enquired and searched diligently, </b></i>{cp. <a href="jam5.htm#10">Jam 5:10</a>}<i><b><br>who prophesied of the grace [that should come] unto you:<br>
1:11 Searching what, or what manner of time the Spirit of Christ which was in them did signify, <br>when it testified beforehand the sufferings of Christ, and the glory that should follow.<br>
1:12 Unto whom it was revealed, that not unto themselves, <br>
but unto us they did minister the things, which are now reported unto you <br>by them that have preached the gospel unto you with the Holy Ghost sent down from heaven; <br>which things the angels desire to look into.</i></b></dt><dl>
<dt>The OT prophets, speaking by inspiration of the Holy Spirit (cp. <a href="2pet1.htm#21">2Pet 1:21</a>), 
<dd>could not reconcile the apparent conflict within the message they received concerning-<ol type="a">
<li>the sufferings of Christ. eg. <a href="isa53.htm">Isa 53</a>; <a href="psa22.htm">Psa 22</a>
<li>the glory [of Christ]. eg. <a href="isa11.htm">Isa 11</a>; <a href="psa45.htm">Psa 45</a><br>
For the OT prophets, both events were yet future. They did not understand that the two events would be separated by a period of time. The NT writers, living between these events, saw that Christ's sufferings were past, but His glory was yet to come.</ol>
<dt>The NT preachers, speaking by the power of the Holy Spirit (cp. <a href="joh16.htm#12">Joh 16:12-15</a>), 
<dd>now clearly proclaim the same message, the Gospel of salvation: <ol type="a">
<li>that Christ suffered, died and arose to make us His, and 
<li>that Christ is coming again to bring us into His glory.</ol>
<dd>Even so, our understanding of God's grace is incomplete, <br>
- - as evidenced by the fact that even the angels desire to understand these things. cp. <a href="eph3.htm#8">Eph 3:8-11</a><br>
- - which is reason for us to study what Scripture says about these things. <a href="2pet1.htm#19">2Pet 1:19-21</a>
</dl><dt>
<b><i>1:13 Wherefore gird up the loins of your mind, be sober </b></i>{ie., soberminded}<i><b>, <br>and hope to the end for the grace that is to be brought unto you at the revelation of Jesus Christ;<br>
1:14 As obedient children, <br>not fashioning yourselves according to the former lusts in your ignorance:<br>

<dd></i></b>{ie., ... in all aspects of your manner of life}<b><i><dt>
1:16 Because it is written, Be ye holy; for I am holy.</i></b></dt><dl>
<dt>The text of <a href="1pet1.htm#13" target="lwr_lt">v.13-25</a> is built around four imperitives...
<dd>Because of our secure salvation provided by God's Grace (described in <a href="1pet1.htm#3" target="lwr_lt">v.3-9</a>), and attested by the Holy Spirit through the prophets and the Scriptures (<a href="1pet1.htm#10" target="lwr_lt">v.10-12</a>), we are to- <ol type="1">
<li><b>hope</b> {lit., set your hope...} (<a href="1pet1.htm#13" target="lwr_lt">v.13</a>)-<dd>ie., live in confident expectation of the fulfillment of salvation (at Christ's return).<br>
Such expectancy motivates the believer to be (A) prepared and committed to the task at hand {'loins girded', cp. <a href="ex12.htm#11">Ex 12:11</a>; <a href="jer1.htm#17">Jer 1:17</a>; <a href="luk12.htm#35">Luk 12:35-37</a>}, and (B) serious {'soberminded'} about God's Word, and about His business.</dd>
<li><b>be holy</b> (<a href="1pet1.htm#15" target="lwr_lt">v.15</a>)- ie., not living in conformity to the old way of the world (<a href="1pet1.htm#14" target="lwr_lt">v.14</a>), <br>but living in conformity to Him (<a href="1pet1.htm#16" target="lwr_lt">v.16</a>; cp. <a href="rom12.htm#2">Rom 12:2</a>). We are to be 'separated' unto Him, as a 'chaste virgin' awaiting her Bridegroom (<a href="2cor11.htm#2">2Cor 11:2</a>).<br>''Holinesss is, to the spiritual life, what health is, to the physical life.'' [McGee]</ol>
</dl><dt>
<b><i>1:17 And if ye call on the Father, <br>

1:19 But with the precious blood of Christ, as of a lamb without blemish and without spot:<br>

1:24 For all flesh [is] as grass, and all the glory of man as the flower of grass. <br>The grass withereth, and the flower thereof falleth away:<br>
1:25 But the word of the Lord endureth for ever. </b></i>{quoted from <a href="isa40.htm#6">Isa 40:6-8</a>}<i><b><br>And this is the word which by the gospel is preached unto you.</i></b></dt><dl>
<dt>The four imperitives (continued)- <ol type="1" start="3" type="1">
<li><b>live in fear</b> (<a href="1pet1.htm#17" target="lwr_lt">v.17</a>) -
<br>In the KJV, the urgency of the verb is muted. The imperitive verb {GK= anastrepho, translated as 'pass'} means 'turn yourself about.' Our conduct or manner of life, must be governed according to a healthy fear {GK=phobos, fear, terror} of God. 
<br>God's children are to 'Live in reverential respect toward'-<ul>
<li>the Judge, in consideration of your accountability to Him. (<a href="1pet1.htm#17" target="lwr_lt">v.17</a>; <a href="rom14.htm#10">Rom 14:10-12</a>; <a href="2cor5.htm#9">2Cor 5:9-11</a>)
<li>the Redeemer, in consideration of the precious {ie., of great value} price which He paid for you. cp. <a href="1pet1.htm#18" target="lwr_lt">v.18-21</a>; <a href="luk12.htm#42">Luk 12:42-48</a><ol type="a">
<li>We had nothing with which to redeem ourselves (<a href="1pet1.htm#18" target="lwr_lt">v.18</a>).<br>
Our tangible wealth had no real or lasting value (cf. <a href="1pet1.htm#4" target="lwr_lt">v.4</a>; cp. <a href="psa49.htm#6">Psa 49:6-9</a>)<br>Our spiritual resources from human religion were vain {empty} (cf. <a href="1pet1.htm#3" target="lwr_lt">v.3</a>).<br>
<li>Christ redeemed us with His own blood, which is precious {ie., of great price} (<a href="1pet1.htm#19" target="lwr_lt">v.19</a>).<br>
'blood as of a lamb without blemish... without spot'... - cp. <a href="ex12.htm#5">Ex 12:5</a><br>
Peter was introduced to Jesus as the 'lamb of God' (<a href="joh1.htm#29">Joh 1:29,35-42</a>).<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After observing Him for 3 years, Peter and the other desciples were in a position to evaluate His suitability as the sacrificial lamb. cp. <a href="1pet2.htm#22">1Pet 2:22-24</a>; <a href="1joh1.htm#1">1Joh 1:1-3</a><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here again (as in <a href="1pet1.htm#2" target="lwr_lt">v.2</a>), we are reminded that our salvation is secured by all three Persons of the Godhead working together (see points b., c., d.). &quot;How shall we escape if we neglect {ie., are careless of, make light of} so great salvation...?&quot; (<a href="heb2.htm#3">Heb 2:3</a>)
<li>The Father 'foreordained' Christ for this purpose from eternity past (<a href="1pet1.htm#20" target="lwr_lt">v.20</a>).<dd>
'Foreordained' is a verb form of the word 'foreknowledge' in <a href="1pet1.htm#2" target="lwr_lt">v.2</a>.</dd>
<dd>He was made 'manifest' {ie., clearly revealed} in time (by His incarnation, death, resurrection and ascension into heaven).</dd>
<li>The Holy Spirit brought us to faith in God, and obedience to the Truth of the Gospel (<a href="1pet1.htm#21" target="lwr_lt">v.21,22</a>).</ol></ul>
<li><b>love</b> (<a href="1pet1.htm#22" target="lwr_lt">v.22</a>) - 
<dd>The imperative verb, rooted in the word 'agape,' enjoins the exercise of a kind of love that is willing to pay whatever price is necessary. 
This love is to be unpretended {unfeigned}, pure, and fervent {GK=ektenso, extended, stretched out}, toward the brethren (ie., the children of God, through the new birth). The phrase 'love of the brethren' is the GK word 'philadelphia.' cp. <a href="1joh4.htm#20">1Joh 4:20,21</a>; <a href="1joh5.htm#1">5:1</a></dd></ol>
<dt>These characteristics (to hope, to be holy, to fear God, to love) are not natural to man.
<dd>They result from the transforming power of God, which makes new life spring up within the believer (<a href="1pet1.htm#23" target="lwr_lt">v.23</a>). 'Born again' is GK=anagennao (the word used in <a href="1pet1.htm#3" target="lwr_lt">v.3</a>) referring to new life from the Seed which God has planted. The Seed is the Son and the Word (the Scriptures) which speak of Him (<a href="luk8.htm#11">Luk 8:11</a>; <a href="joh5.htm#39">Joh 5:39</a>; <a href="joh12.htm#23">12:23,24</a>).
