These [things are] the burden of the sons of Kohath in the tabernacle of the congregation.<br><a name="16">16</a>  And to the office of Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest [pertaineth] the oil for the light, and the sweet incense, and the daily meat offering, and the anointing oil, [and] the oversight of all the tabernacle, and of all that therein [is], in the sanctuary, and in the vessels thereof.<br><a name="17">17</a>  And the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying,<br><a name="18">18</a>  Cut ye not off the tribe of the families of the Kohathites from among the Levites:<br><a name="19">19</a>  But thus do unto them, that they may live, and not die, when they approach unto the most holy things: Aaron and his sons shall go in, and appoint them every one to his service and to his burden:<br><a name="20">20</a>  But they shall not go in to see when the holy things are covered, lest they die.<br><a name="21">21</a>.
