Psalms 125<br>1. A Song of degrees. They that trust in the LORD [shall be] as mount Zion, [which] cannot be removed, [but] abideth for ever.<br><a name="2">2</a>  As the mountains [are] round about Jerusalem, so the LORD [is] round about his people from henceforth even for ever.<br><a name="3">3</a>  For the rod of the wicked shall not rest upon the lot of the righteous; lest the righteous put forth their hands unto iniquity.<br><a name="4">4</a>. Do good, O LORD, unto [those that be] good, and [to them that are] upright in their hearts.<br><a name="5">5</a>  As for such as turn aside unto their crooked ways, the LORD shall lead them forth with the workers of iniquity: [but] peace [shall be] upon Israel.<br><br>Go to <a href="psa126.htm#1">Psalm 126</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
