Ecclesiastes   2<br>1. I said in mine heart, Go to now, I will prove thee with mirth, therefore enjoy pleasure: and, behold, this also [is] vanity.<br><a name="2">2</a>  I said of laughter, [It is] mad: and of mirth, What doeth it?<br><a name="3">3</a>  I sought in mine heart to give myself unto wine, yet acquainting mine heart with wisdom; and to lay hold on folly, till I might see what [was] that good for the sons of men, which they should do under the heaven all the days of their life.<br><a name="4">4</a>  I made me great works; I builded me houses; I planted me vineyards:<br><a name="5">5</a>  I made me gardens and orchards, and I planted trees in them of all [kind of] fruits:<br><a name="6">6</a>  I made me pools of water, to water therewith the wood that bringeth forth trees:<br><a name="7">7</a>  I got [me] servants and maidens, and had servants born in my house; also I had great possessions of great and small cattle above all that were in Jerusalem before me:<br><a name="8">8</a>  I gathered me also silver and gold, and the peculiar treasure of kings and of the provinces: I gat me men singers and women singers, and the delights of the sons of men, [as] musical instruments, and that of all sorts.<br><a name="9">9</a>  So I was great, and increased more than all that were before me in Jerusalem: also my wisdom remained with me.<br><a name="10">10</a>  And whatsoever mine eyes desired I kept not from them, I withheld not my heart from any joy; for my heart rejoiced in all my labour: and this was my portion of all my labour.<br><a name="11">11</a>  Then I looked on all the works that my hands had wrought, and on the labour that I had laboured to do: and, behold, all [was] vanity and vexation of spirit, and [there was] no profit under the sun.<br><a name="12">12</a>. And I turned myself to behold wisdom, and madness, and folly: for what [can] the man [do] that cometh after the king? [even] that which hath been already done.<br><a name="13">13</a>  Then I saw that wisdom excelleth folly, as far as light excelleth darkness.<br><a name="14">14</a>  The wise man's eyes [are] in his head; but the fool walketh in darkness: and I myself perceived also that one event happeneth to them all.<br><a name="15">15</a>  Then said I in my heart, As it happeneth to the fool, so it happeneth even to me; and why was I then more wise? Then I said in my heart, that this also [is] vanity.<br><a name="16">16</a>  For [there is] no remembrance of the wise more than of the fool for ever; seeing that which now [is] in the days to come shall all be forgotten. And how dieth the wise [man]? as the fool.<br><a name="17">17</a>. Therefore I hated life; because the work that is wrought under the sun [is] grievous unto me: for all [is] vanity and vexation of spirit.<br><a name="18">18</a>  Yea, I hated all my labour which I had taken under the sun: because I should leave it unto the man that shall be after me.<br><a name="19">19</a>  And who knoweth whether he shall be a wise [man] or a fool? yet shall he have rule over all my labour wherein I have laboured, and wherein I have shewed myself wise under the sun. This [is] also vanity.<br><a name="20">20</a>  Therefore I went about to cause my heart to despair of all the labour which I took under the sun.<br><a name="21">21</a>  For there is a man whose labour [is] in wisdom, and in knowledge, and in equity; yet to a man that hath not laboured therein shall he leave it [for] his portion. This also [is] vanity and a great evil.<br><a name="22">22</a>  For what hath man of all his labour, and of the vexation of his heart, wherein he hath laboured under the sun?<br><a name="23">23</a>  For all his days [are] sorrows, and his travail grief; yea, his heart taketh not rest in the night. This is also vanity.<br><a name="24">24</a>  [There is] nothing better for a man, [than] that he should eat and drink, and [that] he should make his soul enjoy good in his labour. This also I saw, that it [was] from the hand of God.<br><a name="25">25</a>  For who can eat, or who else can hasten [hereunto], more than I?<br><a name="26">26</a>  For [God] giveth to a man that [is] good in his sight wisdom, and knowledge, and joy: but to the sinner he giveth travail, to gather and to heap up, that he may give to [him that is] good before God. This also [is] vanity and vexation of spirit.<br><br>Go to <a href="ecc3.htm#1">Ecclesiastes 3</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
