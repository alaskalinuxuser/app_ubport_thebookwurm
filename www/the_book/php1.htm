Philippians   1<br> 1. Paul and Timotheus, the servants of Jesus Christ, to all the saints in Christ Jesus which are at Philippi, with the bishops and deacons:<br><a name="2">2</a>  Grace [be] unto you, and peace, from God our Father, and [from] the Lord Jesus Christ.<br><a name="3">3</a>. I thank my God upon every remembrance of you,<br><a name="4">4</a>  Always in every prayer of mine for you all making request with joy,<br><a name="5">5</a>  For your fellowship in the gospel from the first day until now;<br><a name="6">6</a>  Being confident of this very thing, that he which hath begun a good work in you will perform [it] until the day of Jesus Christ:<br><a name="7">7</a>. Even as it is meet for me to think this of you all, because I have you in my heart; inasmuch as both in my bonds, and in the defence and confirmation of the gospel, ye all are partakers of my grace.<br><a name="8">8</a>  For God is my record, how greatly I long after you all in the bowels of Jesus Christ.<br><a name="9">9</a>. And this I pray, that your love may abound yet more and more in knowledge and [in] all judgment;<br><a name="10">10</a>  That ye may approve things that are excellent; that ye may be sincere and without offence till the day of Christ;<br><a name="11">11</a>  Being filled with the fruits of righteousness, which are by Jesus Christ, unto the glory and praise of God.<br><a name="12">12</a>. But I would ye should understand, brethren, that the things [which happened] unto me have fallen out rather unto the furtherance of the gospel;<br><a name="13">13</a>  So that my bonds in Christ are manifest in all the palace, and in all other [places];<br><a name="14">14</a>  And many of the brethren in the Lord, waxing confident by my bonds, are much more bold to speak the word without fear.<br><a name="15">15</a>  Some indeed preach Christ even of envy and strife; and some also of good will:<br><a name="16">16</a>  The one preach Christ of contention, not sincerely, supposing to add affliction to my bonds:<br><a name="17">17</a>  But the other of love, knowing that I am set for the defence of the gospel.<br><a name="18">18</a>  What then? notwithstanding, every way, whether in pretence, or in truth, Christ is preached; and I therein do rejoice, yea, and will rejoice.<br><a name="19">19</a>  For I know that this shall turn to my salvation through your prayer, and the supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ,<br><a name="20">20</a>  According to my earnest expectation and [my] hope, that in nothing I shall be ashamed, but [that] with all boldness, as always, [so] now also Christ shall be magnified in my body, whether [it be] by life, or by death.<br><a name="21">21</a>. For to me to live [is] Christ, and to die [is] gain.<br><a name="22">22</a>  But if I live in the flesh, this [is] the fruit of my labour: yet what I shall choose I wot not.<br><a name="23">23</a>  For I am in a strait betwixt two, having a desire to depart, and to be with Christ; which is far better:<br><a name="24">24</a>  Nevertheless to abide in the flesh [is] more needful for you.<br><a name="25">25</a>  And having this confidence, I know that I shall abide and continue with you all for your furtherance and joy of faith;<br><a name="26">26</a>  That your rejoicing may be more abundant in Jesus Christ for me by my coming to you again.<br><a name="27">27</a>. Only let your conversation be as it becometh the gospel of Christ: that whether I come and see you, or else be absent, I may hear of your affairs, that ye stand fast in one spirit, with one mind striving together for the faith of the gospel;<br><a name="28">28</a>  And in nothing terrified by your adversaries: which is to them an evident token of perdition, but to you of salvation, and that of God.<br><a name="29">29</a>  For unto you it is given in the behalf of Christ, not only to believe on him, but also to suffer for his sake;<br><a name="30">30</a>  Having the same conflict which ye saw in me, and now hear [to be] in me.<br><br>Go to <A HREF="php2.htm#1">Philippians 2</A><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
