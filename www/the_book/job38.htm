Job  38<br>1. Then the LORD answered Job out of the whirlwind, and said,<br><a name="2">2</a>  Who [is] this that darkeneth counsel by words without knowledge?<br><a name="3">3</a>  Gird up now thy loins like a man; for I will demand of thee, and answer thou me.<br><a name="4">4</a>. Where wast thou when I laid the foundations of the earth? declare, if thou hast understanding.<br><a name="5">5</a>  Who hath laid the measures thereof, if thou knowest? or who hath stretched the line upon it?<br><a name="6">6</a>  Whereupon are the foundations thereof fastened? or who laid the corner stone thereof;<br><a name="7">7</a>  When the morning stars sang together, and all the sons of God shouted for joy?<br><a name="8">8</a>  Or [who] shut up the sea with doors, when it brake forth, [as if] it had issued out of the womb?<br><a name="9">9</a>  When I made the cloud the garment thereof, and thick darkness a swaddlingband for it,<br><a name="10">10</a>  And brake up for it my decreed [place], and set bars and doors,<br><a name="11">11</a>  And said, Hitherto shalt thou come, but no further: and here shall thy proud waves be stayed?<br><a name="12">12</a>. Hast thou commanded the morning since thy days; [and] caused the dayspring to know his place;<br><a name="13">13</a>  That it might take hold of the ends of the earth, that the wicked might be shaken out of it?<br><a name="14">14</a>  It is turned as clay [to] the seal; and they stand as a garment.<br><a name="15">15</a>  And from the wicked their light is withholden, and the high arm shall be broken.<br><a name="16">16</a>  Hast thou entered into the springs of the sea? or hast thou walked in the search of the depth?<br><a name="17">17</a>  Have the gates of death been opened unto thee? or hast thou seen the doors of the shadow of death?<br><a name="18">18</a>  Hast thou perceived the breadth of the earth? declare if thou knowest it all.<br><a name="19">19</a>  Where [is] the way [where] light dwelleth? and [as for] darkness, where [is] the place thereof,<br><a name="20">20</a>  That thou shouldest take it to the bound thereof, and that thou shouldest know the paths [to] the house thereof?<br><a name="21">21</a>  Knowest thou [it], because thou wast then born? or [because] the number of thy days [is] great?<br><a name="22">22</a>  Hast thou entered into the treasures of the snow? or hast thou seen the treasures of the hail,<br><a name="23">23</a>  Which I have reserved against the time of trouble, against the day of battle and war?<br><a name="24">24</a>  By what way is the light parted, [which] scattereth the east wind upon the earth?<br><a name="25">25</a>. Who hath divided a watercourse for the overflowing of waters, or a way for the lightning of thunder;<br><a name="26">26</a>  To cause it to rain on the earth, [where] no man [is; on] the wilderness, wherein [there is] no man;<br><a name="27">27</a>  To satisfy the desolate and waste [ground]; and to cause the bud of the tender herb to spring forth?<br><a name="28">28</a>  Hath the rain a father? or who hath begotten the drops of dew?<br><a name="29">29</a>  Out of whose womb came the ice? and the hoary frost of heaven, who hath gendered it?<br><a name="30">30</a>  The waters are hid as [with] a stone, and the face of the deep is frozen.<br><a name="31">31</a>  Canst thou bind the sweet influences of Pleiades, or loose the bands of Orion?<br><a name="32">32</a>  Canst thou bring forth Mazzaroth in his season? or canst thou guide Arcturus with his sons?<br><a name="33">33</a>  Knowest thou the ordinances of heaven? canst thou set the dominion thereof in the earth?<br><a name="34">34</a>  Canst thou lift up thy voice to the clouds, that abundance of waters may cover thee?<br><a name="35">35</a>  Canst thou send lightnings, that they may go, and say unto thee, Here we [are]?<br><a name="36">36</a>  Who hath put wisdom in the inward parts? or who hath given understanding to the heart?<br><a name="37">37</a>  Who can number the clouds in wisdom? or who can stay the bottles of heaven,<br><a name="38">38</a>  When the dust groweth into hardness, and the clods cleave fast together?<br><a name="39">39</a>  Wilt thou hunt the prey for the lion? or fill the appetite of the young lions,<br><a name="40">40</a>  When they couch in [their] dens, [and] abide in the covert to lie in wait?<br><a name="41">41</a>  Who provideth for the raven his food? when his young ones cry unto God, they wander for lack of meat.<br><br>Go to <a href="job39.htm#1">Job 39</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
