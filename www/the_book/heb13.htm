Let brotherly love continue.<br><a name="2">2</a>  Be not forgetful to entertain strangers: for thereby some have entertained angels unawares.<br><a name="3">3</a>  Remember them that are in bonds, as bound with them; [and] them which suffer adversity, as being yourselves also in the body.<br><a name="4">4</a>  Marriage [is] honourable in all, and the bed undefiled: but whoremongers and adulterers God will judge.<br><a name="5">5</a>  [Let your] conversation [be] without covetousness; [and be] content with such things as ye have: for he hath said, I will never leave thee, nor forsake thee.<br><a name="6">6</a>  So that we may boldly say, The Lord [is] my helper, and I will not fear what man shall do unto me.<br><a name="7">7</a>  Remember them which have the rule over you, who have spoken unto you the word of God: whose faith follow, considering the end of [their] conversation.<br> <a name="8"></a>8  Jesus Christ the same yesterday, and to day, and for ever.<br><a name="9">9</a>  Be not carried about with divers and strange doctrines. For [it is] a good thing that the heart be established with grace; not with meats, which have not profited them that have been occupied therein.<br><a name="10">10</a>  We have an altar, whereof they have no right to eat which serve the tabernacle.<br><a name="11">11</a>  For the bodies of those beasts, whose blood is brought into the sanctuary by the high priest for sin, are burned without the camp.<br><a name="12">12</a>  Wherefore Jesus also, that he might sanctify the people with his own blood, suffered without the gate.<br><a name="13">13</a>  Let us go forth therefore unto him without the camp, bearing his reproach.<br><a name="14">14</a>  For here have we no continuing city, but we seek one to come.<br><a name="15">15</a>  By him therefore let us offer the sacrifice of praise to God continually, that is, the fruit of [our] lips giving thanks to his name.<br><a name="16">16</a>  But to do good and to communicate forget not: for with such sacrifices God is well pleased.<br><a name="17">17</a>  Obey them that have the rule over you, and submit yourselves: for they watch for your souls, as they that must give account, that they may do it with joy, and not with grief: for that [is] unprofitable for you.<br><a name="18">18</a>. Pray for us: for we trust we have a good conscience, in all things willing to live honestly.<br><a name="19">19</a>  But I beseech [you] the rather to do this, that I may be restored to you the sooner.<br><a name="20">20</a>  Now the God of peace, that brought again from the dead our Lord Jesus, that great shepherd of the sheep, through the blood of the everlasting covenant,<br><a name="21">21</a>  Make you perfect in every good work to do his will, working in you that which is wellpleasing in his sight, through Jesus Christ; to whom [be] glory for ever and ever. Amen.<br><a name="22">22</a>  And I beseech you, brethren, suffer the word of exhortation: for I have written a letter unto you in few words.<br><a name="23">23</a>  Know ye that [our] brother Timothy is set at liberty; with whom, if he come shortly, I will see you.<br><a name="24">24</a>  Salute all them that have the rule over you, and all the saints. They of Italy salute you.<br><a name="25">25</a>  Grace [be] with you all. Amen.<br><br>End of Hebrews.<br>Go to <a href="jam1.htm#1">James 1</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
