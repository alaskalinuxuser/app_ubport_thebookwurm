<b><a href="psa22.htm#1" target="lwr_lt">PSALM 22</a> - The Crucifixion of the Messiah</b><br><dl>
<dt>Psalms 22, 23, 24 are<i> Psalms of the Shepherd</i>: 
<dd><a href="psa22.htm#1" target="lwr_lt">Psa 22</a> -The Good Shepherd who gives His life for the sheep. (<a href="joh10.htm#11">Joh 10:11</a>)
<dd><a href="psa23.htm#1">Psa 23</a> -The Great Shepherd, alive from the dead, cares for His sheep. (<a href="heb13.htm#20">Heb 13:20,21</a>) 
<dd><a href="psa24.htm#1">Psa 24</a> -The Chief Shepherd, King of Glory, rewards His sheep. (<a href="1pet5.htm#4">1Pet 5:4</a>)<dt>&nbsp;
<dt><i><b>22:1 To the chief Musician upon Aijeleth Shahar, A Psalm of David. </b></i></dt><dl>
<dt>Aijeleth (HB)= deer, hart;  Shahar (HB)= morning, dawn 
<dd>The title is obscure, supposed by some to be a musical notation.<ul>
<li>Some understand these words to be figurative of &quot;the Dawning of the Morning.&quot;<br>At the end of the dark night of His death, we get a fleeting glimpse of the Son in His resurrection, the Son whose Day of earthly glory is yet to come. <a href="2pet1.htm#19">2Pet 1:19</a>
<li>Others, apply &quot;the Deer of the Morning&quot; (the literal meaning of the Hebrew words),<br>to the Lord Jesus Christ, who though hunted like a deer and killed, yet lives, and comes &quot;skipping upon the mountains&quot; to His beloved (the Church). cp. <a href="song2.htm#8">Song 2:8,9</a></ul>
There is no conflict between these suggested meanings, for both are true.
<dt>This Psalm gives us the most detailed description of Christ's crucifixion in all 
<dd>of Scripture. Yet, this account was written about 1,000 years before the event. 
<dt>Here we are allowed to hear the inner agonies of our Lord upon the cross. 
<dd>This is holy ground. The soul, who desires to truly know the Savior, will do well to commune with Him concerning His heart desires expressed here. For, rather than observing Him in His sorrows from a distance, we are invited to join Him on the cross - that we might &quot;know Him... and the fellowship of His sufferings, being made conformable to His death...&quot; (<a href="php3.htm#10">Php 3:10</a>). We need to learn of Him what it means to be &quot;crucified with Christ...&quot; (<a href="gal2.htm#20">Gal 2:20</a>).<br>
<dt>Psalm 22 may be divided into two sections:
<dd>A. His cry for help, vs.1-21<dd> B. His praise for God's provision, vs.22-31</dl><dt>&nbsp;
<dt><i><b>My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me? </b></i></dt><dl>
<dt><b>&lt; 1 &gt;</b> The NT records seven sayings of Christ from the cross.
<dd>All 7 can be found in this Psalm. They are marked in &lt;brackets&gt; as they occur. 
<dd><a href="mat27.htm#46">&quot;Mat 27:46&quot;</a> (NT quotes of the Psalm are marked in quotation marks.) 
<dt>my God- HB= Eli - {the first person possessive form of the name El}
<dd>'El' is the 'the Mighty God who is able to deliver.'
<dd>For the One who cries out, He is more than that. He is 'My God.' 
<dt>why hast Thou forsaken me? - His soul is torn in unbearable agony.
<dd>It has taken place. The dreaded cup is no longer anticipated. 
<dd>To be rejected by men would be bearable. (cp. <a href="psa2.htm#1">Psa 2</a>).  But... 
<dt>Thou...- the One with whom I have always been One, apart from whom I have done nothing... 
<dd>(cp. <a href="joh8.htm#28">Joh 8:28</a>; <a href="joh10.htm#30">Joh 10:30</a>; <a href="joh17.htm#11">Joh 17:11,21</a>)</dl>
<dt><i><b>[why art thou so] far from helping me, [and from] the words of my roaring? </b></i></dt><dl>
<dt>helping- HB &quot;yeshua&quot;, to deliver, the word from which Jesus' name is derived. 
<dt>roaring- a cry of desperation --<dd>-- as of a deer brought down by wolves -- expressing agony beyond words. 
<dd>-- a wail of unutterable woe as our sins pressed down upon Him. [McGee] <a href="isa53.htm#6">Isa 53:6</a></dl> 
<dt><i><b>22:2 O my God, I cry in the daytime, but thou hearest not; </b></i></dt><dl>
<dt>you hear not- cf. &quot;...I know that you always hear me.&quot; (<a href="joh11.htm#42">Joh 11:42</a>)<dd>The One, whose prayer the Father always hears, finds Himself cut off. cp. <a href="psa20.htm#1">Psa 20</a>; <a href="psa21.htm#2">21:2,4</a></dl><dt>
<i><b>and in the night season, and am not silent. </b></i></dt><dl>
<dt>the night season - &quot;from the sixth... to the ninth hour... darkness...&quot; <a href="mat27.htm#45">Mat 27:45</a>
<dt>am not silent - 'Though cut off, I refuse to faint in prayer, or fail in faith toward You.'<dd>The opening words of this Psalm show us what was on the lips of our Savior as He died. While others railed at their fate, Jesus prayed through the Psalms. Through hearing the Word of God which spoke of Him, one of those who were crucified with Him came to recognize Him as the King. (<a href="luk23.htm#39">Luke 23:39-43</a>)</dl>
<dt><i><b>22:3 But thou [art] holy, [O thou] that inhabitest the praises of Israel.</b></i> </dt><dl>
<dt>Despite your silence toward me, I know that You remain righteous &amp; praiseworthy. 
<dd>There is no fault in You to cause unanswered prayer... 
<dt>thou art Holy...- Sin has separated between me and my God.
<dd><a href="isa59.htm#1">Isa 59:1,2</a>; <a href="2cor5.htm#21">2Cor 5:21</a> (The &quot;Why&quot; of vs.1 is answered.)</dl>
<dt><b><i>22:4 Our fathers trusted in thee:<br>
they trusted, and thou didst deliver them. </b></i></dt><dl>
<dt>our fathers - ie., the patriarchs of Israel, men of faith whose lives are examples to us. cp. <a href="psa99.htm#6">Psa 99:6</a></dl>
<dt><b><i>22:5 They cried unto thee, and were delivered:<br>
they trusted in thee, and were not confounded.</b></i> </dt><dl>
<dt>they trusted (3x)- 'I also trust.' (<a href="psa21.htm#7">Psa 21:7</a>)
<dt>they cried- 'As I do now.'
<dt>they were delivered (2x)- 'Is there no deliverance for me?'
<dt>they were not confounded (disappointed, ashamed)-<dd>'Is there no refuge, no hope for me?'</dl>
<dt><i><b>22:6 But I [am] a worm, and no man;</b></i> </dt><dl>
<dt>worm- an inconsequential creature, without strength, crushed and suffering without pity.<ul>
<li>Humbled to become a little lower than angels (as a man),<br>He humbled Himself yet further, even unto death. <a href="heb2.htm#9">Heb 2:9(a)</a>; <a href="php2.htm#5">Php 2:5-8</a>
<li>The HB refers to a specific type of worm, coccus ilicis, which was crushed to 
<br>create scarlet dye used to prepare the Tabernacle curtains. Inconsequential?</ul></dl> 
<dt><i><b>a reproach of men, and despised of the people. </b></i></dt><dl>
<dt>reproach- the object of men's scorn, cp. <a href="psa69.htm#12">Psa 69:12</a> 
<dt>despised- cp. <a href="isa53.htm#3">Isa 53:3</a></dl>
<dt><i><b>22:7 All they that see me laugh me to scorn: </b></i></dt><dl>
<dt>cp. <a href="psa22.htm#7" target="lwr_lt">v.7,8</a> with <a href="mat27.htm#39">&quot;Mat 27:39-44&quot;</a>
<dt>&quot;Which shall we wonder at most: the cruelty of man, or the love of the bleeding Savior?&quot; [CHS]
<dd>Of the 5 types of mockery in Mat 27, only the bitterest is recorded here. </dl>
<dt><i><b>they shoot out the lip, they shake the head, [saying],<br>
22:8 He trusted on the LORD [that] he would deliver him:<br>
let him deliver him, seeing he delighted in him. </b></i></dt><dl>
<dt>He trusted on...- lit., &quot; He rolled himself upon...&quot;- Even His enemies attest to His faith. 
<dd>But hear the biting sarcasm and hatred in their voices.<br>It was at this point that Jesus said:
<dt><b>&lt; 2 &gt;</b> &quot;Father, forgive them; they know not what they do.&quot; <a href="luk23.htm#33">Luk 23:33,34</a></dl>
<dt><b><i>
22:9 But thou [art] he that took me out of the womb:<br>
thou didst make me hope [when I was] upon my mother's breasts.</b></i> </dt><dl>
<dt>'Despite their mockery, the reality is that You are and have always been my God.'<dd>His relationship to God was unique, unlike that of any other man, for, through the virgin birth, He was the only begotten of the Father. <a href="luk1.htm#30">Luk 1:30-35</a></dl>
<dt><b><i>
22:10 I was cast upon thee from the womb:<br>
thou [art] my God from my mother's belly.</b></i> </dt><dl>
<dt>cast...- HB: thrown, hurled.<dd>'Trusted ('rolled upon', v.8) does not adequately express my dependence upon You.'
<dd>'You have brought me through untold hazards from birth to the present. Do not fail me now.'

<dt><i><b>22:11 Be not far from me; </b></i></dt><dl>
<dt>His greatest woe: that God had forsaken Him.<dd> His greatest plea: that He would be near. </dl>
<dt><i><b>for trouble [is] near;</b></i> </dt><dl>
<dt>The basis of His appeal: <ol type="a"><li>His relationship to God. <a href="psa22.htm#1" target="lwr_lt">vs.1-10</a><ol type="1"><li>His covenant relationship, through the fathers of Israel (v.4,5).<li>His close personal relationship to &quot;my God&quot; (vs. 1,2).<li>His uniquely intimate relationship, as the only begotten of the Father (v.9,10).</ol>
<li>The violence of His enemies. <a href="psa22.htm#11" target="lwr_lt">vs.11-21</a></ol></dl><dt>
<i><b>for [there is] none to help.</b></i></dt><dl>
<dt>His disciples forsook Him and fled. But even if near, they could not help.

<dt><b><i>
22:12 Many bulls have compassed </b></i>{ie., surrounded}<i><b> me:<br>
strong [bulls] of Bashan have beset me round. </b></i></dt><dl>
<dt>bulls- ie., the headstrong and violent.
<dt>Bashan- a breed known for strength, from a fertile region (<a href="deu32.htm#14">Deut 32:14</a>; <a href="num32.htm#4">Num 32:4,33</a>) 
<dd>&quot;Here is a picture of the leaders in positions of strength. Having sought for and obtained His blood, they still seek to gore their helpless victim with their cruelties.&quot; [CHS]<br>They had taken counsel together to destroy Him. Now, they gather around to watch and mock Him.

<dt><b><i>22:14 I am poured out like water, and all my bones are out of joint:<br>

<dt><a href="psa22.htm#14" target="lwr_lt">vs. 14-18</a> are a graphic description of death by crucifixion.<dd>Remarkably, execution by crucifixion was a Roman (not Jewish) practice, which was introduced hundreds of years after David wrote this Psalm. 
<dt>I am poured out - ie., utterly spent, emptied, wasted.
<dd>A man dying by crucifixion would exhaust his strength, due to the strenuous process of breathing, which required the continual raising of the body, in spite of pain and blood loss.
<dt>my bones... out of joint - the body stretched &amp; jarred as the cross was dropped into position.
<dt>my heart -- the physical organ stressed beyond its ability by pain &amp; shortness of breath.
<dd>-- the heartbreak of rejection by His people &amp; by His God. 
<dd>&quot;Who can endure the heat of God's wrath, if the the heart of Christ melted at it?&quot; [CHS] </dl>
<dt><b><i>
22:15 My strength is dried up like a potsherd </b></i>{ie., like a fragment of a broken clay pot}<i><b>;<br>

<dt>dried up...- He experienced severe dehydration,
<dd>from blood loss and perspiration due to suffering and sun exposure.<br>He saw His life ebbing away.

<dt>unicorns - or, 'wild oxen,' refers to a now extinct but particularly powerful and vicious beast.<dd>Their 'horns' refer to their destructive power.<dd>Christ's enemies were powerful and intent upon His destruction.

Christ died our death, so that we might not perish (<a href="psa22.htm#15" target="lwr_lt">v.15</a>; <a href="joh3.htm#16">Joh 3:16</a>; <a href="joh6.htm#50">6:50</a>).<br>
But His eternal life belongs only to those who are identified with Him, because they trust in Him. <a href="rom6.htm#23">Rom 6:23</a>; <a href="joh3.htm#36">Joh 3:36</a>; <a href="1joh5.htm#11">1Joh 5:11,12</a>
<dt>all... shall bow- every creature, saved &amp; lost, will acknowledge Jesus Christ as Lord.
