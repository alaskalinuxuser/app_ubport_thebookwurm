Romans  13<br> 1. Let every soul be subject unto the higher powers. For there is no power but of God: the powers that be are ordained of God.<br><a name="2">2</a>  Whosoever therefore resisteth the power, resisteth the ordinance of God: and they that resist shall receive to themselves damnation.<br><a name="3">3</a>  For rulers are not a terror to good works, but to the evil. Wilt thou then not be afraid of the power? do that which is good, and thou shalt have praise of the same:<br><a name="4">4</a>  For he is the minister of God to thee for good. But if thou do that which is evil, be afraid; for he beareth not the sword in vain: for he is the minister of God, a revenger to [execute] wrath upon him that doeth evil.<br><a name="5">5</a>  Wherefore [ye] must needs be subject, not only for wrath, but also for conscience sake.<br><a name="6">6</a>  For for this cause pay ye tribute also: for they are God's ministers, attending continually upon this very thing.<br><a name="7">7</a>. Render therefore to all their dues: tribute to whom tribute [is due]; custom to whom custom; fear to whom fear; honour to whom honour.<br><a name="8">8</a>  Owe no man any thing, but to love one another: for he that loveth another hath fulfilled the law.<br><a name="9">9</a>  For this, Thou shalt not commit adultery, Thou shalt not kill, Thou shalt not steal, Thou shalt not bear false witness, Thou shalt not covet; and if [there be] any other commandment, it is briefly comprehended in this saying, namely, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.<br><a name="10">10</a>  Love worketh no ill to his neighbour: therefore love [is] the fulfilling of the law.<br><a name="11">11</a>. And that, knowing the time, that now [it is] high time to awake out of sleep: for now [is] our salvation nearer than when we believed.<br><a name="12">12</a>  The night is far spent, the day is at hand: let us therefore cast off the works of darkness, and let us put on the armour of light.<br><a name="13">13</a>  Let us walk honestly, as in the day; not in rioting and drunkenness, not in chambering and wantonness, not in strife and envying.<br><a name="14">14</a>  But put ye on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make not provision for the flesh, to [fulfil] the lusts [thereof].<br><br>Go to <a href="rom14.htm#1">Romans 14</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
