<dl><dt>We are nearing the end of Chapters 30-33, in which the Lord shines a bright ray of hope into the midst of the dark days of the final siege of Jerusalem. Jeremiah is in prison. Nebuchadnezzar's armies surround Jerusalem and are making steady progress toward their inevitable conquest of the city. Now that the promised judgment is certain, and all human hope of avoiding it has vanished, the Lord says that just as surely as His promises of judgment have been fulfilled, so, His promises to restore are certain (<a href="jer32.htm#42">32:42</a>). Before we look at ch. 33, here is a brief summary of these four chapters:<dd><ol type="1">
<li>The coming Great Tribulation: the Time of Jacob's Trouble<br>&quot;But he shall be saved out of it.&quot; (<a href="jer30.htm#1">ch. 30</a>)
<li>The coming complete Renewal of Israel & Judah:<br>&quot;Behold, the days come that<b> I Will </b>. . . &quot; (<a href="jer31.htm#1">ch. 31</a>)<ol type="a">
<li>...bring again the captivity
<li>...be their God... they shall be my people
<li>...make a new covenant... write my laws in their hearts
<li>...establish them in their land... and in their city.</ol>
<li>The future Restoration is Certain,<br>as illustrated by Jeremiah's Purchase of Hanameel's Real Estate. (<a href="jer32.htm#1">ch. 32</a>)
<li>The future Restoration is Secured, by God's Covenants<br>to be fulfilled in the Person of David's Righteous Branch. (ch. 33)</ol><br>
<dt><b>The Security of the Kingdom of David,</b> ch. 33<dd>&quot;The chapter contains three sections, each section being, in its turn, constructed in triplets.&quot; [GWms]<br>The major points (Roman numerals and Letters) of the outline below are from George Williams (GWms).<br>
<dt>I. The Promise of Jehovah, <a href="jer33.htm#1" target="lwr_lt">33:1-14</a><ol type="A">
<li>Desolated Jerusalem, <a href="jer33.htm#1" target="lwr_lt">v.1-5</a><ul>
<li>Background:
<dd>Verses 4,5 describe the imminent destruction of Jerusalem.<ul>
<li>The defenders of the city were demolishing houses within the city to improve their fortifications.<br>(In v.4, read &quot;by&quot; as &quot;by reason of&quot; or &quot;on account of.&quot;)
<li>The armies outside were building ramps to surmount the walls.
<li>The houses intended for defence would be filled with the bodies of the defenders because their destruction was according to the Lord's purpose in judgment.</ul>
<dd>Against this backdrop, the Lord instructs Jeremiah (and the believing remnant):<ul>
<li>Call upon Me... - as opposed to calling upon false gods and political allies which had failed them.
<li>I will answer thee... - cp. <a href="jer29.htm#11">Jer 29:11-14</a>
<li>I will show thee great and mighty things which thou knowest not.
<dd>great - ie., large, overwhelming, powerful things - cp. <a href="eph3.htm#20">Eph 3:20</a><br>
mighty - lit., fortified; ie., inaccessible, secret things, which could not be known unless the Lord revealed and performed them. (This word is trans. &quot;withheld&quot; in <a href="job42.htm#2">Job 42:2</a>), cp. <a href="mat13.htm#34">Mat 13:34,35</a>; <a href="1cor2.htm#7">1Cor 2:7-11</a>; <a href="joh16.htm#12">Joh 16:12,13</a>.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though Jeremiah struggles to imagine a time of restoration, due to the pressing realities of the present destruction (cp. <a href="jer32.htm#24">Jer 32:24,25</a>), he is instructed to place his confidence in the Lord. The Lord identifies Himself (<a href="jer33.htm#2" target="lwr_lt">v.2</a>) as the &quot;maker&quot; {ie., doer, accomplisher, worker} of His purposes (cp. this word in <a href="jer33.htm#9" target="lwr_lt">v.9</a> &quot;I do... I procure,&quot; and <a href="jer33.htm#15" target="lwr_lt">v.15</a> &quot;execute&quot;).  It is He, the LORD, the everliving One, who has &quot;formed&quot; and &quot;established&quot; Jerusalem and the nation of Israel (cp. <a href="jer31.htm#35">31:35,36</a>; <a href="isa43.htm#1">Isa 43:1,21</a>; <a href="heb11.htm#10">Heb 11:10,16</a>). It is He who will ensure that Jerusalem is...</ul>
<li>Healed, <a href="jer33.htm#6" target="lwr_lt">v.6</a><ul>
<li>The incurable will be cured. <a href="jer30.htm#12">Jer 30:12-17</a>
<li>Peace and truth, hidden from them now, will be opened to them then. <a href="mic5.htm#5">Mic 5:5</a>; <a href="joh14.htm#6">Joh 14:6,27</a></ul>
<li>Restored &quot;as at the first,&quot; <a href="jer33.htm#7" target="lwr_lt">v.7-9</a>; cp. <a href="eze11.htm#17">Eze 11:17-19</a>; <a href="eze36.htm#16">36:16-38</a></ul>
<li>Desolated Towns, <a href="jer33.htm#10" target="lwr_lt">v.10</a> (cp. <a href="jer7.htm#34">Jer 7:34</a>; <a href="jer16.htm#9">16:9</a>; <a href="jer25.htm#10">25:10,11</a>)<ul>
<li>Gladdened, <a href="jer33.htm#11" target="lwr_lt">v.11a</a>
<li>Restored &quot;as at the first,&quot; v.11b</ul>
<li>Desolated Land, <a href="jer33.htm#12" target="lwr_lt">v.12a</a><ul>
<li>Enriched, v.12b,13
<li>Restored as promised, <a href="jer33.htm#14" target="lwr_lt">v.14</a><dd>The promises of restoration, in the preceeding verses, were only partially fulfilled during the return of the captivity under Ezra and Nehemiah. However, that restoration would mark the beginning of &quot;that good thing which I have promised&quot; ie., the ultimate and permanent restoration (cp. <a href="jer32.htm#37">32:37-42</a>).</ul></ol>
<dt>II. The Branch of Jehovah, <a href="jer33.htm#15" target="lwr_lt">v.15-18</a><ul><li>Note that His coming is in two stages:<ol type="1">
<li>in those days, and at that time (v.15a) - ie., during the period of partial restoration,<br>I will cause the Branch of Righteousness to grow up {to sprout, to spring up} unto David -  <a href="isa11.htm#1">Isa 11:1</a>; cp. <a href="jer33.htm#12" target="lwr_lt">v.12,15a</a> with <a href="luk2.htm#1">Luk 2:1,6,8,11</a>
<li>in those days (v.16) - ie., the days of His reign, as described in v.15b,<br>Judah shall be saved, and Jerusalem shall dwell safely. cp. <a href="jer30.htm#10">30:10,11</a></ol></ul><ol type="A">
<li>as Jehovah, <a href="jer33.htm#16" target="lwr_lt">v.16</a><dd>The LORD our righteousness - cp. <a href="isa45.htm#24">Isa 45:24,25</a>; <a href="1cor1.htm#30">1Cor 1:30</a>; <a href="2cor5.htm#21">2Cor 5:21</a>; <a href="php3.htm#9">Php 3:9</a>; <a href="2pet1.htm#1">2Pet 1:1</a><br>This name is applied to the Messiah, the Savior, in <a href="jer23.htm#6">Jer 23:6</a>. But here, it is this name whereby she (ie., Jerusalem) shall be called. That is, His name is applied to her, as the bridegroom's name is given to his bride.
<li>as King, <a href="jer33.htm#17" target="lwr_lt">v.17</a><dd>Today, while no king sits upon the throne of the house of Israel (<a href="hos3.htm#4">Hos 3:4</a>), David does not lack a man for that throne. Until the time appointed for His earthly reign, He waits upon another throne (<a href="psa110.htm#1">Psa 110:1</a>; <a href="rev3.htm#21">Rev 3:21</a>; <a href="eph1.htm#20">Eph 1:20-23</a>; <a href="php2.htm#9">Php 2:9-11</a>).
<li>as Priest, <a href="jer33.htm#18" target="lwr_lt">v.18</a><dd>Today, while Israel has no priest to offer sacrifices in an earthly Temple (<a href="hos3.htm#4">Hos 3:4</a>), they do not lack a Priest in the presence of God (<a href="heb4.htm#14">Heb 4:14-16</a>). In the restoration, Israel will be a nation of priests (<a href="isa56.htm#7">Isa 56:7</a>; <a href="isa61.htm#6">61:6</a>). That restoration is foreshadowed in the spiritual nation of believer-priests today (<a href="1pet2.htm#5">1Pet 2:5,9</a>).</ol>
<dt>III. The Faithfulness of Jehovah, <a href="jer33.htm#19" target="lwr_lt">v.19-26</a><ol type="A">
<li>Tokens: Day and Night, <a href="jer33.htm#19" target="lwr_lt">v.19-21</a><ul>
<li>Covenant with David, v.21<dd>In this closing section of ch. 33, the tokens of the Lord's power and faithfulness to fulfill His unconditional covenant with the seed and nation of Israel (<a href="jer31.htm#35">Jer 31:35-37</a>) are applied to His unconditional covenant with David  (cp. <a href="jer33.htm#14" target="lwr_lt">v.14-17</a>; <a href="2sam23.htm#5">2Sam 23:5</a>; <a href="psa89.htm#3">Psa 89:3,4,29,36</a>; <a href="psa132.htm#11">132:11,17</a>; <a href="luk1.htm#31">Luk 1:31-33</a>).</ul>
<li>Tokens: Stars and Sand, <a href="jer33.htm#22" target="lwr_lt">v.22</a><ul>
<li>Children of David, v.22<dd>Here, the tokens given to Abraham concerning the multiplying of his seed (<a href="gen13.htm#16">Gen 13:16</a>; <a href="gen15.htm#5">15:5</a>) are applied also to the multiplying of  David's seed (cp. <a href="isa53.htm#10">Isa 53:10,11</a>; <a href="psa22.htm#30">Psa 22:30</a>; <a href="rev7.htm#9">Rev 7:9,10</a>), and of the multiplying of priests (cp. v.18 and references in notes at v.18 above).</ul>
<li>Tokens: Day and Night, <a href="jer33.htm#23" target="lwr_lt">v.23-25</a><ul>
<li>Captivity of David, v.26<dd>Jeremiah's contemporaries thought that the Lord had cast off His people (v.24). As they saw it, He had forsaken, not just one, but both families (the northern and the southern kingdoms). But their view revealed their unbelief: &quot;they have despised my people that they should no longer be a people before Me.&quot; Most of christendom has fallen into this same error. Contrary to their unbelief, the Lord makes it unmistakeably clear that He will never forsake the seed of Jacob (the nation of Israel) nor the seed of David (the king of His anointing, cp. <a href="psa2.htm#1">Psa 2</a>), but will fulfill His promises of complete restoration.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the last line of v.26, &quot;I will&quot; is doubled (in the HB text) to emphasize that He is the One who will perform these things: &quot;...for I will cause their captivity to return, and I will have mercy {ie., compassion, as trans. in <a href="deu30.htm#3">Deu 30:3</a>} upon them.&quot;</ul></ol>
