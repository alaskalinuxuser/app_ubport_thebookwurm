Micah   7<br> 1. Woe is me! for I am as when they have gathered the summer fruits, as the grapegleanings of the vintage: [there is] no cluster to eat: my soul desired the firstripe fruit.<br><a name="2">2</a>  The good [man] is perished out of the earth: and [there is] none upright among men: they all lie in wait for blood; they hunt every man his brother with a net.<br><a name="3">3</a>  That they may do evil with both hands earnestly, the prince asketh, and the judge [asketh] for a reward; and the great [man], he uttereth his mischievous desire: so they wrap it up.<br><a name="4">4</a>  The best of them [is] as a brier: the most upright [is sharper] than a thorn hedge: the day of thy watchmen [and] thy visitation cometh; now shall be their perplexity.<br><a name="5">5</a>  Trust ye not in a friend, put ye not confidence in a guide: keep the doors of thy mouth from her that lieth in thy bosom.<br><a name="6">6</a>  For the son dishonoureth the father, the daughter riseth up against her mother, the daughter in law against her mother in law; a man's enemies [are] the men of his own house.<br><a name="7">7</a>. Therefore I will look unto the LORD; I will wait for the God of my salvation: my God will hear me.<br><a name="8">8</a>  Rejoice not against me, O mine enemy: when I fall, I shall arise; when I sit in darkness, the LORD [shall be] a light unto me.<br><a name="9">9</a>  I will bear the indignation of the LORD, because I have sinned against him, until he plead my cause, and execute judgment for me: he will bring me forth to the light, [and] I shall behold his righteousness.<br><a name="10">10</a>  Then [she that is] mine enemy shall see [it], and shame shall cover her which said unto me, Where is the LORD thy God? mine eyes shall behold her: now shall she be trodden down as the mire of the streets.<br><a name="11">11</a>  [In] the day that thy walls are to be built, [in] that day shall the decree be far removed.<br><a name="12">12</a>  [In] that day [also] he shall come even to thee from Assyria, and [from] the fortified cities, and from the fortress even to the river, and from sea to sea, and [from] mountain to mountain.<br><a name="13">13</a>  Notwithstanding the land shall be desolate because of them that dwell therein, for the fruit of their doings.<br><a name="14">14</a>. Feed thy people with thy rod, the flock of thine heritage, which dwell solitarily [in] the wood, in the midst of Carmel: let them feed [in] Bashan and Gilead, as in the days of old.<br><a name="15">15</a>  According to the days of thy coming out of the land of Egypt will I shew unto him marvellous [things].<br><a name="16">16</a>  The nations shall see and be confounded at all their might: they shall lay [their] hand upon [their] mouth, their ears shall be deaf.<br><a name="17">17</a>  They shall lick the dust like a serpent, they shall move out of their holes like worms of the earth: they shall be afraid of the LORD our God, and shall fear because of thee.<br><a name="18">18</a>  Who [is] a God like unto thee, that pardoneth iniquity, and passeth by the transgression of the remnant of his heritage? he retaineth not his anger for ever, because he delighteth [in] mercy.<br><a name="19">19</a>  He will turn again, he will have compassion upon us; he will subdue our iniquities; and thou wilt cast all their sins into the depths of the sea.<br><a name="20">20</a>  Thou wilt perform the truth to Jacob, [and] the mercy to Abraham, which thou hast sworn unto our fathers from the days of old.<br><br>End of Micah.<br>Go to <a href="nah1.htm#1">Nahum 1</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
