Isaiah  21<br>1. The burden of the desert of the sea. As whirlwinds in the south pass through; [so] it cometh from the desert, from a terrible land.<br><a name="2">2</a>  A grievous vision is declared unto me; the treacherous dealer dealeth treacherously, and the spoiler spoileth. Go up, O Elam: besiege, O Media; all the sighing thereof have I made to cease.<br><a name="3">3</a>  Therefore are my loins filled with pain: pangs have taken hold upon me, as the pangs of a woman that travaileth: I was bowed down at the hearing [of it]; I was dismayed at the seeing [of it].<br><a name="4">4</a>  My heart panted, fearfulness affrighted me: the night of my pleasure hath he turned into fear unto me.<br><a name="5">5</a>  Prepare the table, watch in the watchtower, eat, drink: arise, ye princes, [and] anoint the shield.<br><a name="6">6</a>  For thus hath the Lord said unto me, Go, set a watchman, let him declare what he seeth.<br><a name="7">7</a>  And he saw a chariot [with] a couple of horsemen, a chariot of asses, [and] a chariot of camels; and he hearkened diligently with much heed:<br><a name="8">8</a>  And he cried, A lion: My lord, I stand continually upon the watchtower in the daytime, and I am set in my ward whole nights:<br><a name="9">9</a>  And, behold, here cometh a chariot of men, [with] a couple of horsemen. And he answered and said, Babylon is fallen, is fallen; and all the graven images of her gods he hath broken unto the ground.<br><a name="10">10</a>  O my threshing, and the corn of my floor: that which I have heard of the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, have I declared unto you.<br><a name="11">11</a>. The burden of Dumah. He calleth to me out of Seir, Watchman, what of the night? Watchman, what of the night?<br><a name="12">12</a>  The watchman said, The morning cometh, and also the night: if ye will enquire, enquire ye: return, come.<br><a name="13">13</a>. The burden upon Arabia. In the forest in Arabia shall ye lodge, O ye travelling companies of Dedanim.<br><a name="14">14</a>  The inhabitants of the land of Tema brought water to him that was thirsty, they prevented with their bread him that fled.<br><a name="15">15</a>  For they fled from the swords, from the drawn sword, and from the bent bow, and from the grievousness of war.<br><a name="16">16</a>  For thus hath the Lord said unto me, Within a year, according to the years of an hireling, and all the glory of Kedar shall fail:<br><a name="17">17</a>  And the residue of the number of archers, the mighty men of the children of Kedar, shall be diminished: for the LORD God of Israel hath spoken [it].<br><br>Go to <a href="isa22.htm#1">Isaiah 22</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
