Psalms  73<br> 1. A Psalm of Asaph. Truly God [is] good to Israel, [even] to such as are of a clean heart.<br><a name="2">2</a>  But as for me, my feet were almost gone; my steps had well nigh slipped.<br><a name="3">3</a>  For I was envious at the foolish, [when] I saw the prosperity of the wicked.<br><a name="4">4</a>  For [there are] no bands in their death: but their strength [is] firm.<br><a name="5">5</a>  They [are] not in trouble [as other] men; neither are they plagued like [other] men.<br><a name="6">6</a>  Therefore pride compasseth them about as a chain; violence covereth them [as] a garment.<br><a name="7">7</a>  Their eyes stand out with fatness: they have more than heart could wish.<br><a name="8">8</a>  They are corrupt, and speak wickedly [concerning] oppression: they speak loftily.<br><a name="9">9</a>  They set their mouth against the heavens, and their tongue walketh through the earth.<br><a name="10">10</a>  Therefore his people return hither: and waters of a full [cup] are wrung out to them.<br><a name="11">11</a>  And they say, How doth God know? and is there knowledge in the most High?<br><a name="12">12</a>  Behold, these [are] the ungodly, who prosper in the world; they increase [in] riches.<br><a name="13">13</a>  Verily I have cleansed my heart [in] vain, and washed my hands in innocency.<br><a name="14">14</a>  For all the day long have I been plagued, and chastened every morning.<br><a name="15">15</a>. If I say, I will speak thus; behold, I should offend [against] the generation of thy children.<br><a name="16">16</a>  When I thought to know this, it [was] too painful for me;<br><a name="17">17</a>  Until I went into the sanctuary of God; [then] understood I their end.<br><a name="18">18</a>  Surely thou didst set them in slippery places: thou castedst them down into destruction.<br><a name="19">19</a>  How are they [brought] into desolation, as in a moment! they are utterly consumed with terrors.<br><a name="20">20</a>  As a dream when [one] awaketh; [so], O Lord, when thou awakest, thou shalt despise their image.<br><a name="21">21</a>. Thus my heart was grieved, and I was pricked in my reins.<br><a name="22">22</a>  So foolish [was] I, and ignorant: I was [as] a beast before thee.<br><a name="23">23</a>  Nevertheless I [am] continually with thee: thou hast holden [me] by my right hand.<br><a name="24">24</a>  Thou shalt guide me with thy counsel, and afterward receive me [to] glory.<br><a name="25">25</a>  Whom have I in heaven [but thee]? and [there is] none upon earth [that] I desire beside thee.<br><a name="26">26</a>  My flesh and my heart faileth: [but] God [is] the strength of my heart, and my portion for ever.<br><a name="27">27</a>  For, lo, they that are far from thee shall perish: thou hast destroyed all them that go a whoring from thee.<br><a name="28">28</a>  But [it is] good for me to draw near to God: I have put my trust in the Lord GOD, that I may declare all thy works.<br><br>Go to <a href="psa74.htm#1">Psalm 74</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
