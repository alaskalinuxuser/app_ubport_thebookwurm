Out of the depths have I cried unto thee, O LORD.<br><a name="2">2</a>  Lord, hear my voice: let thine ears be attentive to the voice of my supplications.<br><a name="3">3</a>  If thou, LORD, shouldest mark iniquities, O Lord, who shall stand?<br><a name="4">4</a>  But [there is] forgiveness with thee, that thou mayest be feared.<br><a name="5">5</a>. I wait for the LORD, my soul doth wait, and in his word do I hope.<br><a name="6">6</a>  My soul [waiteth] for the Lord more than they that watch for the morning: [I say, more than] they that watch for the morning.<br><a name="7">7</a>  Let Israel hope in the LORD: for with the LORD [there is] mercy, and with him [is] plenteous redemption.<br><a name="8">8</a>  And he shall redeem Israel from all his iniquities.<br><br>Go to <a href="psa131.htm#1">Psalm 131</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
