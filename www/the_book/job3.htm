Job   3<br>1. After this opened Job his mouth, and cursed his day.<br><a name="2">2</a>  And Job spake, and said,<br><a name="3">3</a>  Let the day perish wherein I was born, and the night [in which] it was said, There is a man child conceived.<br><a name="4">4</a>  Let that day be darkness; let not God regard it from above, neither let the light shine upon it.<br><a name="5">5</a>  Let darkness and the shadow of death stain it; let a cloud dwell upon it; let the blackness of the day terrify it.<br><a name="6">6</a>  As [for] that night, let darkness seize upon it; let it not be joined unto the days of the year, let it not come into the number of the months.<br><a name="7">7</a>  Lo, let that night be solitary, let no joyful voice come therein.<br><a name="8">8</a>  Let them curse it that curse the day, who are ready to raise up their mourning.<br><a name="9">9</a>  Let the stars of the twilight thereof be dark; let it look for light, but [have] none; neither let it see the dawning of the day:<br><a name="10">10</a>  Because it shut not up the doors of my [mother's] womb, nor hid sorrow from mine eyes.<br><a name="11">11</a>. Why died I not from the womb? [why] did I [not] give up the ghost when I came out of the belly?<br><a name="12">12</a>  Why did the knees prevent me? or why the breasts that I should suck?<br><a name="13">13</a>  For now should I have lain still and been quiet, I should have slept: then had I been at rest,<br><a name="14">14</a>  With kings and counsellors of the earth, which built desolate places for themselves;<br><a name="15">15</a>  Or with princes that had gold, who filled their houses with silver:<br><a name="16">16</a>  Or as an hidden untimely birth I had not been; as infants [which] never saw light.<br><a name="17">17</a>  There the wicked cease [from] troubling; and there the weary be at rest.<br><a name="18">18</a>  [There] the prisoners rest together; they hear not the voice of the oppressor.<br><a name="19">19</a>  The small and great are there; and the servant [is] free from his master.<br><a name="20">20</a>. Wherefore is light given to him that is in misery, and life unto the bitter [in] soul;<br><a name="21">21</a>  Which long for death, but it [cometh] not; and dig for it more than for hid treasures;<br><a name="22">22</a>  Which rejoice exceedingly, [and] are glad, when they can find the grave?<br><a name="23">23</a>  [Why is light given] to a man whose way is hid, and whom God hath hedged in?<br><a name="24">24</a>  For my sighing cometh before I eat, and my roarings are poured out like the waters.<br><a name="25">25</a>  For the thing which I greatly feared is come upon me, and that which I was afraid of is come unto me.<br><a name="26">26</a>  I was not in safety, neither had I rest, neither was I quiet; yet trouble came.<br><br>Go to <a href="job4.htm#1">Job 4</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
