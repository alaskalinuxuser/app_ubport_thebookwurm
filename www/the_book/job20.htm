Job  20<br>1. Then answered Zophar the Naamathite, and said,<br><a name="2">2</a>  Therefore do my thoughts cause me to answer, and for [this] I make haste.<br><a name="3">3</a>  I have heard the check of my reproach, and the spirit of my understanding causeth me to answer.<br><a name="4">4</a>  Knowest thou [not] this of old, since man was placed upon earth,<br><a name="5">5</a>  That the triumphing of the wicked [is] short, and the joy of the hypocrite [but] for a moment?<br><a name="6">6</a>  Though his excellency mount up to the heavens, and his head reach unto the clouds;<br><a name="7">7</a>  [Yet] he shall perish for ever like his own dung: they which have seen him shall say, Where [is] he?<br><a name="8">8</a>  He shall fly away as a dream, and shall not be found: yea, he shall be chased away as a vision of the night.<br><a name="9">9</a>  The eye also [which] saw him shall [see him] no more; neither shall his place any more behold him.<br><a name="10">10</a>. His children shall seek to please the poor, and his hands shall restore their goods.<br><a name="11">11</a>  His bones are full [of the sin] of his youth, which shall lie down with him in the dust.<br><a name="12">12</a>  Though wickedness be sweet in his mouth, [though] he hide it under his tongue;<br><a name="13">13</a>  [Though] he spare it, and forsake it not; but keep it still within his mouth:<br><a name="14">14</a>  [Yet] his meat in his bowels is turned, [it is] the gall of asps within him.<br><a name="15">15</a>  He hath swallowed down riches, and he shall vomit them up again: God shall cast them out of his belly.<br><a name="16">16</a>  He shall suck the poison of asps: the viper's tongue shall slay him.<br><a name="17">17</a>  He shall not see the rivers, the floods, the brooks of honey and butter.<br><a name="18">18</a>  That which he laboured for shall he restore, and shall not swallow [it] down: according to [his] substance [shall] the restitution [be], and he shall not rejoice [therein].<br><a name="19">19</a>  Because he hath oppressed [and] hath forsaken the poor; [because] he hath violently taken away an house which he builded not;<br><a name="20">20</a>  Surely he shall not feel quietness in his belly, he shall not save of that which he desired.<br><a name="21">21</a>  There shall none of his meat be left; therefore shall no man look for his goods.<br><a name="22">22</a>  In the fulness of his sufficiency he shall be in straits: every hand of the wicked shall come upon him.<br><a name="23">23</a>. [When] he is about to fill his belly, [God] shall cast the fury of his wrath upon him, and shall rain [it] upon him while he is eating.<br><a name="24">24</a>  He shall flee from the iron weapon, [and] the bow of steel shall strike him through.<br><a name="25">25</a>  It is drawn, and cometh out of the body; yea, the glittering sword cometh out of his gall: terrors [are] upon him.<br><a name="26">26</a>  All darkness [shall be] hid in his secret places: a fire not blown shall consume him; it shall go ill with him that is left in his tabernacle.<br><a name="27">27</a>  The heaven shall reveal his iniquity; and the earth shall rise up against him.<br><a name="28">28</a>  The increase of his house shall depart, [and his goods] shall flow away in the day of his wrath.<br><a name="29">29</a>  This [is] the portion of a wicked man from God, and the heritage appointed unto him by God.<br><br>Go to <a href="job21.htm#1">Job 21</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
