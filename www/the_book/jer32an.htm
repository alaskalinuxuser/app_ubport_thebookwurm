<dl><dt><b>The Sign of the Field of Hanameel,</b> ch. 32
<dt>I. Jeremiah's imprisonment, <a href="jer32.htm#1" target="lwr_lt">v.1-5</a><ol type="A">
<li>Its time, v.1,2<br>During the siege of Jerusalem, a few months before its fall (cp. <a href="jer39.htm#1">Jer 39:1,2</a>; <a href="2kin25.htm#1">2Kin 25:1-4</a>), while the king of Babylon's army besieged {lit., was besieging} the city.
<li>Its cause, v.3-5 --  Jeremiah's faithfulness to the Lord's message of judgment.<br>Jerusalem would fall. King Zedekiah would be taken captive. He would look the king of Babylon in the eye (v.4), and then would be carried captive to Babylon, but would not see it (<a href="eze12.htm#13">Eze 12:13</a>; <a href="2kin25.htm#5">2Kin 25:5-7</a>). He would remain there &quot;until I visit him&quot; (ie., until his death; cp. <a href="jer34.htm#4">Jer 34:4,5</a>).</ol>
<dt>II. Jeremiah's purchase, <a href="jer32.htm#6" target="lwr_lt">v.6-15</a><ol type="A">
<li>As forewarned by the Lord, v.6,7<ul>
<li>Hanameel was a second cousin.
<li>The land was in Anathoth, Jeremiah's home town (<a href="jer1.htm#1">Jer 1:1</a>).</ul>
<li>As requested by Hanameel, v.8,9<dd>Hanameel, like everyone in the besieged city, was struggling to survive. Although he owned a field in a neighboring village, his crops were inaccessible, due to the siege. The fall of Jerusalem looked certain. It seemed unlikely that he would ever be able to return to his land. By selling it, perhaps he could purchase a few days worth of bread. He turned to Jeremiah because he had the 'right of redemption.' As a kinsman to his impoverished relative, Jeremiah had the right and responsibility to redeem the land, to the extent that he was able and willing. He purchased the land, in his role as &quot;goel,&quot; a kinsman redeemer  (cp. <a href="lev25.htm#24">Lev 25:24,25</a>; <a href="ruth4.htm#4">Ruth 4:4</a>).
<li>As recorded by Baruch, v.10-14<ul>
<li>The evidence of the purchase: That which is sealed and that which is open.<br>The Title Deed was sealed by the purchaser (v.10). Only he could open it. The public record of the purchase was open for all to read (v.11,12).</ul>
<li>As a Sign, v.15<ul>
<li>Jeremiah's purchase was a sign pointing to Israel's future restoration (v.15).
<li>It is also an illustration of a greater purchase by which the Lord Jesus Christ, our kinsman Redeemer, has secured redemption and restoration for His people, when we were on the point of ruin. The sealed Title Deed to the earth can be opened only by the One who purchased it (<a href="mat13.htm#44">Mat 13:44</a>; <a href="rev5.htm#1">Rev 5:1-5,9</a>), whereas the details of the purchase are recorded for all to read, &quot;in the volume of the book&quot; (ie., in all of scripture, <a href="psa40.htm#6">Psa 40:6-8</a>; <a href="heb10.htm#5">Heb 10:5-12</a>; <a href="joh5.htm#39">John 5:39</a>).</ul></ol>
<dt>III. Jeremiah's prayer, <a href="jer32.htm#16" target="lwr_lt">v.16-25</a><ol type="A">
<li>His acknowledgement of the Lord's greatness, as shown in:<ol type="1">
<li>His Creation, v.17
<li>His Character, v.18; cp. <a href="ex34.htm#6">Ex 34:6,7</a>
<li>His Dealings with mankind in general, v.19
<li>His Dealings with Israel in particular, v.20-24<ul>
<li>their Deliverance from Egypt, v.21
<li>their Establishment in the Land of promise, v.22
<li>their Judgment for sin, v.23-24</ul></ol>
<li>His confusion regarding the Lord's instructions, v.25<dd>
Although Jeremiah had declared that his purchase illustrated the future restoration, he had difficulty seeing the wisdom of owning land, under the circumstances. The land was of no more use to him than it was to Hanameel. Perhaps he should have kept the cash. Was it really possible that Israel would again occupy the land from which they would soon be carried away? His consternation is readily seen in these excerpts from the passage:<br>
Ah, Lord God, behold (v.17)... Behold the mounts {mounds, earthen ramps being constructed by the enemy to surmount the city wall} (v.24)... and Thou hast said... Buy the field for money... for {ie., whereas, or, even though} the city is given into the hand of the Chaldeans (v.25).</ol>
<dt>IV. The Lord's answer, <a href="jer32.htm#26" target="lwr_lt">v.26-44</a><ul>
<li>Is there anything too hard {wonderful, difficult to understand, beyond one's power} for me?. . .<dd>The Lord begins His answer, where Jeremiah began his prayer. <a href="jer32.htm#27" target="lwr_lt">v.27</a>; cp. <a href="jer32.htm#17" target="lwr_lt">v.17</a><br>
Similar words are applied elsewhere to other &quot;impossible&quot; occurrences...<ul>
<li>the birth of Isaac, <a href="gen18.htm#14">Gen 18:14</a>
<li>the birth of Jesus, <a href="luk1.htm#37">Luk 1:37</a>
<li>the new birth, <a href="luk18.htm#25">Luk 18:25-27</a></ul>
<dd>Here, the LORD gently reminds His shaken prophet of His ability to accomplish the rebirth & restoration of Israel. The One who wrought deliverance from a previous siege of Jerusalem (during Hezekiah's reign, <a href="isa37.htm#3">Isa 37:3</a>) will also accomplish the future restoration of Israel (<a href="isa26.htm#17">Isa 26:17,18</a>; <a href="isa66.htm#9">66:9</a>; <a href="mic5.htm#1">Mic 5:1-4</a>).
<li>Is there anything too hard for Me?...<ol type="A">
<li>...in regard to Judgment, <a href="jer32.htm#28" target="lwr_lt">v.28-35</a><ul>
<li>I will give this city into the hand of the Chaldeans... (v.28,29) -
Judgment by fire was befitting to the sins committed. cp. v.29,35
<li>I [will] remove it [the city] from before my face... because they provoked me to anger... (v.30-35)<ul>
<li>... from the day that they built it...- &quot;Solomon, who beautified Jerusalem, also established idolatry in it.&quot; [GWms]
<li>...&quot;by the incurable depravity of human nature, even in the most favorable of circumstances&quot; [GWms] (thus demonstrating the necessity of the new birth).</ul></ul>
<li>...in regard to Restoration, <a href="jer32.htm#36" target="lwr_lt">v.36-41</a> [These points parallel the outline of ch. 30-31]<ul>
<li>I will gather... I will bring them... v.37; cp. <a href="jer30.htm#1">30:1-22</a>
<li>I will be their God... v.38; cp. <a href="jer30.htm#23">30:23 - 31:26</a>
<li>I will give them new hearts... an everlasting covenant v.39,40; cp. <a href="jer31.htm#31">31:31-37</a><ul>
<li>(thus satisfying the necessity of the new birth)
<li>&quot;one heart&quot;- cp. <a href="eze11.htm#17">Eze 11:17-20</a>; <a href="eze36.htm#26">36:26</a></ul>
<li>I will plant them. v.41; cp. <a href="jer31.htm#27">31:27-30,38-40</a></ul>
<li>...in regard to Fulfillment of His Promises, <a href="jer32.htm#42" target="lwr_lt">v.42-44</a><ul>
<li>As the Lord fulfilled his promises for evil (ie., judgment), so, He would accomplish His promises for good (ie., restoration). Jeremiah need not despair (<a href="jer32.htm#24" target="lwr_lt">v.24,25</a>). 
<li>Fields shall (again) be bought in this land (as illustrated by Jeremiah's purchase). Although this was partially fulfilled at the return of the remnant under Ezra and Nehemiah, at that time, Israel did not receive new hearts that would never depart from Him (<a href="jer32.htm#37" target="lwr_lt">v.37-40</a>). Therefore, it is evident that the ultimate fulfillment is yet future. 
<li>In <a href="jer32.htm#44" target="lwr_lt">v.44</a>, the use of the Hebrew &quot;infinite absolute&quot; tense emphasizes &quot;the certain fulfillment of the several predictions in the verse.&quot; [GWms]</ul></ol></ul>
