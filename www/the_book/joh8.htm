Jesus went unto the mount of Olives.<br><a name="2">2</a>  And early in the morning he came again into the temple, and all the people came unto him; and he sat down, and taught them.<br><a name="3">3</a>  And the scribes and Pharisees brought unto him a woman taken in adultery; and when they had set her in the midst,<br><a name="4">4</a>  They say unto him, Master, this woman was taken in adultery, in the very act.<br><a name="5">5</a>  Now Moses in the law commanded us, that such should be stoned: but what sayest thou?<br><a name="6">6</a>  This they said, tempting him, that they might have to accuse him. But Jesus stooped down, and with [his] finger wrote on the ground, [as though he heard them not].<br><a name="7">7</a>  So when they continued asking him, he lifted up himself, and said unto them, He that is without sin among you, let him first cast a stone at her.<br><a name="8">8</a>  And again he stooped down, and wrote on the ground.<br><a name="9">9</a>  And they which heard [it], being convicted by [their own] conscience, went out one by one, beginning at the eldest, [even] unto the last: and Jesus was left alone, and the woman standing in the midst.<br><a name="10">10</a>  When Jesus had lifted up himself, and saw none but the woman, he said unto her, Woman, where are those thine accusers? hath no man condemned thee?<br><a name="11">11</a>  She said, No man, Lord. And Jesus said unto her, Neither do I condemn thee: go, and sin no more.<br><a name="12">12</a>. Then spake Jesus again unto them, saying, I am the light of the world: he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life.<br><a name="13">13</a>  The Pharisees therefore said unto him, Thou bearest record of thyself; thy record is not true.<br><a name="14">14</a>  Jesus answered and said unto them, Though I bear record of myself, [yet] my record is true: for I know whence I came, and whither I go; but ye cannot tell whence I come, and whither I go.<br><a name="15">15</a>  Ye judge after the flesh; I judge no man.<br><a name="16">16</a>  And yet if I judge, my judgment is true: for I am not alone, but I and the Father that sent me.<br><a name="17">17</a>  It is also written in your law, that the testimony of two men is true.<br><a name="18">18</a>  I am one that bear witness of myself, and the Father that sent me beareth witness of me.<br><a name="19">19</a>  Then said they unto him, Where is thy Father? Jesus answered, Ye neither know me, nor my Father: if ye had known me, ye should have known my Father also.<br><a name="20">20</a>  These words spake Jesus in the treasury, as he taught in the temple: and no man laid hands on him; for his hour was not yet come.<br><a name="21">21</a>. Then said Jesus again unto them, I go my way, and ye shall seek me, and shall die in your sins: whither I go, ye cannot come.<br><a name="22">22</a>  Then said the Jews, Will he kill himself? because he saith, Whither I go, ye cannot come.<br><a name="23">23</a>  And he said unto them, Ye are from beneath; I am from above: ye are of this world; I am not of this world.<br><a name="24">24</a>  I said therefore unto you, that ye shall die in your sins: for if ye believe not that I am [he], ye shall die in your sins.<br><a name="25">25</a>  Then said they unto him, Who art thou? And Jesus saith unto them, Even [the same] that I said unto you from the beginning.<br><a name="26">26</a>  I have many things to say and to judge of you: but he that sent me is true; and I speak to the world those things which I have heard of him.<br><a name="27">27</a>  They understood not that he spake to them of the Father.<br><a name="28">28</a>  Then said Jesus unto them, When ye have lifted up the Son of man, then shall ye know that I am [he], and [that] I do nothing of myself; but as my Father hath taught me, I speak these things.<br><a name="29">29</a>  And he that sent me is with me: the Father hath not left me alone; for I do always those things that please him.<br><a name="30">30</a>  As he spake these words, many believed on him.<br><a name="31">31</a>. Then said Jesus to those Jews which believed on him, If ye continue in my word, [then] are ye my disciples indeed;<br><a name="32">32</a>  And ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free.<br><a name="33">33</a>  They answered him, We be Abraham's seed, and were never in bondage to any man: how sayest thou, Ye shall be made free?<br><a name="34">34</a>  Jesus answered them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Whosoever committeth sin is the servant of sin.<br><a name="35">35</a>  And the servant abideth not in the house for ever: [but] the Son abideth ever.<br><a name="36">36</a>  If the Son therefore shall make you free, ye shall be free indeed.<br><a name="37">37</a>  I know that ye are Abraham's seed; but ye seek to kill me, because my word hath no place in you.<br><a name="38">38</a>. I speak that which I have seen with my Father: and ye do that which ye have seen with your father.<br><a name="39">39</a>  They answered and said unto him, Abraham is our father. Jesus saith unto them, If ye were Abraham's children, ye would do the works of Abraham.<br><a name="40">40</a>  But now ye seek to kill me, a man that hath told you the truth, which I have heard of God: this did not Abraham.<br><a name="41">41</a>  Ye do the deeds of your father. Then said they to him, We be not born of fornication; we have one Father, [even] God.<br><a name="42">42</a>  Jesus said unto them, If God were your Father, ye would love me: for I proceeded forth and came from God; neither came I of myself, but he sent me.<br><a name="43">43</a>  Why do ye not understand my speech? [even] because ye cannot hear my word.<br><a name="44">44</a>  Ye are of [your] father the devil, and the lusts of your father ye will do. He was a murderer from the beginning, and abode not in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his own: for he is a liar, and the father of it.<br><a name="45">45</a>  And because I tell [you] the truth, ye believe me not.<br><a name="46">46</a>. Which of you convinceth me of sin? And if I say the truth, why do ye not believe me?<br><a name="47">47</a>  He that is of God heareth God's words: ye therefore hear [them] not, because ye are not of God.<br><a name="48">48</a>  Then answered the Jews, and said unto him, Say we not well that thou art a Samaritan, and hast a devil?<br><a name="49">49</a>  Jesus answered, I have not a devil; but I honour my Father, and ye do dishonour me.<br><a name="50">50</a>  And I seek not mine own glory: there is one that seeketh and judgeth.<br><a name="51">51</a>. Verily, verily, I say unto you, If a man keep my saying, he shall never see death.<br><a name="52">52</a>  Then said the Jews unto him, Now we know that thou hast a devil. Abraham is dead, and the prophets; and thou sayest, If a man keep my saying, he shall never taste of death.<br><a name="53">53</a>  Art thou greater than our father Abraham, which is dead? and the prophets are dead: whom makest thou thyself?<br><a name="54">54</a>  Jesus answered, If I honour myself, my honour is nothing: it is my Father that honoureth me; of whom ye say, that he is your God:<br><a name="55">55</a>  Yet ye have not known him; but I know him: and if I should say, I know him not, I shall be a liar like unto you: but I know him, and keep his saying.<br><a name="56">56</a>  Your father Abraham rejoiced to see my day: and he saw [it], and was glad.<br><a name="57">57</a>  Then said the Jews unto him, Thou art not yet fifty years old, and hast thou seen Abraham?<br><a name="58">58</a>  Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Before Abraham was, I am.<br><a name="59">59</a>  Then took they up stones to cast at him: but Jesus hid himself, and went out of the temple, going through the midst of them, and so passed by.<br><br>Go to <a href="joh9.htm#1">John 9</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
