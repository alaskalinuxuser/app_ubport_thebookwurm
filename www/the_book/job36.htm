Job  36<br>1. Elihu also proceeded, and said,<br><a name="2">2</a>  Suffer me a little, and I will shew thee that [I have] yet to speak on God's behalf.<br><a name="3">3</a>  I will fetch my knowledge from afar, and will ascribe righteousness to my Maker.<br><a name="4">4</a>  For truly my words [shall] not [be] false: he that is perfect in knowledge [is] with thee.<br><a name="5">5</a>. Behold, God [is] mighty, and despiseth not [any: he is] mighty in strength [and] wisdom.<br><a name="6">6</a>  He preserveth not the life of the wicked: but giveth right to the poor.<br><a name="7">7</a>  He withdraweth not his eyes from the righteous: but with kings [are they] on the throne; yea, he doth establish them for ever, and they are exalted.<br><a name="8">8</a>  And if [they be] bound in fetters, [and] be holden in cords of affliction;<br><a name="9">9</a>  Then he sheweth them their work, and their transgressions that they have exceeded.<br><a name="10">10</a>  He openeth also their ear to discipline, and commandeth that they return from iniquity.<br><a name="11">11</a>  If they obey and serve [him], they shall spend their days in prosperity, and their years in pleasures.<br><a name="12">12</a>  But if they obey not, they shall perish by the sword, and they shall die without knowledge.<br><a name="13">13</a>  But the hypocrites in heart heap up wrath: they cry not when he bindeth them.<br><a name="14">14</a>  They die in youth, and their life [is] among the unclean.<br><a name="15">15</a>. He delivereth the poor in his affliction, and openeth their ears in oppression.<br><a name="16">16</a>  Even so would he have removed thee out of the strait [into] a broad place, where [there is] no straitness; and that which should be set on thy table [should be] full of fatness.<br><a name="17">17</a>  But thou hast fulfilled the judgment of the wicked: judgment and justice take hold [on thee].<br><a name="18">18</a>  Because [there is] wrath, [beware] lest he take thee away with [his] stroke: then a great ransom cannot deliver thee.<br><a name="19">19</a>  Will he esteem thy riches? [no], not gold, nor all the forces of strength.<br><a name="20">20</a>  Desire not the night, when people are cut off in their place.<br><a name="21">21</a>  Take heed, regard not iniquity: for this hast thou chosen rather than affliction.<br><a name="22">22</a>  Behold, God exalteth by his power: who teacheth like him?<br><a name="23">23</a>  Who hath enjoined him his way? or who can say, Thou hast wrought iniquity?<br><a name="24">24</a>. Remember that thou magnify his work, which men behold.<br><a name="25">25</a>  Every man may see it; man may behold [it] afar off.<br><a name="26">26</a>  Behold, God [is] great, and we know [him] not, neither can the number of his years be searched out.<br><a name="27">27</a>  For he maketh small the drops of water: they pour down rain according to the vapour thereof:<br><a name="28">28</a>  Which the clouds do drop [and] distil upon man abundantly.<br><a name="29">29</a>  Also can [any] understand the spreadings of the clouds, [or] the noise of his tabernacle?<br><a name="30">30</a>  Behold, he spreadeth his light upon it, and covereth the bottom of the sea.<br><a name="31">31</a>  For by them judgeth he the people; he giveth meat in abundance.<br><a name="32">32</a>  With clouds he covereth the light; and commandeth it [not to shine] by [the cloud] that cometh betwixt.<br><a name="33">33</a>  The noise thereof sheweth concerning it, the cattle also concerning the vapour.<br><br>Go to <a href="job37.htm#1">Job 37</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
