<dl><dt>F. Vengeance and Blessing in the Day of the Lord...<dd>1. Vengeance: destruction of the nations at Armageddon, 34:1-17<br>2. <b>Blessing: restoration of the people and the Land of Israel</b>, 35:1-10
<dt><b><i>1. The wilderness and the solitary place shall be glad for them;<br>and the desert shall rejoice, and blossom as the rose.<br>
2 It shall blossom abundantly, and rejoice even with joy and singing:<br>the glory of Lebanon shall be given unto it, the excellency of Carmel and Sharon,<br>they shall see the glory of the LORD, [and] the excellency of our God.</b></i></dt><dl>
<dt>Chapters 34 and 35 form one prophecy. But the contrast between these two chapters is profound.<dd>In <a href="isa34.htm#1">chapter 34</a>, judgment is poured out upon Edom (the fleshly man, the children of Adam, and the earth which they occupied).<dd>In <a href="isa35.htm#1" target="lwr_lt">chapter 35</a>, blessing is poured out upon God's people (Israel) and the land that He has given them.
<dt>Read v.1 without the words 'for them' (which are absent in the HB text).
<dt>In v.2, 'they' are &quot;the happy inhabitants of that happy land.&quot; [GWms]-<dd>However, they were not always so, for they were the weak, the persecuted, and the downtrodden in the earth, when the children of Adam ruled. Having no strength in themselves, they looked to the Lord (<a href="isa25.htm#4">Isa 25:4</a>).</dl>
<dt><b><i>3 Strengthen ye the weak hands, and confirm the feeble knees. </b></i>{cp. <a href="heb12.htm#11">Heb 12:11,12</a>}<i><b><br>
4 Say to them [that are] of a fearful heart, Be strong, fear not:<br>behold, your God will come [with] vengeance, [even] God [with] a recompence;<br>he will come and save you. </b></i>{cp. <a href="isa28.htm#16">Isa 28:16</a>; <a href="rev2.htm#10">Rev 2:10</a>; <a href="heb10.htm#37">Heb 10:37,38</a>}<i><b><br>
5. Then the eyes of the blind shall be opened, and the ears of the deaf shall be unstopped. </b></i><dd>cp. <a href="isa29.htm#18">Isa 29:18</a>; <a href="isa32.htm#3">32:3,4</a>; <a href="rom11.htm#25">Rom 11:25-27</a><br>The works that accompanied Him at His first coming (<a href="mat11.htm#3">Mat 11:3-6</a>), were just a preview of the blessings of His future Kingdom.<i><b><dt>
6 Then shall the lame [man] leap as an hart, and the tongue of the dumb sing:<br>for in the wilderness shall waters break out, and streams in the desert.<br>
7 And the parched ground shall become a pool, and the thirsty land springs of water:<br>in the habitation of dragons, where each lay, [shall be] grass with reeds and rushes. </b></i><dd>cp. <a href="isa29.htm#17">Isa 29:17</a>; <a href="isa44.htm#3">44:3,4</a>;<dd>cf. the state of the unrepentant world of fleshly men, <a href="isa34.htm#9">Isa 34:9-15</a><i><b><dt>
8 And an highway shall be there, and a way,<br>and it shall be called The way of holiness;<br>the unclean shall not pass over it;<br>but it [shall be] for those: the wayfaring men, though fools, shall not err [therein].</i></b></dt><dl>
<dt>a highway... the way of holiness...- This is &quot;the way of the LORD&quot;<dd>in which only those, whose hearts have been prepared unto holiness, can walk.<dd>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;cp. <a href="mat7.htm#13">Mat 7:13,14</a>; <a href="isa40.htm#3">Isa 40:3</a>; <a href="mal3.htm#1">Mal 3:1</a>; <a href="2tim1.htm#9">2Tim 1:9</a>; <a href="tit2.htm#11">Titus 2:11-14</a>; <a href="1pet1.htm#14">1Pet 1:14,15</a><dd>In that day, even the simplest believer will not stray from 'the straight and narrow way,'  for the Lord will be present with them, guiding them into all truth and protecting from all error.<dd>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;There is such a way open for the believer, who follows hard after God, today (see <a href="joh14.htm#6">Joh 14:6, 15-23</a>; <a href="joh16.htm#12">16:12,13</a>). But in that day, there will be no enemy laying wait to distract or devour the pilgrim on the way (cp. <a href="1pet5.htm#8">1Pet 5:8,9</a>).</dl>
<dt><b><i>9 No lion shall be there, nor [any] ravenous beast shall go up thereon,<br>it shall not be found there; </b></i>{cp. <a href="isa34.htm#12">Isa 34:12</a>; <a href="rev19.htm#20">Rev 19:20</a>}<b><i><br>but the redeemed shall walk [there]:<br>
10 And the ransomed of the LORD shall return,<br>and come to Zion with songs and everlasting joy upon their heads:<br>they shall obtain joy and gladness, and sorrow and sighing shall flee away.</i></b></dt><dl>
<dt>the ransomed of the LORD...- are those who were 'bought with a price' by the Everliving One.<dd>cp. <a href="mat20.htm#28">Mat 20:28</a>; <a href="1tim2.htm#6">1Tim 2:6</a>; <a href="1pet1.htm#18">1Pet 1:18,19</a>
<dt>...shall return... with... everlasting joy upon their heads...-<dd>&quot;With such a Keeper on the way (v.8), and such an asylum at the close (v.10), it is not to be wondered at, that the ransomed of the Lord should be characterised by songs, by joy, and by gladness.&quot; [GWms] (cp. <a href="isa51.htm#10">Isa 51:10,11</a>; <a href="jer31.htm#11">Jer 31:11-14</a>)<blockquote>Puritan commentator, Baxtor, quoted by JVMcGee:<br>&quot;Hasten, O Saviour, the time of Thy return. Delay not, lest the living give up their hope. Delay not, lest earth shall grow like hell, and Thy Church shall be crumbled to dust. O hasten, that great resurrection day, when the graves that received but rottenness, and retain but dust shall return Thee glorious stars and suns. Thy desolate Bride saith, Come. The whole creation saith, Come, even so come, Lord Jesus. The whole creation groaneth and travaileth in pain, waiting for the revealing of the sons of God.&quot; (cp. <a href="rom8.htm#18">Rom 8:18-23</a>; <a href="rev7.htm#9">Rev 7:9-17</a>; <a href="rev21.htm#4">21:4</a>)</blockquote>
