<dl><dt>
<b><i>27:1 When the morning was come,<br>
all the chief priests and elders of the people took counsel against Jesus to put him to death:<br>
27:2 And when they had bound him,<br>
they led [him] away, and delivered him to Pontius Pilate the governor.</i></b> {<a href="psa2.htm#1">Psa 2:1,2</a>}</dt><dl>
<dt>The Sanhedrin reconvened, after day break, to legalize the previous night's proceedings.
<dt>They led Him to Pilate because the death penalty required Roman approval. cp. <a href="joh18.htm#31">Joh 18:31</a></dl><dt>
<b><i>27:3 Then Judas, which had betrayed him, when he saw that he was condemned,<br>
repented himself, and brought again the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders,<br>
27:4 Saying, I have sinned in that I have betrayed the innocent blood. 
<dd></b></i>{ie., I have caused an innocent man to die. (cp. 'sin against innocent blood,' in <a href="1sam19.htm#5">1Sam 19:5</a>)}<i><b><dt>
And they said, What [is that] to us? see thou [to that].<br>
27:5 And he cast down the pieces of silver in the temple, and departed,<br>
and went and hanged himself.</i></b></dt><dl>
<dt>Judas 'repented himself'- or, ''was seized with remorse'' (NIV); ''felt remorse'' (NASV).
<dd>Judas had regret and sorrow that his plans went out of control,<br>
but his sorrow (unlike that of Peter, <a href="mat26.htm#75">26:75</a>) did not involve turning from sin to God. cp. <a href="2cor7.htm#10">2Cor 7:10</a>
<dt>I have sinned...- an ineffective and self-serving acknowledgment, cp. <a href="ex10.htm#16">Ex 10:16</a>; <a href="1sam15.htm#24">1Sam 15:24</a>.
<dd>Judas' fleshly attempts to right his wrongs and assuage his guilt were futile.-<ul>
<li>he turned to the priests. Whether he had hoped to obtain release for Jesus, or pardon for himself, the priests offered no help. 
<li>he returned the blood money. But could not reverse the fact that he had taken it.
<li>he turned against himself. But his act of despair was not redemptive. cp. <a href="mat26.htm#24">Mat 26:24</a>; <a href="act1.htm#25">Acts 1:25b</a></ul>
<dd>But he did not turn to Christ, who even then would have forgiven him. cp. <a href="joh5.htm#40">Joh 5:40</a></dl><dt>
<b><i>27:6 And the chief priests took the silver pieces, and said,<br>
It is not lawful for to put them into the treasury, because it is the price of blood.<br>
27:7 And they took counsel, and bought with them the potter's field, to bury strangers in.<br>
27:8 Wherefore that field was called, The field of blood, unto this day. </b></i>{<a href="act1.htm#19">Acts 1:19</a>}<i><b><br>
27:9 Then was fulfilled that which was spoken by Jeremy the prophet, saying,<br>
And they took the thirty pieces of silver,<br>
the price of him that was valued, whom they of the children of Israel did value;<br>
27:10 And gave them for the potter's field, as the Lord appointed me.</i></b> {<a href="zech11.htm#12">Zech 11:12,13</a>}</dt><dl>
<dt>it is not lawful... because it is the price of blood.- 
<dd>What a mixture of religious scruples and hypocrisy! cp. <a href="mat23.htm#24">Mat 23:24</a><ul>
<li>They admit to having spent blood money. They are as guilty as Judas.
<li>They could not return the money to the Temple treasurey, because it was tainted.</ul>
<dt>Their actions were in fulfillment of prophecy. 
<dd>The quoted passage, from Zechariah, is attributed to Jeremiah (in v.9), probably because Jeremiah was the first book on the scroll of the prophets (which included the book of Zechariah).
<dt>Note: There is no conflict between <a href="mat27.htm#5" target="lwr_lt">v.5-8</a> and <a href="act1.htm#18">Acts 1:18,19</a>. 
<dd>Apparently, Judas hanged himself from a tree in the potter's field. A few days later, when the priests brought his money to purchase the field, his bloated body was discovered and cut down, bursting open where it fell.</dl><dt>
<b><i>27:11 And Jesus stood before the governor: 
<dd></b></i>{Jesus before Pilate, cp. <a href="mar15.htm#2">Mark 15:2-5</a>; <a href="luk23.htm#1">Luk 23:1-3</a>; <a href="joh18.htm#29">Joh 18:29-38</a>}<i><b><dt>
and the governor asked him, saying, Art thou the King of the Jews?<br>
And Jesus said unto him, Thou sayest. </b></i>{ie., It is as you say. cp. <a href="joh18.htm#33">Joh 18:33-37</a>}<i><b><br>
27:12 And when he was accused of the chief priests and elders, he answered nothing.<br>
27:13 Then said Pilate unto him,<br>
Hearest thou not how many things they witness against thee?<br>
27:14 And he answered him to never a word; insomuch that the governor marvelled greatly.</i></b></dt><dl>
<dt>Are you the King of the Jews?
<dd>Because the charge of ''blasphemy'' (<a href="mat26.htm#65">26:65,66</a>) would not stand up in a Roman court, the religious leaders accuse Jesus of claiming to be a king (by implication, accusing Him of insurrection against Caesar). 
<dt>Jesus acknowledged that He is the King of the Jews, 
<dd>but He made no defense against their false charges. cp. <a href="isa53.htm#7">Isa 53:7</a>
<dd>He made no appeal to Caesar (as did Paul in <a href="act25.htm#11">Acts 25:11</a>).<br>He entrusted His case to a Higher Court. <a href="1pet2.htm#23">1Pet 2:23</a>
<dt>Meanwhile, Pilate was on trial before the King of kings. cp. <a href="jer23.htm#5">Jer 23:5</a>
<dd>Would he exercise true judgment and justice?</dl><dt>
<b><i>27:15 Now at [that] feast the governor was wont to </b></i>{ie., was accustomed to}<i><b> release<br>unto the people a prisoner, whom they would.<br>
27:16 And they had then a notable prisoner, called Barabbas.<br>
27:17 Therefore when they were gathered together, Pilate said unto them,<br>
Whom will ye that I release unto you? Barabbas, or Jesus which is called Christ?<br>
27:18 For he knew that for envy they had delivered him.<br>
27:19 When he was set down on the judgment seat, his wife sent unto him, saying,<br>
Have thou nothing to do with that just man:<br>
for I have suffered many things this day in a dream because of him.<br>
27:20 But the chief priests and elders persuaded the multitude<br>
that they should ask Barabbas, and destroy Jesus.<br>
27:21 The governor answered and said unto them,<br>
Whether of the twain </b></i>{ie., which of the two}<i><b> will ye that I release unto you?<br>
They said, Barabbas.<br>
27:22 Pilate saith unto them, What shall I do then with Jesus which is called Christ?<br>
[They] all say unto him, Let him be crucified.<br>
27:23 And the governor said, Why, what evil hath he done?<br>
But they cried out the more, saying, Let him be crucified.<br>
27:24 When Pilate saw that he could prevail nothing, but [that] rather a tumult was made,<br>
he took water, and washed [his] hands before the multitude, saying,<br>
I am innocent of the blood of this just person: see ye [to it].<br>
27:25 Then answered all the people, and said, His blood [be] on us, and on our children.<br>
27:26 Then released he Barabbas unto them:<br>
and when he had scourged Jesus, he delivered [him] to be crucified.</i></b></dt><dl>
<dt>Pilate, as the representative of Roman justice, and a keen politician...-<ol type="A">
<li>recognized - (a) Jesus' innocence, and<dd>(b) the Jew's motivation: envy, <a href="mat27.htm#18" target="lwr_lt">v.18</a>; cp. <a href="mat21.htm#38">Mat 21:38</a>; <a href="joh15.htm#22">Joh 15:22-25</a>; <a href="rom1.htm#29">Rom 1:29</a></dd><dd>(cp. also the picture of Christ in Joseph's rejection by his brothers, <a href="gen37.htm#11">Gen 37:11</a>).</dd>
<li>attempted a political maneuver to release Jesus, while retaining political favor for himself (<a href="mat27.htm#21" target="lwr_lt">v.21</a>).<dd>By giving the decision to the people, he hoped to thwart the designs of the religious rulers, without suffering their wrath.</dd>
<li>asked the crowd to sentence Jesus. <a href="mat27.htm#22" target="lwr_lt">v.22</a>
<li>delivered Jesus to crucifixion, though there was no judgment against Him.<dd>At the end of the proceedings, he is still asking: ''What evil has He done?'' (<a href="mat27.htm#23" target="lwr_lt">v.23</a>),</dd><dd>and identifies Him as ''this just {ie., righteous} person'' (<a href="mat27.htm#24" target="lwr_lt">v.24</a>).</dd>
<li>declared himself innocent of Jesus' blood (<a href="mat27.htm#24" target="lwr_lt">v.24</a>).<dd>Yet, Pilate stands condemned. It was his responsibility and power to ensure justice.</dd></ol>
<dt>His blood be upon us...- <a href="mat27.htm#25" target="lwr_lt">v.25</a>; cp. <a href="deu19.htm#10">Deu 19:10</a>; <a href="mat21.htm#44">Mat 21:44</a>; <a href="mat23.htm#29">23:29-38</a>; <a href="act5.htm#28">Acts 5:28</a>
<dd>This declaration has been fulfilled by the destruction of Jerusalem and centuries of dispersion.
<dd>Some have erroneously used this verse to label Jews as ''Christ killers.'' They forget that...<ol type="a">
<li>Jews and Gentiles alike had a part in His death. 
<li>Christ forgave those who crucified Him, while He was still on the cross. <a href="luk23.htm#34">Luk 23:34</a>
<li>''Christ died for <i>our</i> sins...'' because we were all guilty. <a href="1cor15.htm#3">1Cor 15:3</a>
<li>Through His death, there is forgiveness for all who call upon Him in faith. <a href="act2.htm#22">Acts 2:22-24,36-38</a></ol></dl><dt>
<b><i>27:27 Then the soldiers of the governor took Jesus into the common hall,<br>
and gathered unto him the whole band [of soldiers].<br>
27:28 And they stripped him, and put on him a scarlet robe.<br>
27:29 And when they had platted a crown of thorns,<br>
they put [it] upon his head, and a reed in his right hand:<br>
and they bowed the knee before him, and mocked him, saying, Hail, King of the Jews!<br>
27:30 And they spit upon him, and took the reed, and smote him on the head. </b></i>{<a href="isa50.htm#6">Isa 50:6</a>}<i><b><br>
27:31 And after that they had mocked him, they took the robe off from him,<br>
and put his own raiment on him, and led him away to crucify [him].<br>
27:32 And as they came out, they found a man of Cyrene, Simon by name:<br>
him they compelled to bear his cross.</i></b></dt><dl>
<dt>Jesus was led away for crucifixion. cp. <a href="mar15.htm#16">Mark 15:16-21</a>; <a href="luk23.htm#26">Luk 23:26-32</a>; <a href="joh19.htm#16">Joh 19:16,17</a>
<dt>This marks the final and full rejection of Jesus as the King of the Jews.
<dd>He claimed David's throne. They gave Him a cross.
<dd>He claimed David's crown. They gave Him a crown of thorns.
<dt>He was scourged, smitten, crowned with thorns, spat upon... cp. <a href="isa52.htm#14">Isa 52:14</a>
<dd>Jesus was so weakened by this ordeal, that He could not carry His own cross.
<dt>Rejected by the Jews, He was mocked by the Gentiles.<dd>Would I have joined in the mockery? cp. <a href="isa53.htm#3">Isa 53:3,4</a></dl><dt>
<b><i>27:33 And when they were come unto a place called Golgotha,<br>
that is to say, a place of a skull,<br>
27:34 They gave him vinegar to drink mingled with gall: </b></i>{<a href="psa69.htm#21">Psa 69:21</a>}<i><b><br>
and when he had tasted [thereof], he would not drink.<br>
27:35 And they crucified him, and parted his garments, casting lots:<br>
that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet,<br>
They parted my garments among them, and upon my vesture did they cast lots. </b></i>{<a href="psa22.htm#18">Psa 22:18</a>}<i><b><br>
27:36 And sitting down they watched him there;<br>
27:37 And set up over his head his accusation written,<br>
THIS IS JESUS THE KING OF THE JEWS.</i></b></dt><dl>
<dt>Golgotha (HB), Calvary (GK=kranion)- the place of the skull.
<dd>The probable place is known today as 'Gordon's Calvary,' located outside the northwestern corner of Jerusalem's old city wall. The hill was partially excavated as a stone quarry giving it the appearance of a skull. The empty 'Garden Tomb,' located at the base of the hill, is the probable place of Jesus' burial.
<dt>and they crucified Him...- cp. <a href="mar15.htm#22">Mark 15:22-32</a>; <a href="luk23.htm#33">Luk 23:33-43</a>; <a href="joh19.htm#17">Joh 19:17-24</a>
<dd>In all four gospels, the narrative is reverently hushed. The violence and gore of crucifixion is muted.<br>
<a href="psa22.htm#1">Psalm 22</a>, written about 1000 years prior to this event, paints the scene in vivid detail,<br>
describing the physical agonies of crucifixion (at a time when crucifixion was unknown), and<br>
revealing our Lord's emotional and spiritual agonies which far outweighed His physical pains.<br>
(See the<i> Book Notes </i>studies on <a href="psm_go.htm" target="_blank">the Psalms of Messiah</a> for <b>Psalm 22</b>.)
<dt>The full accusation (ie., a composite of the four accounts) reads:
<dd>''This is Jesus of Nazareth the King of the Jews.''<br>
Consider this title in the light of <a href="psa2.htm#1">Psa 2:1-6</a> --<ol type="A">
<li>The kings of the earth {Gentile authorities} and the rulers {Jewish leaders} took counsel against the LORD and His Anointed {ie., the Messiah, the Christ}. They rejected Him, and condemned Him to death.
<li>In response, the LORD declares: ''Yet, have I set my King upon my holy hill of Zion.''<br>
The HB word for ''set'' means (a) ''to anoint,'' (b) ''to pour out'' -<ol type="a">
<li>Some day God's Anointed One will reign as King from Mount Zion {ie., Jerusalem}.
<li>This day, God's Anointed One was poured out for our sins, on Mt. Zion. cp. <a href="isa53.htm#12">Isa 53:12</a></ol>
(See the<i> Book Notes </i>studies on <a href="psm_go.htm" target="_blank">the Psalms of Messiah</a> for <b>Psalm 2</b>.)</ol>

<li>Ramah was associated with Samuel, as the place of his birth (<a href="1sam1.htm#1">1Sam 1:1,19,20</a>) and as his home during his prophetic ministry (<a href="1sam8.htm#4">1Sam 8:4</a>). It was here that Israel's first request for a king was registered (<a href="1sam8.htm#5">1Sam 8:5</a>), and here, Saul was anointed as their first king. But after God rejected Saul, He called Samuel from Ramah to Bethlehem with the message: ''I have provided Me a King...'', and instructed him to anoint one of Jesse's sons (<a href="1sam15.htm#34">1Sam 15:34 -16:1</a>). Thus, Samuel anointed David as king, long before he received the kingdom, and while he was hated and rejected by the reigning power.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, Joseph from Ramah, in the act of anointing His body for burial, reminds us that, even in death, Jesus is still God's Anointed (<a href="psa2.htm#1">Psa 2:1,2,6</a>).
<li>Ramah was also associated with a prophecy of Israel's judgment and future restoration.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just prior to Jerusalem's fall to Babylon, the Lord comforted the nation with a promise of future joy (cp. <a href="jer31.htm#15">Jer 31:15-17</a>), which will be realized under the New Covenant (<a href="jer31.htm#31">Jer 31:31-34</a>).<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Early in Jesus' earthly life, a time of sorrow brought this passage to mind (<a href="mat2.htm#16">Mat 2:16-18</a>). So, here, at His death, &quot;the New Covenant in my blood&quot; secures the promised future rejoicing, for all believers (<a href="joh16.htm#20">Joh 16:20</a>), and for the remnant of Israel (<a href="jer31.htm#1">Jer 31:1-40</a>).</ol></dl><dt>
<b><i>27:62 Now the next day, that followed the day of the preparation,<br>
the chief priests and Pharisees came together unto Pilate,<br>
27:63 Saying, Sir, we remember that that deceiver said, while he was yet alive,<br>
After three days I will rise again.<br>
27:64 Command therefore that the sepulchre be made sure until the third day,<br>
lest his disciples come by night, and steal him away,<br>
and say unto the people, He is risen from the dead:<br>
so the last error shall be worse than the first.<br>
27:65 Pilate said unto them, Ye have a watch </b></i>{ie., a guard detail, a group of soldiers}<i><b>:<br>
go your way, make [it] as sure as ye can.<br>
27:66 So they went, and made the sepulchre sure,<br>
sealing the stone, and setting a watch.</i></b> {ie., posting a group of guards}</dt><dl>
<dt>we remember... - Jesus' enemies feared the frequently repeated prophecy,
<dd>that was such a mystery to His disciples. eg., <a href="luk18.htm#33">Luk 18:33,34</a>
<dt>ye have a guard... make it as secure as you can.-
<dd>''The zeal of the enemy actually gave confirmation of His resurrection'' and undermines their official explanation for the empty tomb. cp. <a href="mat28.htm#12">Mat 28:12-14</a> [JVMcGee]
<dd>The King, though sealed in the tomb, and guarded by His enemies, would keep His Word.
