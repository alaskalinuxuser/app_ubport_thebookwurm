2Chronicles  14<br>1. So Abijah slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the city of David: and Asa his son reigned in his stead. In his days the land was quiet ten years.<br><a name="2">2</a>  And Asa did [that which was] good and right in the eyes of the LORD his God:<br><a name="3">3</a>  For he took away the altars of the strange [gods], and the high places, and brake down the images, and cut down the groves:<br><a name="4">4</a>  And commanded Judah to seek the LORD God of their fathers, and to do the law and the commandment.<br><a name="5">5</a>  Also he took away out of all the cities of Judah the high places and the images: and the kingdom was quiet before him.<br><a name="6">6</a>  And he built fenced cities in Judah: for the land had rest, and he had no war in those years; because the LORD had given him rest.<br><a name="7">7</a>  Therefore he said unto Judah, Let us build these cities, and make about [them] walls, and towers, gates, and bars, [while] the land [is] yet before us; because we have sought the LORD our God, we have sought [him], and he hath given us rest on every side. So they built and prospered.<br><a name="8">8</a>  And Asa had an army [of men] that bare targets and spears, out of Judah three hundred thousand; and out of Benjamin, that bare shields and drew bows, two hundred and fourscore thousand: all these [were] mighty men of valour.<br><a name="9">9</a>. And there came out against them Zerah the Ethiopian with an host of a thousand thousand, and three hundred chariots; and came unto Mareshah.<br><a name="10">10</a>  Then Asa went out against him, and they set the battle in array in the valley of Zephathah at Mareshah.<br><a name="11">11</a>  And Asa cried unto the LORD his God, and said, LORD, [it is] nothing with thee to help, whether with many, or with them that have no power: help us, O LORD our God; for we rest on thee, and in thy name we go against this multitude. O LORD, thou [art] our God; let not man prevail against thee.<br><a name="12">12</a>  So the LORD smote the Ethiopians before Asa, and before Judah; and the Ethiopians fled.<br><a name="13">13</a>  And Asa and the people that [were] with him pursued them unto Gerar: and the Ethiopians were overthrown, that they could not recover themselves; for they were destroyed before the LORD, and before his host; and they carried away very much spoil.<br><a name="14">14</a>  And they smote all the cities round about Gerar; for the fear of the LORD came upon them: and they spoiled all the cities; for there was exceeding much spoil in them.<br><a name="15">15</a>  They smote also the tents of cattle, and carried away sheep and camels in abundance, and returned to Jerusalem.<br><br>Go to <a href="2chr15.htm#1">II Chronicles 15</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
