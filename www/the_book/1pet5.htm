1Peter   5<br> 1. The elders which are among you I exhort, who am also an elder, and a witness of the sufferings of Christ, and also a partaker of the glory that shall be revealed:<br><a name="2">2</a>  Feed the flock of God which is among you, taking the oversight [thereof], not by constraint, but willingly; not for filthy lucre, but of a ready mind;<br><a name="3">3</a>  Neither as being lords over [God's] heritage, but being ensamples to the flock.<br><a name="4">4</a>  And when the chief Shepherd shall appear, ye shall receive a crown of glory that fadeth not away.<br><a name="5">5</a>. Likewise, ye younger, submit yourselves unto the elder. Yea, all [of you] be subject one to another, and be clothed with humility: for God resisteth the proud, and giveth grace to the humble.<br><a name="6">6</a>  Humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God, that he may exalt you in due time:<br><a name="7">7</a>  Casting all your care upon him; for he careth for you.<br><a name="8">8</a>. Be sober, be vigilant; because your adversary the devil, as a roaring lion, walketh about, seeking whom he may devour:<br><a name="9">9</a>  Whom resist stedfast in the faith, knowing that the same afflictions are accomplished in your brethren that are in the world.<br><a name="10">10</a>. But the God of all grace, who hath called us unto his eternal glory by Christ Jesus, after that ye have suffered a while, make you perfect, stablish, strengthen, settle [you].<br><a name="11">11</a>  To him [be] glory and dominion for ever and ever. Amen.<br><a name="12">12</a>  By Silvanus, a faithful brother unto you, as I suppose, I have written briefly, exhorting, and testifying that this is the true grace of God wherein ye stand.<br><a name="13">13</a>  The [church that is] at Babylon, elected together with [you], saluteth you; and [so doth] Marcus my son.<br><a name="14">14</a>  Greet ye one another with a kiss of charity. Peace [be] with you all that are in Christ Jesus. Amen.<br><br>End of I Peter.<br>Go to <a href="2pet1.htm#1">II Peter 1</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
