Ezekiel   3<br>1. Moreover he said unto me, Son of man, eat that thou findest; eat this roll, and go speak unto the house of Israel.<br><a name="2">2</a>  So I opened my mouth, and he caused me to eat that roll.<br><a name="3">3</a>  And he said unto me, Son of man, cause thy belly to eat, and fill thy bowels with this roll that I give thee. Then did I eat [it]; and it was in my mouth as honey for sweetness.<br><a name="4">4</a>  And he said unto me, Son of man, go, get thee unto the house of Israel, and speak with my words unto them.<br><a name="5">5</a>  For thou [art] not sent to a people of a strange speech and of an hard language, [but] to the house of Israel;<br><a name="6">6</a>  Not to many people of a strange speech and of an hard language, whose words thou canst not understand. Surely, had I sent thee to them, they would have hearkened unto thee.<br><a name="7">7</a>  But the house of Israel will not hearken unto thee; for they will not hearken unto me: for all the house of Israel [are] impudent and hardhearted.<br><a name="8">8</a>  Behold, I have made thy face strong against their faces, and thy forehead strong against their foreheads.<br><a name="9">9</a>  As an adamant harder than flint have I made thy forehead: fear them not, neither be dismayed at their looks, though they [be] a rebellious house.<br><a name="10">10</a>  Moreover he said unto me, Son of man, all my words that I shall speak unto thee receive in thine heart, and hear with thine ears.<br><a name="11">11</a>  And go, get thee to them of the captivity, unto the children of thy people, and speak unto them, and tell them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear.<br><a name="12">12</a>  Then the spirit took me up, and I heard behind me a voice of a great rushing, [saying], Blessed [be] the glory of the LORD from his place.<br><a name="13">13</a>  [I heard] also the noise of the wings of the living creatures that touched one another, and the noise of the wheels over against them, and a noise of a great rushing.<br><a name="14">14</a>  So the spirit lifted me up, and took me away, and I went in bitterness, in the heat of my spirit; but the hand of the LORD was strong upon me.<br><a name="15">15</a>  Then I came to them of the captivity at Telabib, that dwelt by the river of Chebar, and I sat where they sat, and remained there astonished among them seven days.<br><a name="16">16</a>. And it came to pass at the end of seven days, that the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,<br><a name="17">17</a>  Son of man, I have made thee a watchman unto the house of Israel: therefore hear the word at my mouth, and give them warning from me.<br><a name="18">18</a>  When I say unto the wicked, Thou shalt surely die; and thou givest him not warning, nor speakest to warn the wicked from his wicked way, to save his life; the same wicked [man] shall die in his iniquity; but his blood will I require at thine hand.<br><a name="19">19</a>  Yet if thou warn the wicked, and he turn not from his wickedness, nor from his wicked way, he shall die in his iniquity; but thou hast delivered thy soul.<br><a name="20">20</a>  Again, When a righteous [man] doth turn from his righteousness, and commit iniquity, and I lay a stumblingblock before him, he shall die: because thou hast not given him warning, he shall die in his sin, and his righteousness which he hath done shall not be remembered; but his blood will I require at thine hand.<br><a name="21">21</a>  Nevertheless if thou warn the righteous [man], that the righteous sin not, and he doth not sin, he shall surely live, because he is warned; also thou hast delivered thy soul.<br><a name="22">22</a>. And the hand of the LORD was there upon me; and he said unto me, Arise, go forth into the plain, and I will there talk with thee.<br><a name="23">23</a>  Then I arose, and went forth into the plain: and, behold, the glory of the LORD stood there, as the glory which I saw by the river of Chebar: and I fell on my face.<br><a name="24">24</a>  Then the spirit entered into me, and set me upon my feet, and spake with me, and said unto me, Go, shut thyself within thine house.<br><a name="25">25</a>  But thou, O son of man, behold, they shall put bands upon thee, and shall bind thee with them, and thou shalt not go out among them:<br><a name="26">26</a>  And I will make thy tongue cleave to the roof of thy mouth, that thou shalt be dumb, and shalt not be to them a reprover: for they [are] a rebellious house.<br><a name="27">27</a>  But when I speak with thee, I will open thy mouth, and thou shalt say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; He that heareth, let him hear; and he that forbeareth, let him forbear: for they [are] a rebellious house.<br><br>Go to <a href="eze4.htm#1">Ezekiel 4</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
