Psalms  35<br> 1. [A Psalm] of David. Plead [my cause], O LORD, with them that strive with me: fight against them that fight against me.<br><a name="2">2</a>  Take hold of shield and buckler, and stand up for mine help.<br><a name="3">3</a>  Draw out also the spear, and stop [the way] against them that persecute me: say unto my soul, I [am] thy salvation.<br><a name="4">4</a>  Let them be confounded and put to shame that seek after my soul: let them be turned back and brought to confusion that devise my hurt.<br><a name="5">5</a>  Let them be as chaff before the wind: and let the angel of the LORD chase [them].<br><a name="6">6</a>  Let their way be dark and slippery: and let the angel of the LORD persecute them.<br><a name="7">7</a>  For without cause have they hid for me their net [in] a pit, [which] without cause they have digged for my soul.<br><a name="8">8</a>  Let destruction come upon him at unawares; and let his net that he hath hid catch himself: into that very destruction let him fall.<br><a name="9">9</a>  And my soul shall be joyful in the LORD: it shall rejoice in his salvation.<br><a name="10">10</a>  All my bones shall say, LORD, who [is] like unto thee, which deliverest the poor from him that is too strong for him, yea, the poor and the needy from him that spoileth him?<br><a name="11">11</a>. False witnesses did rise up; they laid to my charge [things] that I knew not.<br><a name="12">12</a>  They rewarded me evil for good [to] the spoiling of my soul.<br><a name="13">13</a>  But as for me, when they were sick, my clothing [was] sackcloth: I humbled my soul with fasting; and my prayer returned into mine own bosom.<br><a name="14">14</a>  I behaved myself as though [he had been] my friend [or] brother: I bowed down heavily, as one that mourneth [for his] mother.<br><a name="15">15</a>  But in mine adversity they rejoiced, and gathered themselves together: [yea], the abjects gathered themselves together against me, and I knew [it] not; they did tear [me], and ceased not:<br><a name="16">16</a>  With hypocritical mockers in feasts, they gnashed upon me with their teeth.<br><a name="17">17</a>. Lord, how long wilt thou look on? rescue my soul from their destructions, my darling from the lions.<br><a name="18">18</a>  I will give thee thanks in the great congregation: I will praise thee among much people.<br><a name="19">19</a>  Let not them that are mine enemies wrongfully rejoice over me: [neither] let them wink with the eye that hate me without a cause.<br><a name="20">20</a>  For they speak not peace: but they devise deceitful matters against [them that are] quiet in the land.<br><a name="21">21</a>  Yea, they opened their mouth wide against me, [and] said, Aha, aha, our eye hath seen [it].<br><a name="22">22</a>  [This] thou hast seen, O LORD: keep not silence: O Lord, be not far from me.<br><a name="23">23</a>  Stir up thyself, and awake to my judgment, [even] unto my cause, my God and my Lord.<br><a name="24">24</a>  Judge me, O LORD my God, according to thy righteousness; and let them not rejoice over me.<br><a name="25">25</a>  Let them not say in their hearts, Ah, so would we have it: let them not say, We have swallowed him up.<br><a name="26">26</a>  Let them be ashamed and brought to confusion together that rejoice at mine hurt: let them be clothed with shame and dishonour that magnify [themselves] against me.<br><a name="27">27</a>  Let them shout for joy, and be glad, that favour my righteous cause: yea, let them say continually, Let the LORD be magnified, which hath pleasure in the prosperity of his servant.<br><a name="28">28</a>  And my tongue shall speak of thy righteousness [and] of thy praise all the day long.<br><br>Go to <a href="psa36.htm#1">Psalm 36</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
