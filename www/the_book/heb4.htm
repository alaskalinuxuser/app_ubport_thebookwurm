Hebrews   4<br> 1. Let us therefore fear, lest, a promise being left [us] of entering into his rest, any of you should seem to come short of it.<br><a name="2">2</a>  For unto us was the gospel preached, as well as unto them: but the word preached did not profit them, not being mixed with faith in them that heard [it].<br><a name="3">3</a>  For we which have believed do enter into rest, as he said, As I have sworn in my wrath, if they shall enter into my rest: although the works were finished from the foundation of the world.<br><a name="4">4</a>  For he spake in a certain place of the seventh [day] on this wise, And God did rest the seventh day from all his works.<br><a name="5">5</a>  And in this [place] again, If they shall enter into my rest.<br><a name="6">6</a>  Seeing therefore it remaineth that some must enter therein, and they to whom it was first preached entered not in because of unbelief:<br><a name="7">7</a>  Again, he limiteth a certain day, saying in David, To day, after so long a time; as it is said, To day if ye will hear his voice, harden not your hearts.<br><a name="8">8</a>  For if Jesus {ie., Joshua} had given them rest, then would he not afterward have spoken of another day.<br><a name="9">9</a>  There remaineth therefore a rest to the people of God.<br><a name="10">10</a>  For he that is entered into his rest, he also hath ceased from his own works, as God [did] from his.<br><a name="11">11</a>. Let us labour therefore to enter into that rest, lest any man fall after the same example of unbelief.<br><a name="12">12</a>  For the word of God [is] quick, and powerful, and sharper than any twoedged sword, piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit, and of the joints and marrow, and [is] a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart.<br><a name="13">13</a>  Neither is there any creature that is not manifest in his sight: but all things [are] naked and opened unto the eyes of him with whom we have to do.<br><a name="14">14</a>  Seeing then that we have a great high priest, that is passed into the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast [our] profession.<br><a name="15">15</a>  For we have not an high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities; but was in all points tempted like as [we are, yet] without sin.<br><a name="16">16</a>  Let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need.<br><br>Go to <a href="heb5.htm#1">Hebrews 5</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
