Romans   5<br> 1. Therefore being justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ:<br><a name="2">2</a>  By whom also we have access by faith into this grace wherein we stand, and rejoice in hope of the glory of God.<br><a name="3">3</a>  And not only [so], but we glory in tribulations also: knowing that tribulation worketh patience;<br><a name="4">4</a>  And patience, experience; and experience, hope:<br><a name="5">5</a>  And hope maketh not ashamed; because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given unto us.<br><a name="6">6</a>. For when we were yet without strength, in due time Christ died for the ungodly.<br><a name="7">7</a>  For scarcely for a righteous man will one die: yet peradventure for a good man some would even dare to die.<br><a name="8">8</a>  But God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.<br><a name="9">9</a>  Much more then, being now justified by his blood, we shall be saved from wrath through him.<br><a name="10">10</a>  For if, when we were enemies, we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son, much more, being reconciled, we shall be saved by his life.<br><a name="11">11</a>  And not only [so], but we also joy in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom we have now received the atonement.<br><a name="12">12</a>  Wherefore, as by one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and so death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned:<br><a name="13">13</a>  (For until the law sin was in the world: but sin is not imputed when there is no law.<br><a name="14">14</a>  Nevertheless death reigned from Adam to Moses, even over them that had not sinned after the similitude of Adam's transgression, who is the figure of him that was to come.<br><a name="15">15</a>  But not as the offence, so also [is] the free gift. For if through the offence of one many be dead, much more the grace of God, and the gift by grace, [which is] by one man, Jesus Christ, hath abounded unto many.<br><a name="16">16</a>  And not as [it was] by one that sinned, [so is] the gift: for the judgment [was] by one to condemnation, but the free gift [is] of many offences unto justification.<br><a name="17">17</a>  For if by one man's offence death reigned by one; much more they which receive abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness shall reign in life by one, Jesus Christ.)<br><a name="18">18</a>  Therefore as by the offence of one [judgment came] upon all men to condemnation; even so by the righteousness of one [the free gift came] upon all men unto justification of life.<br><a name="19">19</a>  For as by one man's disobedience many were made sinners, so by the obedience of one shall many be made righteous.<br><a name="20">20</a>  Moreover the law entered, that the offence might abound. But where sin abounded, grace did much more abound:<br><a name="21">21</a>  That as sin hath reigned unto death, even so might grace reign through righteousness unto eternal life by Jesus Christ our Lord.<br><br>Go to <a href="rom6.htm#1">Romans 6</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
