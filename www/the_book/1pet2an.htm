<dt>III. Suffering and the Suffering of Christ (ch.2-4)
<dd>(A.) Produces Separation (ch.2) -<ol type="1"><li>God's children belong to Him, for ever (v.1-10).<li>God's children live for Him, in the present (v.11-25).</ol>
<dd>(B.) Produces Christian Conduct (ch.3)
<dd>(C.) Produces Obedience to the Will of God (ch.4)<dt>
<dt><b><i>2:1 Wherefore laying aside all malice, and all guile, <br>and hypocrisies, and envies, and all evil speakings,<br>
2:2 As newborn babes, desire the sincere milk of the word, that ye may grow thereby:<br>
2:3 If so be </b></i>{since}<i><b> ye have tasted that the Lord [is] gracious.</i></b></dt><dl>
<dt>Wherefore...- ie., in keeping with your new birth by the Word of God, 
<dd>and your obedience ''through the Spirit unto unfeigned love of the brethren.'' (<a href="1pet1.htm#22">1:22,23</a>)
<dt>laying aside...- (cp. <a href="eph4.htm#22">Eph 4:22-25</a>; <a href="1cor5.htm#7">1Cor 5:7,8</a>)-
<dd>We are to <i>separate from all evil</i> which would corrupt our relationships with our brothers. eg.,<ul>
<li>all malice- congealed anger, an unforgiving spirit, ill-will, a desire to injure another.
<li>all guile- deceitfulness, fleshly cleverness. (eg., <a href="act5.htm#1">Acts 5:1-4</a>)
<li>hypocrisies- pretentiousness. 
<li>envies- cp. <a href="php1.htm#15">Php 1:15</a>; <a href="jam4.htm#4">Jam 4:4,5</a>
<li>evil speakings- defamation, slander, backbiting.</ul>These things flow from the flesh, the 'corruptible seed.'<br>But the believer's new life flows from the Word of God (<a href="1pet1.htm#23">1:23</a>).<br>- - Contrast the progressive flow of <a href="1pet2.htm#1" target="lwr_lt">v.1</a> with <a href="2pet1.htm#4">2Pet 1:4-7</a>.
<dt>desire the sincere {ie., pure, unadulterated} milk of the Word.-
<dd>We are to <i>separate unto the Word</i> of God.
<dd>A baby is born with an appetite for milk. The new believer also hungers for spiritual nourishment. This appetite must not be neglected but fed and encouraged. A maturing believer will have a growing appetite for, and understanding of, the Word. The disregard of God's Word produces spiritual immaturity and famine. cp. <a href="1cor3.htm#2">1Cor 3:2,3</a>; <a href="heb5.htm#12">Heb 5:12-14</a>; <a href="amos8.htm#11">Amos 8:11-13</a>
<dt>if so be ye have tasted that the Lord is gracious- <a href="psa34.htm#8">Psa 34:8</a>
<dd>The believer's desire for the Word is linked to his desire to know the Lord. ''They are both precious to the renewed heart, for the Word reveals Him and His fulness to the soul.'' [GWms]

<dt>We are <i>separated unto Christ</i>, the 'Stone' rejected by others.
<dt>The Lord Jesus Christ is the Stone {Rock}. cp. <a href="deu32.htm#3">Deu 32:3,4</a>; <a href="1cor10.htm#4">1Cor 10:4</a>
<dd>A. He is the chief cornerstone. <a href="1pet2.htm#5" target="lwr_lt">v.5,6</a>; <a href="isa28.htm#16">Isa 28:16</a>; <a href="1cor3.htm#11">1Cor 3:11</a><ul>
<li>The 'spiritual house' (ie., the Church of true believers) -<br>
- - is built upon Him. <a href="mat16.htm#16">Mat 16:16-18</a> (Not Peter, but the One whom Peter confessed.); <a href="eph2.htm#19">Eph 2:19-22</a><br>
- - is built up of believers, who are 'living stones,' since His life is in them.<br>Yet, every believer is inferior to Him. Peter's words, here, show that he understood his place as a 'little stone' built upon Christ, the foundation. (See <a href="mat16an.htm#15" target="lwr_lt">note at Mat 16:16-18</a>)
<li>He is 'precious' {of great value} to those who believe in Him. <a href="1pet2.htm#7" target="lwr_lt">v.7</a></ul>
<dd>B. He is the Stone disallowed {rejected} of men. <a href="1pet2.htm#4" target="lwr_lt">v.4,7</a>; <a href="psa118.htm#22">Psa 118:22</a><br>
Unbelievers disregard Him as-<ul>
<li>a stone of stumbling- cp. <a href="rom9.htm#31">Rom 9:31-33</a>; <a href="1cor1.htm#23">1Cor 1:23,24</a>
<li>a rock of offense {GK=skandalon, a snare} - cp. <a href="isa8.htm#14">Isa 8:14</a>; eg., <a href="mar14.htm#61">Mark 14:61-63</a><br>
Yet, they will see Him exalted to the place of highest honor ('the headstone'). <br>cp. <a href="mat21.htm#37">Mat 21:37-44</a>; <a href="mat21an.htm#stone" target="lwr_lt">note at Mat 21:42-44</a></ul>

<i><b>2:9 But ye [are] a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, an holy nation, a peculiar people; <br>that ye should shew forth the praises of him <br>who hath called you out of darkness into his marvellous light:<br>
2:10 Which in time past [were] not a people, but [are] now the people of God: <br>which had not obtained mercy, but now have obtained mercy.</i></b></dt><dl>
<dt>We are <i>separated unto relationship with, and service to, the Lord</i> (in contrast to the 'disobedient,' <a href="1pet2.htm#8" target="lwr_lt">v.8</a>).<dd>Believers are -<ol type="A">
<li>a chosen generation- The Bible speaks of two groups of 'chosen' people:<ul>
<li><b>Israel-</b> <a href="1pet2.htm#9" target="lwr_lt">v.9,10</a> quote from <a href="ex19.htm#5">Ex 19:5,6</a>, which, as originally spoken to Israel, was a conditional promise (''if ye will obey... then...''). Because of unbelief, Israel did not fulfill their part, and was temporarily set aside. But their status as a 'chosen people' has not been revoked (<a href="rom11.htm#29">Rom 11:29</a>). Temporarily, they have become 'not my people,' but a remnant will be restored (cp. <a href="rom9.htm#23">Rom 9:23-27</a> which quotes <a href="hos1.htm#10">Hosea 1:10</a>; <a href="hos2.htm#23">2:23</a>).
<li><b>the Church-</b> During the period that Israel (for the most part) has been in unbelief, God has been calling out (from among both Jews and Gentiles) those who trust in Christ. <a href="eph2.htm#11">Eph 2:11-21</a>; cp. <a href="joh15.htm#16">Joh 15:16</a></ul>
<li>a royal priesthood- <ul>
<li>Israel (ie., all 12 tribes) was to have been a kingdom of priests. <a href="ex19.htm#2">Ex 19:2-6</a><br>
But due to national sin, God gave the priesthood exclusively to the tribe of Levi.<br>That priesthood rejected the Messiah at His first coming. Today, their 'house' (Temple) is desolate, and there is no active priesthood in the OT sense. However, in the earthly Kingdom of the Messiah, Israel will be restored to the priesthood. cp. <a href="isa61.htm#6">Isa 61:6</a>
<li>In the Church, every believer in Christ is a priest (<a href="rev1.htm#6">Rev 1:6</a>; <a href="rev5.htm#10">5:10</a>)-<ol type="a">
<li>who has access to God, because our High Priest has gone before us. <a href="heb10.htm#19">Heb 10:19-22</a>; cp. <a href="ex25.htm#22">Ex 25:22</a>
<li>who is to offer spiritual sacrifices (<a href="1pet2.htm#5" target="lwr_lt">v.5</a>), including-<ul>
<li>prayer, which God hears. cp. <a href="1pet3.htm#12">3:12</a>; <a href="col4.htm#12">Col 4:12</a>; <a href="1tim2.htm#1">1Tim 2:1</a><br>
<li>praise, worship toward God. <a href="heb13.htm#15">Heb 13:15</a><br>
<li>his own body for God's service. cp. <a href="rom12.htm#1">Rom 12:1</a>; <a href="jam1.htm#27">Jam 1:27</a>; <a href="1joh3.htm#16">1Joh 3:16</a><br>
<li>his material goods. <a href="rom12.htm#13">Rom 12:13</a>; <a href="gal6.htm#6">Gal 6:6,10</a> {'to communicate' means 'to share'}; <a href="heb13.htm#2">Heb 13:2,16</a>; <a href="3joh1.htm#5">3Joh 1:5-8</a></ul></ol></ul>
<li>an holy nation- Christ is our Righteousness; the Holy Spirit sanctifies us (<a href="1pet1.htm#2">1:2,15,16</a>).
<li>a peculiar people (ie., a people for His own possession)- <a href="joh6.htm#37">Joh 6:37</a>; <a href="joh17.htm#6">17:6</a><dd>See <a href="eph1.htm#14">Eph 1:14</a>, where the word for 'peculiar' (GK=peripoiesis) is translated: &quot;purchased possession.&quot;<dd>cp. <a href="psa144.htm#15">Psa 144:15</a>; <a href="psa79.htm#13">79:13</a>; <a href="isa53.htm#8">Isa 53:8</a>; <a href="heb13.htm#12">Heb 13:12-14</a><dt>
In time past, not my people- Christ, in mercy, calls His own out...<ul><li>from among the Jews (who were in a state of rebellion from Him, cp. <a href="hos1.htm#10">Hos 1:10,11</a>), and<li>from among the Gentiles (who were in ignorance of Him, <a href="rom9.htm#24">Rom 9:24-26</a>; <a href="eph2.htm#11">Eph 2:11-13</a>).<li>from the realm of darkness into His kingdom of light. <a href="col1.htm#12">Col 1:12-14</a></ul></ol></dl>
<dt><b><i>2:11 Dearly beloved, I beseech [you] as strangers and pilgrims, </b></i>{cp. <a href="1pet1.htm#1">1:1</a>; <a href="php3.htm#20">Php 3:20,21</a>; <a href="heb11.htm#13">Heb 11:13-16</a>}<i><b><br>abstain from fleshly lusts, which war against the soul; </b></i>{cp. <a href="rom8.htm#13">Rom 8:13</a>; <a href="gal5.htm#17">Gal 5:17</a>}<i><b><br>

<dt>Dearly beloved...- This is the first of 8 times, in his two short epistles, that Peter addresses his readers as 'beloved.'<dd>The apostle was not merely expressing his own affection, for these were &quot;beloved of God,&quot; because they were His very own purchased possessions (<a href="1pet2.htm#9" target="lwr_lt">v.9</a>; <a href="rom1.htm#7">Rom 1:7</a>; <a href="2the2.htm#13">2The 2:13</a>).<br>&quot;Beloved of God...&quot; What comfort to strangers and pilgrims in a hostile land... What privilege and responsibily: to represent the One, who loved me and gave Himself for me, before those who do not yet know God's love toward them.
<dt>The believer priest is to ''show forth the praises of God'' (<a href="1pet2.htm#9" target="lwr_lt">v.9</a>) before the unbelieving world-
<dd><b>A.</b> by good works. cp. <a href="1pet2.htm#12" target="lwr_lt">v.12</a>; <a href="mat5.htm#16">Mat 5:16</a>; <a href="tit2.htm#7">Titus 2:7,8</a><ul><li>Unbelievers may oppose your stand for Christ now, but in the 'day of visitation' {GK=episkope, inspection}, when God examines the lives of men, they will have nothing to speak against you, and perhaps some of them will praise God because the testimony of your life led them to the Savior.
<li>The ''day of visitation'' (<a href="1pet2.htm#12" target="lwr_lt">v.12</a>) may also apply to the context of governmental justice (v.13-16).<br>''If so, the passage may be thus read: 'Whereas they (your accusers) accuse you as evil-doers, they (the magistrates) may on the evidence of your good works which will be placed before them, pronounce you innocent; and their verdict will, in effect, glorify God and nullify the ignorant accusations of malicious and foolish accusers.''
