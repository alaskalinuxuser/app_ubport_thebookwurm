Psalms  41<br> 1. To the chief Musician, A Psalm of David. Blessed [is] he that considereth the poor: the LORD will deliver him in time of trouble.<br><a name="2">2</a>  The LORD will preserve him, and keep him alive; [and] he shall be blessed upon the earth: and thou wilt not deliver him unto the will of his enemies.<br><a name="3">3</a>  The LORD will strengthen him upon the bed of languishing: thou wilt make all his bed in his sickness.<br><a name="4">4</a>  I said, LORD, be merciful unto me: heal my soul; for I have sinned against thee.<br><a name="5">5</a>. Mine enemies speak evil of me, When shall he die, and his name perish?<br><a name="6">6</a>  And if he come to see [me], he speaketh vanity: his heart gathereth iniquity to itself; [when] he goeth abroad, he telleth [it].<br><a name="7">7</a>  All that hate me whisper together against me: against me do they devise my hurt.<br><a name="8">8</a>  An evil disease, [say they], cleaveth fast unto him: and [now] that he lieth he shall rise up no more.<br><a name="9">9</a>  Yea, mine own familiar friend, in whom I trusted, which did eat of my bread, hath lifted up [his] heel against me.<br><a name="10">10</a>  But thou, O LORD, be merciful unto me, and raise me up, that I may requite them.<br><a name="11">11</a>  By this I know that thou favourest me, because mine enemy doth not triumph over me.<br><a name="12">12</a>  And as for me, thou upholdest me in mine integrity, and settest me before thy face for ever.<br><a name="13">13</a>  Blessed [be] the LORD God of Israel from everlasting, and to everlasting.
