2Corinthians  12<br> 1. It is not expedient for me doubtless to glory. I will come to visions and revelations of the Lord.<br><a name="2">2</a>  I knew a man in Christ above fourteen years ago, (whether in the body, I cannot tell; or whether out of the body, I cannot tell: God knoweth;) such an one caught up to the third heaven.<br><a name="3">3</a>  And I knew such a man, (whether in the body, or out of the body, I cannot tell: God knoweth;)<br><a name="4">4</a>  How that he was caught up into paradise, and heard unspeakable words, which it is not lawful for a man to utter.<br><a name="5">5</a>  Of such an one will I glory: yet of myself I will not glory, but in mine infirmities.<br><a name="6">6</a>  For though I would desire to glory, I shall not be a fool; for I will say the truth: but [now] I forbear, lest any man should think of me above that which he seeth me [to be], or [that] he heareth of me.<br><a name="7">7</a>  And lest I should be exalted above measure through the abundance of the revelations, there was given to me a thorn in the flesh, the messenger of Satan to buffet me, lest I should be exalted above measure.<br><a name="8">8</a>  For this thing I besought the Lord thrice, that it might depart from me.<br><a name="9">9</a>  And he said unto me, My grace is sufficient for thee: for my strength is made perfect in weakness. Most gladly therefore will I rather glory in my infirmities, that the power of Christ may rest upon me.<br><a name="10">10</a>  Therefore I take pleasure in infirmities, in reproaches, in necessities, in persecutions, in distresses for Christ's sake: for when I am weak, then am I strong.<br><a name="11">11</a>. I am become a fool in glorying; ye have compelled me: for I ought to have been commended of you: for in nothing am I behind the very chiefest apostles, though I be nothing.<br><a name="12">12</a>  Truly the signs of an apostle were wrought among you in all patience, in signs, and wonders, and mighty deeds.<br><a name="13">13</a>  For what is it wherein ye were inferior to other churches, except [it be] that I myself was not burdensome to you? forgive me this wrong.<br><a name="14">14</a>  Behold, the third time I am ready to come to you; and I will not be burdensome to you: for I seek not yours, but you: for the children ought not to lay up for the parents, but the parents for the children.<br><a name="15">15</a>  And I will very gladly spend and be spent for you; though the more abundantly I love you, the less I be loved.<br><a name="16">16</a>  But be it so, I did not burden you: nevertheless, being crafty, I caught you with guile.<br><a name="17">17</a>  Did I make a gain of you by any of them whom I sent unto you?<br><a name="18">18</a>  I desired Titus, and with [him] I sent a brother. Did Titus make a gain of you? walked we not in the same spirit? [walked we] not in the same steps?<br><a name="19">19</a>  Again, think ye that we excuse ourselves unto you? we speak before God in Christ: but [we do] all things, dearly beloved, for your edifying.<br><a name="20">20</a>  For I fear, lest, when I come, I shall not find you such as I would, and [that] I shall be found unto you such as ye would not: lest [there be] debates, envyings, wraths, strifes, backbitings, whisperings, swellings, tumults:<br><a name="21">21</a>  [And] lest, when I come again, my God will humble me among you, and [that] I shall bewail many which have sinned already, and have not repented of the uncleanness and fornication and lasciviousness which they have committed.<br><br>Go to <a href="2cor13.htm#1">II Corinthians 13</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
