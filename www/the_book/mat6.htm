Matthew   6<br> 1. Take heed that ye do not your alms before men, to be seen of them: otherwise ye have no reward of your Father which is in heaven.<br><a name="2">2</a>  Therefore when thou doest [thine] alms, do not sound a trumpet before thee, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets, that they may have glory of men. Verily I say unto you, They have their reward.<br><a name="3">3</a>  But when thou doest alms, let not thy left hand know what thy right hand doeth:<br><a name="4">4</a>  That thine alms may be in secret: and thy Father which seeth in secret himself shall reward thee openly.<br><a name="5">5</a>. And when thou prayest, thou shalt not be as the hypocrites [are]: for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and in the corners of the streets, that they may be seen of men. Verily I say unto you, They have their reward.<br><a name="6">6</a>  But thou, when thou prayest, enter into thy closet, and when thou hast shut thy door, pray to thy Father which is in secret; and thy Father which seeth in secret shall reward thee openly.<br><a name="7">7</a>  But when ye pray, use not vain repetitions, as the heathen [do]: for they think that they shall be heard for their much speaking.<br><a name="8">8</a>  Be not ye therefore like unto them: for your Father knoweth what things ye have need of, before ye ask him.<br><a name="9">9</a>. After this manner therefore pray ye: Our Father which art in heaven, Hallowed be thy name.<br><a name="10">10</a>  Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done in earth, as [it is] in heaven.<br><a name="11">11</a>  Give us this day our daily bread.<br><a name="12">12</a>  And forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors.<br><a name="13">13</a>  And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil: For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, for ever. Amen.<br><a name="14">14</a>  For if ye forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you:<br><a name="15">15</a>  But if ye forgive not men their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses.<br><a name="16">16</a>. Moreover when ye fast, be not, as the hypocrites, of a sad countenance: for they disfigure their faces, that they may appear unto men to fast. Verily I say unto you, They have their reward.<br><a name="17">17</a>  But thou, when thou fastest, anoint thine head, and wash thy face;<br><a name="18">18</a>  That thou appear not unto men to fast, but unto thy Father which is in secret: and thy Father, which seeth in secret, shall reward thee openly.<br><a name="19">19</a>. Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth, where moth and rust doth corrupt, and where thieves break through and steal:<br><a name="20">20</a>  But lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust doth corrupt, and where thieves do not break through nor steal:<br><a name="21">21</a>  For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.<br><a name="22">22</a>  The light of the body is the eye: if therefore thine eye be single, thy whole body shall be full of light.<br><a name="23">23</a>  But if thine eye be evil, thy whole body shall be full of darkness. If therefore the light that is in thee be darkness, how great [is] that darkness!<br><a name="24">24</a>  No man can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to the one, and despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon.<br><a name="25">25</a>. Therefore I say unto you, Take no thought for your life, what ye shall eat, or what ye shall drink; nor yet for your body, what ye shall put on. Is not the life more than meat, and the body than raiment?<br><a name="26">26</a>  Behold the fowls of the air: for they sow not, neither do they reap, nor gather into barns; yet your heavenly Father feedeth them. Are ye not much better than they?<br><a name="27">27</a>  Which of you by taking thought can add one cubit unto his stature?<br><a name="28">28</a>  And why take ye thought for raiment? Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow; they toil not, neither do they spin:<br><a name="29">29</a>  And yet I say unto you, That even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these.<br><a name="30">30</a>  Wherefore, if God so clothe the grass of the field, which to day is, and to morrow is cast into the oven, [shall he] not much more [clothe] you, O ye of little faith?<br><a name="31">31</a>  Therefore take no thought, saying, What shall we eat? or, What shall we drink? or, Wherewithal shall we be clothed?<br><a name="32">32</a>  (For after all these things do the Gentiles seek:) for your heavenly Father knoweth that ye have need of all these things.<br><a name="33">33</a>  But seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you.<br><a name="34">34</a>  Take therefore no thought for the morrow: for the morrow shall take thought for the things of itself. Sufficient unto the day [is] the evil thereof.<br><br>Go to <a href="mat7.htm#1">Matthew 7</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
