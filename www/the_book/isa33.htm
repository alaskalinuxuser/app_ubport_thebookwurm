Isaiah  33<br> 1. Woe to thee that spoilest, and thou [wast] not spoiled; and dealest treacherously, and they dealt not treacherously with thee! when thou shalt cease to spoil, thou shalt be spoiled; [and] when thou shalt make an end to deal treacherously, they shall deal treacherously with thee.<br><a name="2">2</a>  O LORD, be gracious unto us; we have waited for thee: be thou their arm every morning, our salvation also in the time of trouble.<br><a name="3">3</a>  At the noise of the tumult the people fled; at the lifting up of thyself the nations were scattered.<br><a name="4">4</a>  And your spoil shall be gathered [like] the gathering of the caterpiller: as the running to and fro of locusts shall he run upon them.<br><a name="5">5</a>  The LORD is exalted; for he dwelleth on high: he hath filled Zion with judgment and righteousness.<br><a name="6">6</a>  And wisdom and knowledge shall be the stability of thy times, [and] strength of salvation: the fear of the LORD [is] his treasure.<br><a name="7">7</a>  Behold, their valiant ones shall cry without: the ambassadors of peace shall weep bitterly.<br><a name="8">8</a>  The highways lie waste, the wayfaring man ceaseth: he hath broken the covenant, he hath despised the cities, he regardeth no man.<br><a name="9">9</a>  The earth mourneth [and] languisheth: Lebanon is ashamed [and] hewn down: Sharon is like a wilderness; and Bashan and Carmel shake off [their fruits].<br><a name="10">10</a>  Now will I rise, saith the LORD; now will I be exalted; now will I lift up myself.<br><a name="11">11</a>  Ye shall conceive chaff, ye shall bring forth stubble: your breath, [as] fire, shall devour you.<br><a name="12">12</a>  And the people shall be [as] the burnings of lime: [as] thorns cut up shall they be burned in the fire.<br><a name="13">13</a>. Hear, ye [that are] far off, what I have done; and, ye [that are] near, acknowledge my might.<br><a name="14">14</a>  The sinners in Zion are afraid; fearfulness hath surprised the hypocrites. Who among us shall dwell with the devouring fire? who among us shall dwell with everlasting burnings?<br><a name="15">15</a>  He that walketh righteously, and speaketh uprightly; he that despiseth the gain of oppressions, that shaketh his hands from holding of bribes, that stoppeth his ears from hearing of blood, and shutteth his eyes from seeing evil;<br><a name="16">16</a>  He shall dwell on high: his place of defence [shall be] the munitions of rocks: bread shall be given him; his waters [shall be] sure.<br><a name="17">17</a>  Thine eyes shall see the king in his beauty: they shall behold the land that is very far off.<br><a name="18">18</a>  Thine heart shall meditate terror. Where [is] the scribe? where [is] the receiver? where [is] he that counted the towers?<br><a name="19">19</a>  Thou shalt not see a fierce people, a people of a deeper speech than thou canst perceive; of a stammering tongue, [that thou canst] not understand.<br><a name="20">20</a>  Look upon Zion, the city of our solemnities: thine eyes shall see Jerusalem a quiet habitation, a tabernacle [that] shall not be taken down; not one of the stakes thereof shall ever be removed, neither shall any of the cords thereof be broken.<br><a name="21">21</a>  But there the glorious LORD [will be] unto us a place of broad rivers [and] streams; wherein shall go no galley with oars, neither shall gallant ship pass thereby.<br><a name="22">22</a>  For the LORD [is] our judge, the LORD [is] our lawgiver, the LORD [is] our king; he will save us.<br><a name="23">23</a>  Thy tacklings are loosed; they could not well strengthen their mast, they could not spread the sail: then is the prey of a great spoil divided; the lame take the prey.<br><a name="24">24</a>  And the inhabitant shall not say, I am sick: the people that dwell therein [shall be] forgiven [their] iniquity.<br><br>Go to <a href="isa34.htm#1">Isaiah 34</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
