Proverbs  25<br>1. These [are] also proverbs of Solomon, which the men of Hezekiah king of Judah copied out.<br><a name="2">2</a>. [It is] the glory of God to conceal a thing: but the honour of kings [is] to search out a matter.<br><a name="3">3</a>  The heaven for height, and the earth for depth, and the heart of kings [is] unsearchable.<br><a name="4">4</a>. Take away the dross from the silver, and there shall come forth a vessel for the finer.<br><a name="5">5</a>  Take away the wicked [from] before the king, and his throne shall be established in righteousness.<br><a name="6">6</a>. Put not forth thyself in the presence of the king, and stand not in the place of great [men]:<br><a name="7">7</a>  For better [it is] that it be said unto thee, Come up hither; than that thou shouldest be put lower in the presence of the prince whom thine eyes have seen.<br><a name="8">8</a>. Go not forth hastily to strive, lest [thou know not] what to do in the end thereof, when thy neighbour hath put thee to shame.<br><a name="9">9</a>  Debate thy cause with thy neighbour [himself]; and discover not a secret to another:<br><a name="10">10</a>  Lest he that heareth [it] put thee to shame, and thine infamy turn not away.<br><a name="11">11</a>. A word fitly spoken [is like] apples of gold in pictures of silver.<br><a name="12">12</a>  [As] an earring of gold, and an ornament of fine gold, [so is] a wise reprover upon an obedient ear.<br><a name="13">13</a>. As the cold of snow in the time of harvest, [so is] a faithful messenger to them that send him: for he refresheth the soul of his masters.<br><a name="14">14</a>. Whoso boasteth himself of a false gift [is like] clouds and wind without rain.<br><a name="15">15</a>. By long forbearing is a prince persuaded, and a soft tongue breaketh the bone.<br><a name="16">16</a>. Hast thou found honey? eat so much as is sufficient for thee, lest thou be filled therewith, and vomit it.<br><a name="17">17</a>. Withdraw thy foot from thy neighbour's house; lest he be weary of thee, and [so] hate thee.<br><a name="18">18</a>. A man that beareth false witness against his neighbour [is] a maul, and a sword, and a sharp arrow.<br><a name="19">19</a>. Confidence in an unfaithful man in time of trouble [is like] a broken tooth, and a foot out of joint.<br><a name="20">20</a>. [As] he that taketh away a garment in cold weather, [and as] vinegar upon nitre, so [is] he that singeth songs to an heavy heart.<br><a name="21">21</a>. If thine enemy be hungry, give him bread to eat; and if he be thirsty, give him water to drink:<br><a name="22">22</a>  For thou shalt heap coals of fire upon his head, and the LORD shall reward thee.<br><a name="23">23</a>. The north wind driveth away rain: so [doth] an angry countenance a backbiting tongue.<br><a name="24">24</a>. [It is] better to dwell in the corner of the housetop, than with a brawling woman and in a wide house.<br><a name="25">25</a>. [As] cold waters to a thirsty soul, so [is] good news from a far country.<br><a name="26">26</a>. A righteous man falling down before the wicked [is as] a troubled fountain, and a corrupt spring.<br><a name="27">27</a>. [It is] not good to eat much honey: so [for men] to search their own glory [is not] glory.<br><a name="28">28</a>. He that [hath] no rule over his own spirit [is like] a city [that is] broken down, [and] without walls.<br><br>Go to <a href="pro26.htm#1">Proverbs 26</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
