Proverbs   1<br>1. The proverbs of Solomon the son of David, king of Israel;<br><a name="2">2</a>  To know wisdom and instruction; to perceive the words of understanding;<br><a name="3">3</a>  To receive the instruction of wisdom, justice, and judgment, and equity;<br><a name="4">4</a>  To give subtilty to the simple, to the young man knowledge and discretion.<br><a name="5">5</a>  A wise [man] will hear, and will increase learning; and a man of understanding shall attain unto wise counsels:<br><a name="6">6</a>  To understand a proverb, and the interpretation; the words of the wise, and their dark sayings.<br><a name="7">7</a>. The fear of the LORD [is] the beginning of knowledge: [but] fools despise wisdom and instruction.<br><a name="8">8</a>  My son, hear the instruction of thy father, and forsake not the law of thy mother:<br><a name="9">9</a>  For they [shall be] an ornament of grace unto thy head, and chains about thy neck.<br><a name="10">10</a>. My son, if sinners entice thee, consent thou not.<br><a name="11">11</a>  If they say, Come with us, let us lay wait for blood, let us lurk privily for the innocent without cause:<br><a name="12">12</a>  Let us swallow them up alive as the grave; and whole, as those that go down into the pit:<br><a name="13">13</a>  We shall find all precious substance, we shall fill our houses with spoil:<br><a name="14">14</a>  Cast in thy lot among us; let us all have one purse:<br><a name="15">15</a>  My son, walk not thou in the way with them; refrain thy foot from their path:<br><a name="16">16</a>  For their feet run to evil, and make haste to shed blood.<br><a name="17">17</a>  Surely in vain the net is spread in the sight of any bird.<br><a name="18">18</a>  And they lay wait for their [own] blood; they lurk privily for their [own] lives.<br><a name="19">19</a>  So [are] the ways of every one that is greedy of gain; [which] taketh away the life of the owners thereof.<br><a name="20">20</a>. Wisdom crieth without; she uttereth her voice in the streets:<br><a name="21">21</a>  She crieth in the chief place of concourse, in the openings of the gates: in the city she uttereth her words, [saying],<br><a name="22">22</a>  How long, ye simple ones, will ye love simplicity? and the scorners delight in their scorning, and fools hate knowledge?<br><a name="23">23</a>  Turn you at my reproof: behold, I will pour out my spirit unto you, I will make known my words unto you.<br><a name="24">24</a>  Because I have called, and ye refused; I have stretched out my hand, and no man regarded;<br><a name="25">25</a>  But ye have set at nought all my counsel, and would none of my reproof:<br><a name="26">26</a>  I also will laugh at your calamity; I will mock when your fear cometh;<br><a name="27">27</a>  When your fear cometh as desolation, and your destruction cometh as a whirlwind; when distress and anguish cometh upon you.<br><a name="28">28</a>  Then shall they call upon me, but I will not answer; they shall seek me early, but they shall not find me:<br><a name="29">29</a>  For that they hated knowledge, and did not choose the fear of the LORD:<br><a name="30">30</a>  They would none of my counsel: they despised all my reproof.<br><a name="31">31</a>  Therefore shall they eat of the fruit of their own way, and be filled with their own devices.<br><a name="32">32</a>  For the turning away of the simple shall slay them, and the prosperity of fools shall destroy them.<br><a name="33">33</a>  But whoso hearkeneth unto me shall dwell safely, and shall be quiet from fear of evil.<br><br>Go to <a href="pro2.htm#1">Proverbs 2</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
