Genesis  35<br> 1. And God said unto Jacob, Arise, go up to Bethel, and dwell there: and make there an altar unto God, that appeared unto thee when thou fleddest from the face of Esau thy brother.<br><a name="2">2</a>  Then Jacob said unto his household, and to all that [were] with him, Put away the strange gods that [are] among you, and be clean, and change your garments:<br><a name="3">3</a>  And let us arise, and go up to Bethel; and I will make there an altar unto God, who answered me in the day of my distress, and was with me in the way which I went.<br><a name="4">4</a>  And they gave unto Jacob all the strange gods which [were] in their hand, and [all their] earrings which [were] in their ears; and Jacob hid them under the oak which [was] by Shechem.<br><a name="5">5</a>  And they journeyed: and the terror of God was upon the cities that [were] round about them, and they did not pursue after the sons of Jacob.<br><a name="6">6</a>. So Jacob came to Luz, which [is] in the land of Canaan, that [is], Bethel, he and all the people that [were] with him.<br><a name="7">7</a>  And he built there an altar, and called the place Elbethel: because there God appeared unto him, when he fled from the face of his brother.<br><a name="8">8</a>  But Deborah Rebekah's nurse died, and she was buried beneath Bethel under an oak: and the name of it was called Allonbachuth.<br><a name="9">9</a>  And God appeared unto Jacob again, when he came out of Padanaram, and blessed him.<br><a name="10">10</a>  And God said unto him, Thy name [is] Jacob: thy name shall not be called any more Jacob, but Israel shall be thy name: and he called his name Israel.<br><a name="11">11</a>  And God said unto him, I [am] God Almighty: be fruitful and multiply; a nation and a company of nations shall be of thee, and kings shall come out of thy loins;<br><a name="12">12</a>  And the land which I gave Abraham and Isaac, to thee I will give it, and to thy seed after thee will I give the land.<br><a name="13">13</a>  And God went up from him in the place where he talked with him.<br><a name="14">14</a>  And Jacob set up a pillar in the place where he talked with him, [even] a pillar of stone: and he poured a drink offering thereon, and he poured oil thereon.<br><a name="15">15</a>  And Jacob called the name of the place where God spake with him, Bethel.<br><a name="16">16</a>. And they journeyed from Bethel; and there was but a little way to come to Ephrath: and Rachel travailed, and she had hard labour.<br><a name="17">17</a>  And it came to pass, when she was in hard labour, that the midwife said unto her, Fear not; thou shalt have this son also.<br><a name="18">18</a>  And it came to pass, as her soul was in departing, (for she died) that she called his name Benoni: but his father called him Benjamin.<br><a name="19">19</a>  And Rachel died, and was buried in the way to Ephrath, which [is] Bethlehem.<br><a name="20">20</a>  And Jacob set a pillar upon her grave: that [is] the pillar of Rachel's grave unto this day.<br><a name="21">21</a>. And Israel journeyed, and spread his tent beyond the tower of Edar.<br><a name="22">22</a>  And it came to pass, when Israel dwelt in that land, that Reuben went and lay with Bilhah his father's concubine: and Israel heard [it]. Now the sons of Jacob were twelve:<br><a name="23">23</a>  The sons of Leah; Reuben, Jacob's firstborn, and Simeon, and Levi, and Judah, and Issachar, and Zebulun:<br><a name="24">24</a>  The sons of Rachel; Joseph, and Benjamin:<br><a name="25">25</a>  And the sons of Bilhah, Rachel's handmaid; Dan, and Naphtali:<br><a name="26">26</a>  And the sons of Zilpah, Leah's handmaid; Gad, and Asher: these [are] the sons of Jacob, which were born to him in Padanaram.<br><a name="27">27</a>  And Jacob came unto Isaac his father unto Mamre, unto the city of Arbah, which [is] Hebron, where Abraham and Isaac sojourned.<br><a name="28">28</a>  And the days of Isaac were an hundred and fourscore years.<br><a name="29">29</a>  And Isaac gave up the ghost, and died, and was gathered unto his people, [being] old and full of days: and his sons Esau and Jacob buried him.<br><br>Go to <a href="gen36.htm#1">Genesis 36</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
