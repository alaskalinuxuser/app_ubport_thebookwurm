Proverbs   3<br> 1. My son, forget not my law; but let thine heart keep my commandments:<br><a name="2">2</a>  For length of days, and long life, and peace, shall they add to thee.<br><a name="3">3</a>  Let not mercy and truth forsake thee: bind them about thy neck; write them upon the table of thine heart:<br><a name="4">4</a>  So shalt thou find favour and good understanding in the sight of God and man.<br><a name="5">5</a>  Trust in the LORD with all thine heart; and lean not unto thine own understanding.<br><a name="6">6</a>  In all thy ways acknowledge him, and he shall direct thy paths.<br><a name="7">7</a>. Be not wise in thine own eyes: fear the LORD, and depart from evil.<br><a name="8">8</a>  It shall be health to thy navel, and marrow to thy bones.<br><a name="9">9</a>  Honour the LORD with thy substance, and with the firstfruits of all thine increase:<br><a name="10">10</a>  So shall thy barns be filled with plenty, and thy presses shall burst out with new wine.<br><a name="11">11</a>  My son, despise not the chastening of the LORD; neither be weary of his correction:<br><a name="12">12</a>  For whom the LORD loveth he correcteth; even as a father the son [in whom] he delighteth.<br><a name="13">13</a>. Happy [is] the man [that] findeth wisdom, and the man [that] getteth understanding.<br><a name="14">14</a>  For the merchandise of it [is] better than the merchandise of silver, and the gain thereof than fine gold.<br><a name="15">15</a>  She [is] more precious than rubies: and all the things thou canst desire are not to be compared unto her.<br><a name="16">16</a>  Length of days [is] in her right hand; [and] in her left hand riches and honour.<br><a name="17">17</a>  Her ways [are] ways of pleasantness, and all her paths [are] peace.<br><a name="18">18</a>  She [is] a tree of life to them that lay hold upon her: and happy [is every one] that retaineth her.<br><a name="19">19</a>  The LORD by wisdom hath founded the earth; by understanding hath he established the heavens.<br><a name="20">20</a>  By his knowledge the depths are broken up, and the clouds drop down the dew.<br><a name="21">21</a>. My son, let not them depart from thine eyes: keep sound wisdom and discretion:<br><a name="22">22</a>  So shall they be life unto thy soul, and grace to thy neck.<br><a name="23">23</a>  Then shalt thou walk in thy way safely, and thy foot shall not stumble.<br><a name="24">24</a>  When thou liest down, thou shalt not be afraid: yea, thou shalt lie down, and thy sleep shall be sweet.<br><a name="25">25</a>  Be not afraid of sudden fear, neither of the desolation of the wicked, when it cometh.<br><a name="26">26</a>  For the LORD shall be thy confidence, and shall keep thy foot from being taken.<br><a name="27">27</a>. Withhold not good from them to whom it is due, when it is in the power of thine hand to do [it].<br><a name="28">28</a>  Say not unto thy neighbour, Go, and come again, and to morrow I will give; when thou hast it by thee.<br><a name="29">29</a>  Devise not evil against thy neighbour, seeing he dwelleth securely by thee.<br><a name="30">30</a>  Strive not with a man without cause, if he have done thee no harm.<br><a name="31">31</a>  Envy thou not the oppressor, and choose none of his ways.<br><a name="32">32</a>  For the froward [is] abomination to the LORD: but his secret [is] with the righteous.<br><a name="33">33</a>  The curse of the LORD [is] in the house of the wicked: but he blesseth the habitation of the just.<br><a name="34">34</a>  Surely he scorneth the scorners: but he giveth grace unto the lowly.<br><a name="35">35</a>  The wise shall inherit glory: but shame shall be the promotion of fools.<br><br>Go to <a href="pro4.htm#1">Proverbs 4</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
