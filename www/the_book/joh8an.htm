<dl><dt>
<dd>The account of 'the woman taken in adultery' (John 7:53 - 8:11) is not included in some ancient manuscripts. According to Augustine, it was omitted from some copies for fear that it would encourage adultery. However, in this passage, sin is condemned, not condoned. The account seems to fit well in the context, and provides the transition to Jesus' declaration and discourse on 'the light of the world' (which begins in <a href="joh8.htm#12" target="lwr_lt">v.12</a>).<dt>
<b><i>7:53  And every man went unto his own house.<br>
8:1 Jesus went unto the mount of Olives.<br>
8:2  And early in the morning he came again into the temple,<br>
and all the people came unto him; and he sat down, and taught them.</i></b></dt><dl>
<dt>in the morning- ie., on the eighth day of the feast of Tabernacles.<dd>This day was regarded as a sabbath. It was a day to consider the significance of the celebrations just concluded. <a href="lev23.htm#33">Lev 23:33-36</a>
<dt>Jesus... taught...- cp. <a href="joh7.htm#14">7:14-18</a>; <a href="luk21.htm#37">Luk 21:37,38</a><dt>
<dt>Suddenly, the solemnity of the sabbath is broken by a commotion. Excited voices grow louder as a group of religious leaders approaches. They are dragging a woman... her clothes in disarray... hair disheveled... defiant and resisting. The Teacher's words are interrupted. His hearers stare at the humiliated woman.</dl><dt>
<b><i>8:3  And the scribes and Pharisees brought unto him a woman taken in adultery;<br>
and when they had set her in the midst,<br>
8:4  They say unto him, Master, this woman was taken in adultery, in the very act.<br>
8:5  Now Moses in the law commanded us, that such should be stoned:<br>
but what sayest thou?</i></b> {cp. <a href="mat5.htm#17">Mat 5:17,27-32</a>}<i><b><br>
8:6  This they said, tempting him, that they might have to accuse him.<br>
But Jesus stooped down, and with [his] finger wrote on the ground,<br>
[as though he heard them not].</i></b></dt><dl>
<dt>Master...- ie., teacher. They address Him respectfully.
<dd>But they have no desire to hear His teaching (as demonstrated by their interruption).
<dt>tempting him... to accuse him- 'tempt' is GK= peirazo, test, tempt, prove.
<dd>One can test something to ascertain its worth. But they had already pre-judged Him (<a href="joh7.htm#47">7:47-52</a>).
<dd>Their intention is to discredit Him.
<dd>&quot;If He condemned her, He would lose favor with the common people. If He did not, He would be disagreeing with Moses.&quot; [TBKC]
<dt>Moses in the law...- condemned<i> both </i>adulterer and adulteress to death. <a href="lev20.htm#10">Lev 20:10</a>; <a href="deu22.htm#22">Deu 22:22</a>
<dd>The absence of the man indicates that their intent was not enforcement of the law (<a href="joh8.htm#4" target="lwr_lt">v.4</a>).
<dd>&quot;They didn't really want to stone the woman. They wanted to stone Him.&quot; [McGee]
<dt>as though He heard them not...- <dd>&quot;In effect, He dismisses the case. He will not join with her accusers.<br>He will not so much as look at her to add to her embarrassment.&quot; [McGee]</dl><dt>
<b><i>8:7  So when they continued asking him, he lifted up himself, and said unto them,<br>
He that is without sin among you, let him first cast a stone at her.<br>
8:8  And again he stooped down, and wrote on the ground.</i></b></dt><dl>
<dt>He... wrote on the ground.- This is the only record of Jesus' writing.
<dd>The scriptures record three occasions when something was written by the finger(s) of God.-<ol type="a"><li>The Law in stone- the standard of righteousness and judgment. <a href="ex31.htm#18">Ex 31:18</a>; <a href="deu9.htm#10">Deu 9:10</a><li>A sentence on a wall- an announcement of impending judgment. <a href="dan5.htm#5">Dan 5:5,25-28</a><li>Jesus' writing in the dust of the temple floor- a catalyst of conviction. (<a href="joh8.htm#9" target="lwr_lt">v.9</a>).<br>Would He have doodled or made meaningless marks? cp. <a href="joh5.htm#19">5:19</a>; <a href="joh7.htm#16">7:16</a><br>Surely His written words would sharply discern between righteousness and sin. cp. <a href="heb4.htm#12">Heb 4:12</a></ol>
<dt>We are not told what Jesus wrote. Therefore, any suggestion is speculation.
<dd>However, <a href="jer17.htm#13">Jer 17:13</a> seems particularly applicable to these men who had 'forsaken the Lord, the fountain of living waters.' (<a href="joh7.htm#37">7:37-38</a>)
<dd>Note that He wrote on the ground twice (v.6,8).<ul><li>Perhaps in <a href="joh8.htm#6" target="lwr_lt">v.6</a>, He wrote a list of specific sins. (cp. <a href="jer17.htm#1">Jer 17:1</a>)<br>or, a list of reminders to hidden sins. (eg., a woman's name, an address, or a date [McGee])<li>Perhaps in <a href="joh8.htm#8" target="lwr_lt">v.8</a>, He began matching each man's name to some hidden sin. <a href="jer17.htm#9">Jer 17:9,10</a>; <a href="psa90.htm#8">Psa 90:8</a><li>That these words were written in dust, and would soon be wiped out, was a mercy.<br>The final verdict awaits each man at the future day of judgment.</ul>
<dt>He that is without sin...- They came to 'tempt' Him. He put them to the test.
<dd>If the prerequisite for a judge is sinlessness, all men are disqualified. <a href="mat7.htm#1">Mat 7:1-5</a>; <a href="rom2.htm#1">Rom 2:1,22</a></dl><dt>
<b><i>8:9  And they which heard [it], being convicted by [their own] conscience,<br>
went out one by one, beginning at the eldest, [even] unto the last:<br>
and Jesus was left alone, and the woman standing in the midst.<br>
8:10  When Jesus had lifted up himself, and saw none but the woman,<br>
he said unto her, Woman, where are those thine accusers?<br>
hath no man condemned thee?<br>
8:11  She said, No man, Lord.<br>
And Jesus said unto her, Neither do I condemn thee:<br>
go, and sin no more.</i></b></dt><dl>
<dt>Jesus... alone- Only He was qualified to cast a stone (<a href="joh8.htm#7" target="lwr_lt">v.7</a> with <a href="joh8.htm#46" target="lwr_lt">v.46</a>). 
<dt>hath no man condemned thee?- <dd>&quot;Without accusers or witnesses, the [human] case is dropped.&quot; [TBKC]
<dd>But the fact remains that she is guilty of adultery.
<dt>neither do I condemn thee...- <dd>&quot;Is Jesus reversing the Mosaic system? No.<br>
He is placing His cross between that woman and her sin. This One who is the Son of the virgin, who Himself was under a cloud [of illegitimacy] all of His life, is going to the cross to pay the penalty for even the sin of this woman.&quot; [McGee] <a href="joh1.htm#29">John 1:29</a><br>&quot;He who read her heart must have known that she believed in Him. <a href="joh3.htm#16">John 3:16-18</a>&quot; [GWms] cp. <a href="rom8.htm#34">Rom 8:34</a>
<dt>go and sin no more.- How was this sinner to live without sinning?
<dd>By the water of life. The same provision was made for another adulteress. cp. <a href="joh4.htm#14">4:14,24</a>; <a href="joh7.htm#37">7:37-39</a>
<dd>Christ delivers believers from the penalty for sin,<i> and </i>from the power of sin over our lives.
<dt>they... being convicted... went out...- 
<dd> They departed from Him &quot;each caring for character rather than conscience,<br>
he who had the most reputation to save being the first to retire.&quot; [GWms]
<dd>Having been convicted, they were repelled by the Light.
<dd>Had they stayed and confessed, they also would have found forgiveness in the Savior. <a href="jer17.htm#14">Jer 17:14</a><br>Then, their names would have been written in heaven. <a href="luk10.htm#20">Luk 10:20</a>; <a href="heb12.htm#23">Heb 12:23</a>
<dt><dd>Later, that same day, He gave them another opportunity:</dl><dt>
<b><i>8:12  Then spake Jesus again unto them, saying,<br>
I am the light of the world:<br>
he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness,<br>
but shall have the light of life.</i></b></dt><dl>

<dt>the light of the world- 'the' light (not 'a' light). 
<dd>In the OT, this expression refers to the LORD and His Messiah.<br>See <a href="isa49.htm#6">Isa 49:6,9</a>; <a href="isa50.htm#10">50:10</a>; <a href="isa60.htm#1">60:1-3</a>; <a href="mal4.htm#2">Mal 4:2</a>; cp. <a href="luk1.htm#77">Luk 1:77-79</a>; <a href="1joh1.htm#5">1Joh 1:5</a>
<dt>the light of life...-<ul><li>reveals man's sinful condition (darkness) which leads to death. <a href="joh3.htm#19">Joh 3:19</a>
<li>reveals God's remedy for sin, the Savior who leads His followers into life. <a href="joh1.htm#4">1:4,5</a>; <a href="joh12.htm#46">12:46</a>; <a href="1joh1.htm#6">1Joh 1:6,7</a>
<dd>Jesus had acted as light, when He exposed the sin of the religious leaders (<a href="joh8.htm#9" target="lwr_lt">v.9</a>).</dd></ul>
<dt>he that follows me...- To 'follow' Him is to trust in Him and obey Him. <a href="joh10.htm#27">10:27,28</a>; <a href="joh12.htm#26">12:26</a></dl><dt>
<b><i>8:13  The Pharisees therefore said unto him,<br>

<dt>my record is true - Even without corroborating human witnesses, Jesus testimony is reliable.-<ol type="1">
<li>He knew the truth concerning His origins (<a href="joh8.htm#14" target="lwr_lt">v.14</a>).<dd>They were incompetent to judge Him. <a href="joh7.htm#28">7:28,29,33,34</a></dd>
<li>His judgment was not according to the flesh (<a href="joh8.htm#15" target="lwr_lt">v.15</a>). cp. <a href="joh7.htm#24">7:24</a><dd>
(judge- GK= krino, to judge, to condemn, to make a determination of a matter)<br>
Whatever judgments He made were in harmony with His Father's mind. <a href="joh5.htm#19">5:19,22,30</a><br>
God's Law is perfect, His knowledge is complete, and His interpretation is just.</dd>
<li>He was endorsed by the Father (<a href="joh8.htm#17" target="lwr_lt">v.17,18</a>). cp. <a href="joh5.htm#37">5:37</a></ol>
<dt>I judge no man-  The context, here, focuses on His method of judgment (<a href="joh8.htm#15" target="lwr_lt">v.15</a>).
<dd>It is also true that at His first coming, His mission was not to judge, but to save. <a href="joh8.htm#11" target="lwr_lt">v.11</a>; <a href="joh3.htm#17">3:17</a>
<dd>At His second coming, He will exercise judgment according to God's Word. <a href="joh5.htm#27">5:27-29,45</a></dl><a name="19"></a><dt>
<b><i>8:19  Then said they unto him, Where is thy Father?</i></b></dt><dl>
<dt>Their questions (see also <a href="joh8.htm#25" target="lwr_lt">v.25</a>,<a href="joh8.htm#53" target="lwr_lt">53</a>) reveal their darkness and blindness concerning Him,<dd>even while exposed to the light of His presence. cp. <a href="2cor4.htm#4">2Cor 4:4-6</a>
<dt>The discussion, in ch.8, reflects the conflict between spiritual Light and darkness.
<dd><a href="joh8ac.htm" target="upper">A chart</a>, contrasting these two sides, may make the argument of this chapter easier to grasp.</dl><dt>
<i><b>Jesus answered, Ye neither know me, nor my Father: </i></b> {<a href="joh8.htm#55" target="lwr_lt">v.55</a>}<br>
<i><b>if ye had known me, ye should have known my Father also.</i></b> {cp. <a href="joh14.htm#7">14:7-9</a>; <a href="luk10.htm#21">Luk 10:21,22</a>}<br>
<b><i>8:20  These words spake Jesus in the treasury, as he taught in the temple:<br>
and no man laid hands on him; for his hour was not yet come.</i></b></dt><dl>
<dt>the treasury- was located in 'the court of the women' (cp. <a href="joh8.htm#3" target="lwr_lt">v.3</a>; <a href="mar12.htm#41">Mark 12:41-42</a>).
<dd>This courtyard was the location of four huge lampstands which brightly illuminated the temple area during the feast of Tabernacles (in second Temple times). Priests used ladders to replenish the four large oil burning lamps which topped each lampstand. <dd>These lamps reminded Israel of the pillar of fire which went before them in the wilderness (as a visible manifestation of the Lord's presence, <a href="ex13.htm#21">Ex 13:21</a>).
<dt>these words...- ie. <a href="joh8.htm#12" target="lwr_lt">v.12-19</a>. Jesus was identifying Himself as the Light of the pillar of fire.<dd>The Lord Himself stood in their midst, though they were clouded in darkness.
<dt>no man laid hands on Him...- His words offended them. 
<dd>But they were powerless to take action against Him. cp. <a href="joh7.htm#30">7:30,44</a></dl><dt>
<b><i>8:21  Then said Jesus again unto them,<br>
I go my way, and ye shall seek me, and shall die in your sins:<br>
whither I go, ye cannot come.</i></b>
<dd>said... again unto them...- ie., as He had spoken on the previous day, <a href="joh7.htm#32">7:32-34</a>
<dd>die in your sins...- of which, they had been convicted, in His presence (<a href="joh8.htm#7" target="lwr_lt">v.7-9</a>).<dt>
<b><i>8:22  Then said the Jews, Will he kill himself?<br>
because he saith, Whither I go, ye cannot come.</i></b> {cp. <a href="joh7.htm#34">7:34-36</a>}</dt><dl>
<dt>Will he kill himself? - Death was their desire for Him (<a href="joh8.htm#37" target="lwr_lt">v.37,40</a>).
<dd>&quot;No! He will give Himself a ransom for many.&quot; [McGee] cp. <a href="joh10.htm#11">10:11,18</a></dl><dt>
<b><i>8:23  And he said unto them, Ye are from beneath; I am from above:<br>
ye are of this world; I am not of this world.<br>
8:24  I said therefore unto you, that ye shall die in your sins:<br>
for if ye believe not that I am [he], ye shall die in your sins.</i></b></dt><dl>
<dt>from beneath... from above- He contrasts their earthly nature to His heavenly nature. cp. <a href="joh3.htm#13">3:13</a>
<dd>They had desperate need of the new birth (<a href="joh3.htm#3">3:3,6,7</a>) which requires faith in Him (<a href="joh3.htm#14">3:14,15</a>).
<dt>ye shall die in your sins- Death is the natural consequence of sin. 
<dd>The Lord Jesus Christ provided the only means of escape for us, on His cross.  <a href="rom6.htm#23">Rom 6:23</a>
<dd>Note: The GK word for 'sin', in <a href="joh8.htm#21" target="lwr_lt">v.21</a> is singular, in <a href="joh8.htm#24" target="lwr_lt">v.24</a> is plural. 
<dd>-- The singular may speak of their sin of unbelief in Him, or of their overall sinful condition.<br>
-- The plural speaks of their many iniquities. (cp. singular <a href="joh16.htm#9">16:9</a>; <a href="2cor5.htm#21">2Cor 5:21</a>; plural <a href="1pet2.htm#24">1Pet 2:24</a>)

<b><i>8:25  Then said they unto him, Who art thou? </i></b>

<dd>Or, was this the faith of those who having been examined by the Light, see their sinful condition and turn to the Savior?</dl><dt>

<b><i>8:33  They answered him,<br>
We be Abraham's seed, and were never in bondage to any man:<br>
how sayest thou, Ye shall be made free?</i></b>
<dd>Their perspective on Jesus' words is physical &amp; fleshly. Jesus answers both points raised:<ul>
<li>we are Abraham's seed. (Answered in <a href="joh8.htm#37" target="lwr_lt">v.37</a>.)
<li>we were never in bondage.- ie., we are &amp; always have been free men. (Answered in <a href="joh8.htm#34" target="lwr_lt">v.34</a>.)<br>Strangely, they ignored Israel's historic subservience to Egypt (<a href="ex1.htm#13">Ex 1:13,14</a>), Assyria, Babylon, Persia (cp. <a href="ezr9.htm#5">Ezr 9:5-9</a>; <a href="neh9.htm#36">Neh 9:36,37</a>), Greece, and (at that time) Rome.

<dt>the servant of sin- cp. <a href="rom6.htm#16">Rom 6:16</a>; <a href="rom7.htm#14">7:14,24 </a>

<dd>Just as Satan refused the light of God's truth, preferring to dwell in the darkness of his own lie, these men were by nature children of falsehood. They could not receive the truth, but they would receive a lie.

<dd>Jesus did not say that His disciples would not taste {ie., partake of} physical death (cp. <a href="mat16.htm#28">Mat 16:28</a>).
