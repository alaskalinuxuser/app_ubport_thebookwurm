Proverbs  30<br> 1. The words of Agur the son of Jakeh, [even] the prophecy: the man spake unto Ithiel, even unto Ithiel and Ucal,<br><a name="2">2</a>  Surely I [am] more brutish than [any] man, and have not the understanding of a man.<br><a name="3">3</a>  I neither learned wisdom, nor have the knowledge of the holy.<br><a name="4">4</a>  Who hath ascended up into heaven, or descended? who hath gathered the wind in his fists? who hath bound the waters in a garment? who hath established all the ends of the earth? what [is] his name, and what [is] his son's name, if thou canst tell?<br><a name="5">5</a>  Every word of God [is] pure: he [is] a shield unto them that put their trust in him.<br><a name="6">6</a>  Add thou not unto his words, lest he reprove thee, and thou be found a liar.<br><a name="7">7</a>. Two [things] have I required of thee; deny me [them] not before I die:<br><a name="8">8</a>  Remove far from me vanity and lies: give me neither poverty nor riches; feed me with food convenient for me:<br><a name="9">9</a>  Lest I be full, and deny [thee], and say, Who [is] the LORD? or lest I be poor, and steal, and take the name of my God [in vain].<br><a name="10">10</a>. Accuse not a servant unto his master, lest he curse thee, and thou be found guilty.<br><a name="11">11</a>  [There is] a generation [that] curseth their father, and doth not bless their mother.<br><a name="12">12</a>  [There is] a generation [that are] pure in their own eyes, and [yet] is not washed from their filthiness.<br><a name="13">13</a>  [There is] a generation, O how lofty are their eyes! and their eyelids are lifted up.<br><a name="14">14</a>  [There is] a generation, whose teeth [are as] swords, and their jaw teeth [as] knives, to devour the poor from off the earth, and the needy from [among] men.<br><a name="15">15</a>. The horseleach hath two daughters, [crying], Give, give. There are three [things that] are never satisfied, [yea], four [things] say not, [It is] enough:<br><a name="16">16</a>  The grave; and the barren womb; the earth [that] is not filled with water; and the fire [that] saith not, [It is] enough.<br><a name="17">17</a>  The eye [that] mocketh at [his] father, and despiseth to obey [his] mother, the ravens of the valley shall pick it out, and the young eagles shall eat it.<br><a name="18">18</a>. There be three [things which] are too wonderful for me, yea, four which I know not:<br><a name="19">19</a>  The way of an eagle in the air; the way of a serpent upon a rock; the way of a ship in the midst of the sea; and the way of a man with a maid.<br><a name="20">20</a>  Such [is] the way of an adulterous woman; she eateth, and wipeth her mouth, and saith, I have done no wickedness.<br><a name="21">21</a>  For three [things] the earth is disquieted, and for four [which] it cannot bear:<br><a name="22">22</a>  For a servant when he reigneth; and a fool when he is filled with meat;<br><a name="23">23</a>  For an odious [woman] when she is married; and an handmaid that is heir to her mistress.<br><a name="24">24</a>. There be four [things which are] little upon the earth, but they [are] exceeding wise:<br><a name="25">25</a>  The ants [are] a people not strong, yet they prepare their meat in the summer;<br><a name="26">26</a>  The conies [are but] a feeble folk, yet make they their houses in the rocks;<br><a name="27">27</a>  The locusts have no king, yet go they forth all of them by bands;<br><a name="28">28</a>  The spider taketh hold with her hands, and is in kings' palaces.<br><a name="29">29</a>. There be three [things] which go well, yea, four are comely in going:<br><a name="30">30</a>  A lion [which is] strongest among beasts, and turneth not away for any;<br><a name="31">31</a>  A greyhound; an he goat also; and a king, against whom [there is] no rising up.<br><a name="32">32</a>  If thou hast done foolishly in lifting up thyself, or if thou hast thought evil, [lay] thine hand upon thy mouth.<br><a name="33">33</a>  Surely the churning of milk bringeth forth butter, and the wringing of the nose bringeth forth blood: so the forcing of wrath bringeth forth strife.<br><br>Go to <a href="pro31.htm#1">Proverbs 31</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
