Luke  24<br> 1. Now upon the first [day] of the week, very early in the morning, they came unto the sepulchre, bringing the spices which they had prepared, and certain [others] with them.<br><a name="2">2</a>  And they found the stone rolled away from the sepulchre.<br><a name="3">3</a>  And they entered in, and found not the body of the Lord Jesus.<br><a name="4">4</a>  And it came to pass, as they were much perplexed thereabout, behold, two men stood by them in shining garments:<br><a name="5">5</a>  And as they were afraid, and bowed down [their] faces to the earth, they said unto them, Why seek ye the living among the dead?<br><a name="6">6</a>  He is not here, but is risen: remember how he spake unto you when he was yet in Galilee,<br><a name="7">7</a>  Saying, The Son of man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men, and be crucified, and the third day rise again.<br><a name="8">8</a>  And they remembered his words,<br><a name="9">9</a>  And returned from the sepulchre, and told all these things unto the eleven, and to all the rest.<br><a name="10">10</a>  It was Mary Magdalene, and Joanna, and Mary [the mother] of James, and other [women that were] with them, which told these things unto the apostles.<br><a name="11">11</a>  And their words seemed to them as idle tales, and they believed them not.<br><a name="12">12</a>  Then arose Peter, and ran unto the sepulchre; and stooping down, he beheld the linen clothes laid by themselves, and departed, wondering in himself at that which was come to pass.<br><a name="13">13</a>. And, behold, two of them went that same day to a village called Emmaus, which was from Jerusalem [about] threescore furlongs.<br><a name="14">14</a>  And they talked together of all these things which had happened.<br><a name="15">15</a>  And it came to pass, that, while they communed [together] and reasoned, Jesus himself drew near, and went with them.<br><a name="16">16</a>  But their eyes were holden that they should not know him.<br><a name="17">17</a>  And he said unto them, What manner of communications [are] these that ye have one to another, as ye walk, and are sad?<br><a name="18">18</a>  And the one of them, whose name was Cleopas, answering said unto him, Art thou only a stranger in Jerusalem, and hast not known the things which are come to pass there in these days?<br><a name="19">19</a>  And he said unto them, What things? And they said unto him, Concerning Jesus of Nazareth, which was a prophet mighty in deed and word before God and all the people:<br><a name="20">20</a>  And how the chief priests and our rulers delivered him to be condemned to death, and have crucified him.<br><a name="21">21</a>  But we trusted that it had been he which should have redeemed Israel: and beside all this, to day is the third day since these things were done.<br><a name="22">22</a>  Yea, and certain women also of our company made us astonished, which were early at the sepulchre;<br><a name="23">23</a>  And when they found not his body, they came, saying, that they had also seen a vision of angels, which said that he was alive.<br><a name="24">24</a>  And certain of them which were with us went to the sepulchre, and found [it] even so as the women had said: but him they saw not.<br><a name="25">25</a>  Then he said unto them, O fools, and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken:<br><a name="26">26</a>  Ought not Christ to have suffered these things, and to enter into his glory?<br><a name="27">27</a>  And beginning at Moses and all the prophets, he expounded unto them in all the scriptures the things concerning himself.<br><a name="28">28</a>  And they drew nigh unto the village, whither they went: and he made as though he would have gone further.<br><a name="29">29</a>  But they constrained him, saying, Abide with us: for it is toward evening, and the day is far spent. And he went in to tarry with them.<br><a name="30">30</a>  And it came to pass, as he sat at meat with them, he took bread, and blessed [it], and brake, and gave to them.<br><a name="31">31</a>  And their eyes were opened, and they knew him; and he vanished out of their sight.<br><a name="32">32</a>  And they said one to another, Did not our heart burn within us, while he talked with us by the way, and while he opened to us the scriptures?<br><a name="33">33</a>  And they rose up the same hour, and returned to Jerusalem, and found the eleven gathered together, and them that were with them,<br><a name="34">34</a>  Saying, The Lord is risen indeed, and hath appeared to Simon.<br><a name="35">35</a>  And they told what things [were done] in the way, and how he was known of them in breaking of bread.<br><a name="36">36</a>. And as they thus spake, Jesus himself stood in the midst of them, and saith unto them, Peace [be] unto you.<br><a name="37">37</a>  But they were terrified and affrighted, and supposed that they had seen a spirit.<br><a name="38">38</a>  And he said unto them, Why are ye troubled? and why do thoughts arise in your hearts?<br><a name="39">39</a>  Behold my hands and my feet, that it is I myself: handle me, and see; for a spirit hath not flesh and bones, as ye see me have.<br><a name="40">40</a>  And when he had thus spoken, he shewed them [his] hands and [his] feet.<br><a name="41">41</a>  And while they yet believed not for joy, and wondered, he said unto them, Have ye here any meat?<br><a name="42">42</a>  And they gave him a piece of a broiled fish, and of an honeycomb.<br><a name="43">43</a>  And he took [it], and did eat before them.<br><a name="44">44</a>  And he said unto them, These [are] the words which I spake unto you, while I was yet with you, that all things must be fulfilled, which were written in the law of Moses, and [in] the prophets, and [in] the psalms, concerning me.<br><a name="45">45</a>  Then opened he their understanding, that they might understand the scriptures,<br><a name="46">46</a>  And said unto them, Thus it is written, and thus it behoved Christ to suffer, and to rise from the dead the third day:<br><a name="47">47</a>  And that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name among all nations, beginning at Jerusalem.<br><a name="48">48</a>  And ye are witnesses of these things.<br><a name="49">49</a>  And, behold, I send the promise of my Father upon you: but tarry ye in the city of Jerusalem, until ye be endued with power from on high.<br><a name="50">50</a>. And he led them out as far as to Bethany, and he lifted up his hands, and blessed them.<br><a name="51">51</a>  And it came to pass, while he blessed them, he was parted from them, and carried up into heaven.<br><a name="52">52</a>  And they worshipped him, and returned to Jerusalem with great joy:<br><a name="53">53</a>  And were continually in the temple, praising and blessing God.
