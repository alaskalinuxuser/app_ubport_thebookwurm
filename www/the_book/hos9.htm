Hosea   9<br>1. Rejoice not, O Israel, for joy, as [other] people: for thou hast gone a whoring from thy God, thou hast loved a reward upon every cornfloor.<br><a name="2">2</a>  The floor and the winepress shall not feed them, and the new wine shall fail in her.<br><a name="3">3</a>  They shall not dwell in the LORD'S land; but Ephraim shall return to Egypt, and they shall eat unclean [things] in Assyria.<br><a name="4">4</a>  They shall not offer wine [offerings] to the LORD, neither shall they be pleasing unto him: their sacrifices [shall be] unto them as the bread of mourners; all that eat thereof shall be polluted: for their bread for their soul shall not come into the house of the LORD.<br><a name="5">5</a>  What will ye do in the solemn day, and in the day of the feast of the LORD?<br><a name="6">6</a>  For, lo, they are gone because of destruction: Egypt shall gather them up, Memphis shall bury them: the pleasant [places] for their silver, nettles shall possess them: thorns [shall be] in their tabernacles.<br><a name="7">7</a>. The days of visitation are come, the days of recompence are come; Israel shall know [it]: the prophet [is] a fool, the spiritual man [is] mad, for the multitude of thine iniquity, and the great hatred.<br><a name="8">8</a>  The watchman of Ephraim [was] with my God: [but] the prophet [is] a snare of a fowler in all his ways, [and] hatred in the house of his God.<br><a name="9">9</a>  They have deeply corrupted [themselves], as in the days of Gibeah: [therefore] he will remember their iniquity, he will visit their sins.<br><a name="10">10</a>  I found Israel like grapes in the wilderness; I saw your fathers as the firstripe in the fig tree at her first time: [but] they went to Baalpeor, and separated themselves unto [that] shame; and [their] abominations were according as they loved.<br><a name="11">11</a>. [As for] Ephraim, their glory shall fly away like a bird, from the birth, and from the womb, and from the conception.<br><a name="12">12</a>  Though they bring up their children, yet will I bereave them, [that there shall] not [be] a man [left]: yea, woe also to them when I depart from them!<br><a name="13">13</a>  Ephraim, as I saw Tyrus, [is] planted in a pleasant place: but Ephraim shall bring forth his children to the murderer.<br><a name="14">14</a>  Give them, O LORD: what wilt thou give? give them a miscarrying womb and dry breasts.<br><a name="15">15</a>  All their wickedness [is] in Gilgal: for there I hated them: for the wickedness of their doings I will drive them out of mine house, I will love them no more: all their princes [are] revolters.<br><a name="16">16</a>  Ephraim is smitten, their root is dried up, they shall bear no fruit: yea, though they bring forth, yet will I slay [even] the beloved [fruit] of their womb.<br><a name="17">17</a>  My God will cast them away, because they did not hearken unto him: and they shall be wanderers among the nations.<br><br>Go to <a href="hos10.htm#1">Hosea 10</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
