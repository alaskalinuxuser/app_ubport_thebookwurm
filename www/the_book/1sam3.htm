1Samuel   3<br>1. And the child Samuel ministered unto the LORD before Eli. And the word of the LORD was precious in those days; [there was] no open vision.<br><a name="2">2</a>  And it came to pass at that time, when Eli [was] laid down in his place, and his eyes began to wax dim, [that] he could not see;<br><a name="3">3</a>  And ere the lamp of God went out in the temple of the LORD, where the ark of God [was], and Samuel was laid down [to sleep];<br><a name="4">4</a>  That the LORD called Samuel: and he answered, Here [am] I.<br><a name="5">5</a>  And he ran unto Eli, and said, Here [am] I; for thou calledst me. And he said, I called not; lie down again. And he went and lay down.<br><a name="6">6</a>  And the LORD called yet again, Samuel. And Samuel arose and went to Eli, and said, Here [am] I; for thou didst call me. And he answered, I called not, my son; lie down again.<br><a name="7">7</a>  Now Samuel did not yet know the LORD, neither was the word of the LORD yet revealed unto him.<br><a name="8">8</a>  And the LORD called Samuel again the third time. And he arose and went to Eli, and said, Here [am] I; for thou didst call me. And Eli perceived that the LORD had called the child.<br><a name="9">9</a>  Therefore Eli said unto Samuel, Go, lie down: and it shall be, if he call thee, that thou shalt say, Speak, LORD; for thy servant heareth. So Samuel went and lay down in his place.<br><a name="10">10</a>  And the LORD came, and stood, and called as at other times, Samuel, Samuel. Then Samuel answered, Speak; for thy servant heareth.<br><a name="11">11</a>. And the LORD said to Samuel, Behold, I will do a thing in Israel, at which both the ears of every one that heareth it shall tingle.<br><a name="12">12</a>  In that day I will perform against Eli all [things] which I have spoken concerning his house: when I begin, I will also make an end.<br><a name="13">13</a>  For I have told him that I will judge his house for ever for the iniquity which he knoweth; because his sons made themselves vile, and he restrained them not.<br><a name="14">14</a>  And therefore I have sworn unto the house of Eli, that the iniquity of Eli's house shall not be purged with sacrifice nor offering for ever.<br><a name="15">15</a>  And Samuel lay until the morning, and opened the doors of the house of the LORD. And Samuel feared to shew Eli the vision.<br><a name="16">16</a>  Then Eli called Samuel, and said, Samuel, my son. And he answered, Here [am] I.<br><a name="17">17</a>  And he said, What [is] the thing that [the LORD] hath said unto thee? I pray thee hide [it] not from me: God do so to thee, and more also, if thou hide [any] thing from me of all the things that he said unto thee.<br><a name="18">18</a>  And Samuel told him every whit, and hid nothing from him. And he said, It [is] the LORD: let him do what seemeth him good.<br><a name="19">19</a>. And Samuel grew, and the LORD was with him, and did let none of his words fall to the ground.<br><a name="20">20</a>  And all Israel from Dan even to Beersheba knew that Samuel [was] established [to be] a prophet of the LORD.<br><a name="21">21</a>  And the LORD appeared again in Shiloh: for the LORD revealed himself to Samuel in Shiloh by the word of the LORD.<br><br>Go to <a href="1sam4.htm#1">I Samuel 4</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
