Psalms 144<br>1. [A Psalm] of David. Blessed [be] the LORD my strength, which teacheth my hands to war, [and] my fingers to fight:<br><a name="2">2</a>  My goodness, and my fortress; my high tower, and my deliverer; my shield, and [he] in whom I trust; who subdueth my people under me.<br><a name="3">3</a>  LORD, what [is] man, that thou takest knowledge of him! [or] the son of man, that thou makest account of him!<br><a name="4">4</a>  Man is like to vanity: his days [are] as a shadow that passeth away.<br><a name="5">5</a>  Bow thy heavens, O LORD, and come down: touch the mountains, and they shall smoke.<br><a name="6">6</a>  Cast forth lightning, and scatter them: shoot out thine arrows, and destroy them.<br><a name="7">7</a>  Send thine hand from above; rid me, and deliver me out of great waters, from the hand of strange children;<br><a name="8">8</a>  Whose mouth speaketh vanity, and their right hand [is] a right hand of falsehood.<br><a name="9">9</a>. I will sing a new song unto thee, O God: upon a psaltery [and] an instrument of ten strings will I sing praises unto thee.<br><a name="10">10</a>  [It is he] that giveth salvation unto kings: who delivereth David his servant from the hurtful sword.<br><a name="11">11</a>  Rid me, and deliver me from the hand of strange children, whose mouth speaketh vanity, and their right hand [is] a right hand of falsehood:<br><a name="12">12</a>  That our sons [may be] as plants grown up in their youth; [that] our daughters [may be] as corner stones, polished [after] the similitude of a palace:<br><a name="13">13</a>  [That] our garners [may be] full, affording all manner of store: [that] our sheep may bring forth thousands and ten thousands in our streets:<br><a name="14">14</a>  [That] our oxen [may be] strong to labour; [that there be] no breaking in, nor going out; that [there be] no complaining in our streets.<br><a name="15">15</a>  Happy [is that] people, that is in such a case: [yea], happy [is that] people, whose God [is] the LORD.<br><br>Go to <a href="psa145.htm#1">Psalm 145</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
