<dl><dt><b>A Man of Sorrows wrestles under God's Wrath,</b> ch. 3
<dd>This chapter is the high point of the book. It is here that the prophet begins to come to terms with the terrible destruction that has come upon his people, and finds reason for hope.
<p>Although the chapter is set in the first person and begins &quot;I am the man...,&quot; many scholars think these are the words of Jerusalem personified (as in <a href="lam1.htm#12">1:12-22</a>; <a href="lam2.htm#22">2:22</a>).<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, much of the chapter can apply only to a man, not to a city (eg., <a href="lam3.htm#14" target="lwr_lt">3:14</a>, <a href="lam3.htm#52" target="lwr_lt">52-54</a>). Jeremiah experienced things similar to those mentioned by &quot;the man&quot; here (cp. <a href="jer1.htm#18">Jer 1:18,19</a> with <a href="lam3.htm#52" target="lwr_lt">Lam 3:52</a>... <a href="jer20.htm#7">Jer 20:7,8</a> with <a href="lam3.htm#63" target="lwr_lt">Lam 3:63</a>... <a href="jer11.htm#18">Jer 11:18,19</a> with <a href="lam3.htm#60" target="lwr_lt">Lam 3:60</a>... <a href="jer38.htm#4">Jer 38:4-13</a> with <a href="lam3.htm#53" target="lwr_lt">Lam 3:53-58</a>... <a href="jer9.htm#1">Jer 9:1</a>; <a href="jer13.htm#17">13:17</a>; <a href="jer14.htm#17">14:17</a> with <a href="lam3.htm#48" target="lwr_lt">Lam 3:48,49</a>). Therefore, it is evident that Jeremiah is speaking here.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, portions of the chapter are in the first person plural (&quot;we... us... our,&quot; <a href="lam3.htm#22" target="lwr_lt">v.22</a>, <a href="lam3.htm#42" target="lwr_lt">42-47</a>). At least in these sections, Jeremiah is echoed by other individuals whose hearts are in harmony with his. These are the mingled voices of the believing remnant praying for the promised restoration of Israel.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is yet a third voice audible here. It is that of the LORD our Righteousness (as we observed briefly, in chapter 1). The chapter contains numerous parallels and allusions to other OT passages which, according to the NT, are Messianic foreviews of our Lord Jesus Christ. 
<p>Perhaps because of its unique perspective, this chapter is also set apart from the others by its literary style. There are 66 verses in ch. 3, compared to the 22 verses in the other four chapters. Whereas each verse in ch. 1, 2 and 4 begins with the next letter of the Hebrew alphabet, chapter 3 is arranged in triplets. Each verse of each group of three verses begins with the next Hebrew letter. &quot;This triple formation harmonizes with the triple relationship of the Elegy {Lament} of the Spirit of Christ in the Prophet personally, in the Remnant prophetically, and in Christ Himself absolutely.&quot; [in quotes, GWms]
<p>Note also that this chapter does not begin with &quot;How... {Alas...},&quot; as do the two chapters before and the chapter following. In those chapters, the observing prophet is stunned by what has happened to his city and people. He sorrowfully reports the consequences of their sin. In chapter three, the one who speaks bears the weight of that sin personally, as a representative of the people, before the LORD (cp. <a href="isa53.htm#4">Isa 53:4-7</a>).
<dt><b>I. A man of Sorrows,</b> <a href="lam3.htm#1" target="lwr_lt">v.1-18</a> (cp. <a href="isa53.htm#3">Isa 53:3</a>)<ul>
<li>affliction... (v.1) - consistent with Jeremiah's prior experience <a href="jer15.htm#17">Jer 15:17,18</a>; <a href="jer20.htm#14">20:14-18</a><br>
... by the rod of His wrath. - Chapter 2 revealed that the LORD actively exercised His wrath<dd>
upon His people for their sin. What seemed to be the work of an enemy nation, was shown to be what &quot;He hath...&quot; done. Chapter 3 continues the repeated refrain &quot;He hath...&quot; But here, the LORD's wrath is poured out upon Jeremiah, the servant of the LORD, who was innocent of the nation's crimes. Thus, Jeremiah is a type (picture) of Christ.<br>[This passage is rich with parallels to the sufferings of Job, with recollections of prophetic warnings of judgment,  and of Jeremiah's rejection by his people and identification in their sorrows. The references in<b> bold font </b>speak of the sufferings of Christ.]

<dt><b>II. A man whose Hope is in the LORD,</b> <a href="lam3.htm#19" target="lwr_lt">v.19-40</a><ul>
<li>Reason for despair - in the flesh: Jeremiah, recalling his troubles, found his soul humbled {lit., downcast} (v.20).
<li>Reason for hope - in the LORD.<br>
Jeremiah chose to turn back, from the memories that naturally flooded his mind, to the LORD. The word &quot;recall&quot; in v.21 means &quot;to turn back.&quot; Hope began to dawn as he refused to be held captive by the memories {a different word in v.19,20} that held him in despair.<ol type="A">
<li>It is of the LORD's mercies {HB= hesed, loyal love, steadfast love} that we are not consumed... (v.22)-<br>The LORD could have annihilated the nation. But He has left a remnant. Therefore, His promise of future restoration remains sure. <a href="mal3.htm#6">Mal 3:6</a>; <a href="mic7.htm#18">Mic 7:18,19</a>; <a href="ezr9.htm#8">Ezr 9:8,9</a>
<li>His compassions  {ie., tender affections. The HB root is related to the word for &quot;womb.&quot;} fail not. They are new every morning. (v.23)- Though Israel has failed and will fail again to follow Him. He will not cast them off completely. cp. <a href="zeph3.htm#5">Zeph 3:5</a>; <a href="psa89.htm#1">Psa 89:1,2,33</a>
<li>Great is Thy faithfulness {fidelity; steadfastness}- Though Israel has been unfaithful, He is faithful still.
<li>The LORD is my portion... (v.24)- Though everything else has been lost, in Him I have everything. <b><a href="psa16.htm#5">Psa 16:5</a></b>; <a href="psa73.htm#26">73:26</a>; <a href="psa142.htm#4">142:4,5</a>; <a href="jer10.htm#16">Jer 10:16</a>
<li>The LORD is good unto them that wait for {ie., expectantly look to} Him... (v.25)-<br>
... to the soul that seeketh {ie., resorts to} Him... - (ie., to the afflicted, despairing soul, whose portion and hope is the Lord, v.20,24), cp. <a href="psa130.htm#5">Psa 130:5-8</a>; <a href="isa30.htm#15">Isa 30:15</a> [Points 1-7, below, were adapted from TBKC.]<ol type="1">
<li>Affliction can be endured through hope in God's salvation (v.25-30)
<li>Affliction is temporary and tempered by God's compassion and love (v.31,32)
<li>Affliction is not God's desire for people (v.33)
<li>Affliction through injustice is not approved of God (v.34-36)
<li>Affliction is subject to God's sovereignty (v.37,38), cp. <a href="job2.htm#10">Job 2:10</a>
<li>Affliction ought to be expected by the sinner (v.39), cp. <a href="deu28.htm#15">Deu 28:15f</a>; <a href="lam1.htm#8">Lam 1:8</a>
(In fact, as punishment for sin, affliction is a mercy, since the punishment due has been temporarily withheld. Eze 18:4</a>)
<li>Affliction ought to turn sinners back to the Lord (v.40). <a href="deu30.htm#1">Deu 30:1-10</a></ol></ol>
<li>Preview of Salvation - Jeremiah, in his affliction for sin and in his hope in the LORD, is a picture of the Man of Sorrows, who is the Hope of the afflicted sinner. <a href="isa53.htm#3">Isa 53:3,10,11</a>; <a href="eph2.htm#12">Eph 2:12,13</a>; <a href="col1.htm#27">Col 1:27</a>; <a href="1tim1.htm#1">1Tim 1:1</a><br>Our Savior suffered as a man (<a href="php2.htm#6">Php 2:6-8</a>). Several elements of His human experience are foreshadowed in this passage.<dd>
The LORD is good to them that wait for Him... to <i>the soul</i> that seeketh Him... (v.25), <a href="psa34.htm#4">Psa 34:4</a>; <a href="psa40.htm#1">40:1-3</a>; <a href="psa116.htm#3">116:3-5</a><br>
It is good that <i>a man</i> should...<br>
... hope {lit., writhe, tremble, travail, be in anguish, be pained (often of travail in childbirth)} (v.26), cp. <a href="joh12.htm#27">John 12:27</a><br>
... quietly wait {ie., be silent} for the salvation of the LORD. cp. <a href="isa53.htm#7">Isa 53:7</a><br>
... bear the yoke in his youth (v.27), cp. <a href="mat11.htm#27">Mat 11:27-30</a> (of absolute obedience to the Father)<br>
... sit alone (v.28), cp. <a href="joh16.htm#32">Joh 16:32</a><br>
... and keep silence {or, 'be silenced,' as by death}<br>
... in the dust (v.29), cp. <a href="psa22.htm#15">Psa 22:15</a><br>
... He giveth his cheek to him that smiteth him (v.30)...<br>
... He is filled with reproach (<a href="isa50.htm#6">Isa 50:6</a>; <a href="psa69.htm#20">Psa 69:20</a>; <a href="mat26.htm#67">Mat 26:67,68</a>; <a href="mat27.htm#30">27:30,31</a>)<br>
The result of this man's afflictions:<br>
...For the LORD will not cast off for ever... though He cause grief, yet He will have compassion (v.31-33), cp. <a href="psa22.htm#23">Psa 22:23,24</a></ol></ol></ul>
<dt><b>III. A man of Prayer,</b> <a href="lam3.htm#41" target="lwr_lt">v.41-66</a> - Here again, Jeremiah pictures Christ (in points C-E, the cited Psalms speak of the Messiah.)<ol type="A">
<li>Repentance of sin, acknowledgment of God's righteous judgment, v.41-47. - This section is written in the plural (we, us...) and represents the prayer of the believing remnant prior to the promised restoration. <a href="deu30.htm#1">Deu 30:1-3</a>; <a href="jer29.htm#13">Jer 29:13</a>
<li>Intercession for his people, v.48-51 - The remainder of the chapter is again in the singular. Jeremiah intercedes earnestly in behalf of his countrymen, whose sin had separated them from God. While the prophet's prayer was effective (v.49,50), the prayers of the people were not getting through the cloud of their sin (cp. v.44; <a href="isa59.htm#1">Isa 59:1,2</a>). Other godly men have interceded for their people (eg.,  Daniel, <a href="dan9.htm#16">Dan 9:16-19</a>; Paul, <a href="rom9.htm#1">Rom 9:1-3</a>). Similarly, the Savior makes intercession: <a href="luk19.htm#41">Luk 19:41-43</a>; <a href="heb7.htm#25">Heb 7:25-27</a>
<li>Petition for personal deliverance, v.52-55 - Jeremiah's experience of persecution, including the threat to his life when he was thrown into the dungeon (<a href="jer38.htm#1">Jer 38:1-6</a>), foreshadow the sufferings of Christ... without a cause... life cut off... cast a stone upon me... waters over my soul... <a href="psa69.htm#1">Psa 69:1-4,15</a>; <a href="psa116.htm#1">116:1-4</a>
<li>Praise for personal redemption [redeemed by the 'kinsman redeemer,' HB= 'goel,' cp. <a href="isa59.htm#20">Isa 59:20</a>], v.56-59; cp. <a href="psa116.htm#5">Psa 116:5-9</a>
<li>Request for destruction of enemies, v.61-66; cp. <a href="psa69.htm#21">Psa 69:21-29</a></ol>
