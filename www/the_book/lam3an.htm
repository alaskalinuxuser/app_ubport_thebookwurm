<dl><dt><b>A Man of Sorrows wrestles under God's Wrath,</b> ch. 3
<dd>This chapter is the high point of the book. It is here that the prophet begins to come to terms with the terrible destruction that has come upon his people, and finds reason for hope.
<p>Although the chapter is set in the first person and begins &quot;I am the man...,&quot; many scholars think these are the words of Jerusalem personified (as in <a href="lam1.htm#12">1:12-22</a>; <a href="lam2.htm#22">2:22</a>).<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;However, much of the chapter can apply only to a man, not to a city (eg., <a href="lam3.htm#14" target="lwr_lt">3:14</a>,<a href="lam3.htm#52" target="lwr_lt">52-54</a>). Jeremiah experienced things similar to those mentioned by &quot;the man&quot; here (cp. <a href="jer1.htm#18">Jer 1:18,19</a> with <a href="lam3.htm#52" target="lwr_lt">Lam 3:52</a> -- <a href="jer20.htm#7">Jer 20:7,8</a> with <a href="lam3.htm#63" target="lwr_lt">Lam 3:63</a> -- <a href="jer11.htm#18">Jer 11:18,19</a> with <a href="lam3.htm#60" target="lwr_lt">Lam 3:60</a> -- <a href="jer38.htm#4">Jer 38:4-13</a> with <a href="lam3.htm#53" target="lwr_lt">Lam 3:53-58</a> -- <a href="jer9.htm#1">Jer 9:1</a>; <a href="jer13.htm#17">13:17</a>; <a href="jer14.htm#17">14:17</a> with <a href="lam3.htm#48" target="lwr_lt">Lam 3:48,49</a>). Therefore, it is evident that Jeremiah is speaking here.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;However, portions of the chapter are in the first person plural (&quot;we... us... our,&quot; <a href="lam3.htm#22" target="lwr_lt">v.22</a>, <a href="lam3.htm#42" target="lwr_lt">42-47</a>). In some of these sections, Jeremiah is echoed by other individuals whose hearts are in harmony with his. These are the mingled voices of the believing remnant, praying for the promised restoration of Israel.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;There is yet a third voice audible here. It is that of the LORD our Righteousness (whom we observed, in our study, near the end of chapter 1). The chapter, before us, contains numerous parallels and allusions to other OT passages which, according to the NT, are Messianic foreviews of our Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>Perhaps because of its unique perspective, this chapter is also set apart from the others by its literary style. There are 66 verses in ch. 3, compared to the 22 verses in the other four chapters. Whereas each verse in ch. 1, 2 and 4 begins with the next letter of the Hebrew alphabet, chapter 3 is arranged in triplets. Each verse of each group of three verses begins with the next Hebrew letter. &quot;This triple formation harmonizes with the triple relationship of the Elegy {Lament} of the Spirit of Christ in the Prophet personally, in the Remnant prophetically, and in Christ Himself absolutely.&quot; [in quotes, GWms]</p>
<p>Note also that this chapter does not begin with &quot;How... {Alas...},&quot; as do the two chapters before and the chapter following. In those chapters, the observing prophet is stunned by what has happened to his city and people. He sorrowfully reports the consequences of their sin. In chapter three, the one who speaks bears the weight of that sin personally, as a representative of the people, before the LORD (cp. <a href="isa53.htm#4">Isa 53:4-7</a>).</p>
<dt><b>I. A man of Sorrows,</b> <a href="lam3.htm#1" target="lwr_lt">v.1-18</a> (cp. <a href="isa53.htm#3">Isa 53:3</a>)<ul>

...by the rod of His wrath. - Chapter 2 revealed that the LORD actively exercised His wrath,<dd>
upon His people for their sin. What seemed to be the work of an enemy nation, was shown to be what &quot;He hath...&quot; done.</dd><dd>Chapter 3 continues the repeated refrain &quot;He hath...&quot;</dd><dd>But here, the LORD's wrath is poured out upon Jeremiah, the servant of the LORD, who was innocent of the nation's crimes.</dd><dd>Thus, Jeremiah is a type (a picture) of Christ.</dd><dd>[This passage is rich... with parallels to the sufferings of Job... with reminders of forgotten prophetic warnings...  and with recollection of Jeremiah's tears (as one rejected by his people, yet, grieving for their sorrows).

<dt><b>II. A man whose Hope is in the LORD,</b> <a href="lam3.htm#19" target="lwr_lt">v.19-40</a><ul>
<li>Reason for despair - in the flesh: Jeremiah, recalling his troubles, found his soul humbled {lit., downcast} (v.20).
<li>Reason for hope - in the LORD (v.21).<br>
Jeremiah chose to turn back, from the painful bitter memories that naturally flooded his mind, to the LORD. (The word &quot;recall&quot; in v.21 means &quot;to turn back.&quot;) From his dark dungeon of despair, he turned to gaze upon the LORD, and hope began to dawn.<ol type="A">
<li>It is of the LORD's mercies {HB= hesed, loyal love, steadfast love} that we are not consumed... (v.22)-<dd>The LORD could have annihilated the nation. But He has left a remnant.</dd><dd>Therefore, His promise of future restoration remains sure. <a href="mal3.htm#6">Mal 3:6</a>; <a href="mic7.htm#18">Mic 7:18,19</a>; <a href="ezr9.htm#8">Ezr 9:8,9</a>; <a href="rom11.htm#5">Rom 11:5</a></dd>
<li>His compassions fail not. They are new every morning. (v.22b,23a)-<dd>His compassions {ie., tender affections.} will usher them toward a new birth.<dd><dd>(The HB root word for 'compassions' is related to the word for &quot;womb.&quot;)</dd><dd>Though Israel has failed and will fail again... He will not cast them off completely. cp. <a href="zeph3.htm#5">Zeph 3:5</a>; <a href="psa89.htm#1">Psa 89:1,2,33</a></dd>
<li>Great is Thy faithfulness {fidelity; steadfastness}. (v.23b)-<dd>Though Israel has been unfaithful, He is faithful still. <a href="psa89.htm#31">Psa 89:31-37</a></dd>
<li>The LORD is my portion... (v.24)-<dd>Though everything else has been lost, in Him I have everything. <b><a href="psa16.htm#5">Psa 16:5</a></b>; <a href="psa73.htm#26">73:26</a>; <a href="psa142.htm#4">142:4,5</a>; <a href="jer10.htm#16">Jer 10:16</a></dd>
<li>The LORD is good unto them that wait for {ie., expectantly look to} Him... (v.25)-<br>
... to the soul that seeketh {ie., resorts to} Him... -<dd>(ie., to the afflicted, despairing soul, who claims the LORD as his portion and hope, v.24), cp. <a href="psa130.htm#5">Psa 130:5-8</a>; <a href="isa30.htm#15">Isa 30:15</a></dd><dt>[Points 1-7, below, were adapted from TBKC.]<ol type="1">
<li>Affliction can be endured through hope in God's salvation (v.25-30)
<li>Affliction is temporary and tempered by God's compassion and love (v.31,32)
<li>Affliction is not God's desire for people (v.33)
<li>Affliction through injustice is not approved of God (v.34-36)
<li>Affliction is subject to God's sovereignty (v.37,38), cp. <a href="job2.htm#10">Job 2:10</a>
<li>Affliction ought to be expected by the sinner (v.39), cp. <a href="deu28.htm#15">Deu 28:15-f</a>; <a href="lam1.htm#8">Lam 1:8</a>

<li>Affliction ought to turn sinners back to the Lord (v.40). <a href="deu30.htm#1">Deu 30:1-10</a></ol></ol>
<li>Preview of Salvation - Jeremiah, in his affliction for sin and in his hope in the LORD,<dd>is a picture of the Man of Sorrows, who is the Hope of the afflicted sinner. <a href="isa53.htm#3">Isa 53:3-9</a>; <a href="eph2.htm#12">Eph 2:12,13</a>; <a href="col1.htm#27">Col 1:27</a>; <a href="1tim1.htm#1">1Tim 1:1</a></dd><dt>Our Savior suffered as a man (<a href="php2.htm#6">Php 2:6-8</a>). Several elements of His human experience are foreshadowed in this passage.<ul>
<li>The LORD is good to them that wait for Him... to <i>the soul</i> that seeketh Him... (<a href="lam3.htm#25" target="lwr_lt">v.25</a>), <a href="psa34.htm#4">Psa 34:4</a>; <a href="psa40.htm#1">40:1-3</a>; <a href="psa116.htm#3">116:3-5</a>; <a href="isa53.htm#10">Isa 53:10,11</a><br>

...For the LORD will not cast off for ever... though He cause grief, yet He will have compassion (v.31-33), cp. <a href="psa22.htm#23">Psa 22:23,24</a></ul></ul>
<dt><b>III. A man of Prayer,</b> <a href="lam3.htm#41" target="lwr_lt">v.41-66</a> -
<dt>&nbsp; &nbsp; Here again, Jeremiah pictures Christ. (The psalms, cited below, are Messianic.)<ol type="A">
<li>Repentance of sin, acknowledgment of God's righteous judgment, v.41-47.- This section, which is written in the plural (we, us...),<dd>represents the prayer of the believing remnant prior to the promised restoration. <a href="deu30.htm#1">Deu 30:1-3</a>; <a href="jer29.htm#13">Jer 29:13</a></dd><dd>Jeremiah owns the sin of his people, in this prayer of confession, as did Daniel (in <a href="dan9.htm#4">Dan 9:4-15</a>).</dd><dd>In a deeper sense, Jesus took our sins upon Himself (<a href="psa40.htm#12">Psa 40:12</a>; <a href="isa53.htm#5">Isa 53:5,6</a>; <a href="2cor5.htm#21">2Cor 5:21</a>)
<li>Intercession for his people, v.48-51 - The remainder of the chapter is again in the singular.<dd>Jeremiah intercedes earnestly in behalf of his countrymen, whose sin had separated them from God.</dd><dd>While the prayers of the sinful people were shut out from God's Holy Presence (cp. v.44; <a href="isa59.htm#1">Isa 59:1,2</a>), Jeremiah prayed for them (v.49,50; eg., <a href="jer14.htm#7">Jer 14:7-9</a>; <a href="jam5.htm#16">Jam 5:16</a>).</dd><dd>Godly men will pray, for they are moved by the heart of God (eg.,  Daniel, <a href="dan9.htm#16">Dan 9:16-19</a>; Paul, <a href="rom9.htm#1">Rom 9:1-3</a>).</dd><dd>The Savior &quot;ever lives to make intercession...&quot; <a href="luk19.htm#41">Luk 19:41-43</a>; <a href="heb7.htm#25">Heb 7:25-27</a></dd>
<li>Petition for personal deliverance, v.52-55 -<dd>Jeremiah's experiences of persecution, including the threat to his life when he was thrown into the dungeon (<a href="jer38.htm#1">Jer 38:1-6</a>), foreshadow the sufferings of Christ... without a cause... life cut off... cast a stone upon me... waters over my soul... <a href="psa69.htm#1">Psa 69:1-4,15</a>; <a href="psa116.htm#1">116:1-4</a></dd>
<li>Praise for personal redemption, v.56-59; cp. <a href="psa116.htm#5">Psa 116:5-9</a><dd>&quot;Thou has redeemed my life...&quot; (v.58) - This speaks of redemption accomplished by the 'kinsman redeemer' {HB= 'goel,' cp. <a href="isa59.htm#20">Isa 59:20</a>}, the LORD who became a man, to redeem His 'brethren' (<a href="heb2.htm#10">Heb 2:10-18</a>). The price of redemption was paid with His own life blood. Thus, this verse also speaks of the Savior's resurrection, apart from which there would be no redemption for those for whom He died (<a href="psa16.htm#10">Psa 16:10,11</a>; <a href="1cor15.htm#1">1Cor 15:1-4,17</a>
<li>Request for destruction of enemies, v.61-66; cp. <a href="psa69.htm#21">Psa 69:21-29</a>
<dd>Those, who refuse the redemption for which the Savior paid, must pay the wages of sin for themselves, for the LORD will purge all uncleanness from His Kingdom. <a href="heb2.htm#1">Heb 2:1-4</a>; <a href="heb10.htm#28">10:28,29</a></ol></dl>
