Psalms 102<br> 1. A Prayer of the afflicted, when he is overwhelmed, and poureth out his complaint before the LORD. Hear my prayer, O LORD, and let my cry come unto thee.<br><a name="2">2</a>  Hide not thy face from me in the day [when] I am in trouble; incline thine ear unto me: in the day [when] I call answer me speedily.<br><a name="3">3</a>  For my days are consumed like smoke, and my bones are burned as an hearth.<br><a name="4">4</a>  My heart is smitten, and withered like grass; so that I forget to eat my bread.<br><a name="5">5</a>  By reason of the voice of my groaning my bones cleave to my skin.<br><a name="6">6</a>  I am like a pelican of the wilderness: I am like an owl of the desert.<br><a name="7">7</a>  I watch, and am as a sparrow alone upon the house top.<br><a name="8">8</a>  Mine enemies reproach me all the day; [and] they that are mad against me are sworn against me.<br><a name="9">9</a>  For I have eaten ashes like bread, and mingled my drink with weeping,<br><a name="10">10</a>  Because of thine indignation and thy wrath: for thou hast lifted me up, and cast me down.<br><a name="11">11</a>  My days [are] like a shadow that declineth; and I am withered like grass.<br><a name="12">12</a>. But thou, O LORD, shalt endure for ever; and thy remembrance unto all generations.<br><a name="13">13</a>  Thou shalt arise, [and] have mercy upon Zion: for the time to favour her, yea, the set time, is come.<br><a name="14">14</a>  For thy servants take pleasure in her stones, and favour the dust thereof.<br><a name="15">15</a>  So the heathen shall fear the name of the LORD, and all the kings of the earth thy glory.<br><a name="16">16</a>  When the LORD shall build up Zion, he shall appear in his glory.<br><a name="17">17</a>  He will regard the prayer of the destitute, and not despise their prayer.<br><a name="18">18</a>  This shall be written for the generation to come: and the people which shall be created shall praise the LORD.<br><a name="19">19</a>  For he hath looked down from the height of his sanctuary; from heaven did the LORD behold the earth;<br><a name="20">20</a>  To hear the groaning of the prisoner; to loose those that are appointed to death;<br><a name="21">21</a>  To declare the name of the LORD in Zion, and his praise in Jerusalem;<br><a name="22">22</a>  When the people are gathered together, and the kingdoms, to serve the LORD.<br><a name="23">23</a>. He weakened my strength in the way; he shortened my days.<br><a name="24">24</a>  I said, O my God, take me not away in the midst of my days: thy years [are] throughout all generations.<br><a name="25">25</a>  Of old hast thou laid the foundation of the earth: and the heavens [are] the work of thy hands.<br><a name="26">26</a>  They shall perish, but thou shalt endure: yea, all of them shall wax old like a garment; as a vesture shalt thou change them, and they shall be changed:<br><a name="27">27</a>  But thou [art] the same, and thy years shall have no end.<br><a name="28">28</a>  The children of thy servants shall continue, and their seed shall be established before thee.<br><br>Go to <a href="psa103.htm#1">Psalm 103</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
