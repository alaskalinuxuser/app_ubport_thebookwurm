Romans  12<br> 1. I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that ye present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, [which is] your reasonable service.<br><a name="2">2</a>  And be not conformed to this world: but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what [is] that good, and acceptable, and perfect, will of God.<br><a name="3">3</a>  For I say, through the grace given unto me, to every man that is among you, not to think [of himself] more highly than he ought to think; but to think soberly, according as God hath dealt to every man the measure of faith.<br><a name="4">4</a>  For as we have many members in one body, and all members have not the same office:<br><a name="5">5</a>  So we, [being] many, are one body in Christ, and every one members one of another.<br><a name="6">6</a>  Having then gifts differing according to the grace that is given to us, whether prophecy, [let us prophesy] according to the proportion of faith;<br><a name="7">7</a>  Or ministry, [let us wait] on [our] ministering: or he that teacheth, on teaching;<br><a name="8">8</a>  Or he that exhorteth, on exhortation: he that giveth, [let him do it] with simplicity; he that ruleth, with diligence; he that sheweth mercy, with cheerfulness.<br><a name="9">9</a>  [Let] love be without dissimulation. Abhor that which is evil; cleave to that which is good.<br><a name="10">10</a>  [Be] kindly affectioned one to another with brotherly love; in honour preferring one another;<br><a name="11">11</a>  Not slothful in business; fervent in spirit; serving the Lord;<br><a name="12">12</a>  Rejoicing in hope; patient in tribulation; continuing instant in prayer;<br><a name="13">13</a>  Distributing to the necessity of saints; given to hospitality.<br><a name="14">14</a>  Bless them which persecute you: bless, and curse not.<br><a name="15">15</a>  Rejoice with them that do rejoice, and weep with them that weep.<br><a name="16">16</a>  [Be] of the same mind one toward another. Mind not high things, but condescend to men of low estate. Be not wise in your own conceits.<br><a name="17">17</a>  Recompense to no man evil for evil. Provide things honest in the sight of all men.<br><a name="18">18</a>  If it be possible, as much as lieth in you, live peaceably with all men.<br><a name="19">19</a>  Dearly beloved, avenge not yourselves, but [rather] give place unto wrath: for it is written, Vengeance [is] mine; I will repay, saith the Lord.<br><a name="20">20</a>  Therefore if thine enemy hunger, feed him; if he thirst, give him drink: for in so doing thou shalt heap coals of fire on his head.<br><a name="21">21</a>  Be not overcome of evil, but overcome evil with good.<br><br>Go to <a href="rom13.htm#1">Romans 13</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
