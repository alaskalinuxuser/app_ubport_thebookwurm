<dl><dt><b>Appendix: Judgment upon Gentile nations </b>(continued)-
<dt>IV. Judgment upon the Ammonites (<a href="jer49.htm#1" target="lwr_lt">49:1-6</a>)<ul>
<li>The Ammonites were also descended from Lot (<a href="gen19.htm#36">Gen 19:36-38</a>). They occupied the region east of the Jordan and north of Moab.
<li>The reasons for their judgment:<ol type="1">
<li>Their dispossession of Israel -<ul>
<li>When the ten tribes of Israel were taken captive by Assyria, the Ammonites took possession of the land previously occupied by the tribe of Gad.<dd>Thus, the question of v.1: Why does &quot;their king&quot; {ie., Malcom, Milcom, or Molech, the idol of the Ammonites, whose name means &quot;king&quot;} inherit Gad, and his people {ie., the people of Malcom} inherit his {ie., Gad's} cities? (cp. <a href="eze25.htm#6">Eze 25:6,7</a>)</dd>
<li>Rabbah and Heshbon, chief cities of the Ammonites would be destroyed.<dd>Israel would again return to their inheritance. Today, this region is part of Jordan.</dd></ul>
<li>Their confidence in their wealth (v.4)-<ul>
<li>They would be driven out of their possession (v.5)
<li>Their king {ie., Malcom, their false god} and his priests would go into captivity along with the princes and the people (v.3).</ul></ol>
<li>A promise of restoration &quot;afterward&quot; (v.6)<dd>This promise looks forward to 'the latter days,' as in <a href="jer49.htm#39" target="lwr_lt">v.39</a>.</dd></ul><dt>&nbsp;
<dt>V. Judgment upon Edom (<a href="jer49.htm#7" target="lwr_lt">49:7-22</a>)<ul>
<li>Edom was the land of Esau, located south and southeast of the Dead Sea.
<li>Teman, a city of Edom, was known for wisdom (cp. <a href="obad1.htm#8">Obad 1:8,9</a>; One of Job's counselors was a Temanite, <a href="job2.htm#11">Job 2:11</a>).<dd>However, they had not been wise with respect to Israel (cp. <a href="eze25.htm#12">Eze 25:12-14</a>).</dd>
<li>The calamity of Esau (v.8) would be their complete destruction:<ul>
<li>Nothing would remain. Esau would cease to exist. (v.9,10)
<li>Bozra and her related cities would be a desolation (v13-18).<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;These cities were thought to be impregnable because of their rugged territory. For example, Petra, a city carved into the rock of shear cliffs and accessible only through an easily defensible narrow canyon, was among these cities. (Her setting is described in v.16). Yet, they would be defeated and abandoned, as completely as Sodom and Gomorrah (v.17,18).
<li>This calamity would be a deserved judgment from the LORD. If Israel suffered judgment for their sins, how should Esau think to avoid judgment? (v.12; <a href="jer25.htm#29">Jer 25:29</a>; <a href="mal1.htm#2">Mal 1:2-5</a>; cp. <a href="1pet4.htm#17">1Pet 4:17</a>; <a href="heb12.htm#16">Heb 12:16</a>)<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The fatherless children and widows who trust in the LORD (v.11) may refer to refugees from Israel's captivities. Alternately, the reference may infer the total annihilation of Edom's adult males.</ul>
<li>The conqueror would come suddenly and overtake the land (v.19-22).<dd>Though not identified, the conqueror is Nebuchadnezzar (Babylon). He would make the land desolate, but would not occupy it, and it would not be occupied after he passed through. Even today, the ancient cities of Edom remain unoccupied, except for the tourists who marvel at their ruins.</dd></ul><dt>&nbsp;
<dt>VI. Judgment upon Damascus (<a href="jer49.htm#23" target="lwr_lt">49:23-27</a>)<ul>
<li>Damascus was the capital of Syria. (Judgment is pronounced upon the whole country.)
<li>Sorrow on the sea {or, 'on the seashore;' or, 'anxiety restless as the sea'}- Trouble was coming her way. She would be defenseless against it (v.24-26).<dd>cp. <a href="amos1.htm#3">Amos 1:3-5</a> -- The plain of Aven is an unknown location. Its name may mean &quot;wickedness&quot; or &quotidolatry.&quot; Eden is Beth-Eden, a region of the upper Euphrates. Kir is a region of Mesopotamia to which captives from Damascus had been deported, by the Assyrians, on an earlier occasion (<a href="2kin16.htm#9">2Kin 16:9</a>).
<li>The palace of Ben-Hadad would be consumed (v.27)- At least two kings of Syria, bearing the title 'Ben-Hadad' {ie., son of Hadad},
<dd>are mentioned in their interactions with the kings of Judah and Israel (eg., <a href="1kin15.htm#18">1Kin 15:18</a>; <a href="2kin13.htm#3">2Kin 13:3,24</a>). These interactions alternated between short-lived alliances and long-standing warfare with one kingdom of Israel or the other. The headquarters of Syria's glory years would be swept away, by Babylon.</dd></ul><dt>&nbsp;
<dt>VII. Judgment upon Kedar and Hazor (<a href="jer49.htm#28" target="lwr_lt">49:28-33</a>)<ul>
<li>Kedar and Hazor were nations of nomadic Arabs occupying the northern Arabian desert.<dd>The region of Kedar was to the east of Syria and the Ammonites. The Region of Hazor was nearer to the Persian Gulf.</dd>
<li>Judgment would be at the hand of Nebuchadnezzar, who would overrun their camps.
<li>The people were warned to flee and to dwell deep (in the desert) to escape Babylon's wrath.
<li>Arise, get you up to the wealthy nation... which have neither gates nor bars, which dwell alone.. (v.31,32)-<ul>
<li>Instructions are given to Babylon to overtake Kedar and Hazor, which had long been free of outside oppression, because of their isolation. Today, the wealth of this region is measured, not in camels and cattle, but in barrels of oil. (Actually, the HB words used for camel {gamal, lit., that which serves... benefits... bears} and cattle {miqneh, something bought, possession} could be applied to any commodity.)
<li>It is interesting, that the wording of v.31 is similar to that which elsewhere describes Israel (<a href="num23.htm#9">Num 23:9</a>; <a href="deu33.htm#28">Deu 33:28</a>) and the invasion that will overtake her, in the latter days, during a time of supposed peace (<a href="eze38.htm#11">Eze 38:11</a>). This may be an indication that the ultimate destruction of Arabia (v.33) awaits that future time, as a reward for their role in &quot;the time of Jacob's Trouble&quot; (<a href="jer30.htm#7">Jer 30:7</a>).</ul></ul><dt>&nbsp;
<dt>VIII. Judgment upon Elam (<a href="jer49.htm#34" target="lwr_lt">49:34-39</a>)<ul>
<li>Elam is an old name for Persia, a kingdom located east of the kingdom of Babylon. Elam was allied with Nebuchadnezzar, at the height of his power. Later, they were involved in the conquest of the Babylonian empire, by the Medes and the Persians (as foretold in <a href="isa21.htm#2">Isa 21:2</a>).
<li>About a hundred years before the fall of Jerusalem, Isaiah foresaw that Elam would have a role in the Assyrian and Babylonian invasions of Judah (cp. <a href="isa22.htm#1">Isa 22:1-9</a>).<dd>[For more, see the Book Notes at Isaiah 21:2 and Isaiah 22:1-9.]</dd>
<li>For this, they would experience the LORD's &quot;fierce anger...&quot;
<li>Their might would be broken... they would be scattered to the four winds... to all nations... (v.35-38).<dd>Though human enemies play a role, their judgment is ordered by the LORD. He is their conqueror, as indicated by the phrase: 'I will set my throne in Elam...'</dd>
<li>Yet, in the latter days they will be regathered (v.39). The Lord's grace toward these people is seen in <a href="act2.htm#9">Acts 2:9</a>, where Elamites were among those who heard the Gospel of Christ when it was first preached.</ul></dl>
