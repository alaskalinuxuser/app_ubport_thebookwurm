<dt>the LORD JEHOVAH... is become my salvation {HB= yeshuah (all 3 occurrences in v.2,3)}. -<dd>Observe that salvation is not merely provided by God, nor is it obtained through religious rituals or education. Salvation is in the Person of God Himself.<dd>Verse 2 quotes from <a href="psa118.htm#14">Psa 118:14,21,22</a> (which is a Psalm of the Messiah.)<dd>'Yeshua,' transliterated into Greek, is 'Jesus.' cp. <a href="mat1.htm#21">Mat 1:21</a>; <a href="act4.htm#10">Acts 4:10-12</a>
<dt>water out of the wells of salvation.- cp. <a href="isa55.htm#1">Isa 55:1</a>; <a href="joh4.htm#10">Joh 4:10</a>; <a href="joh7.htm#37">7:37</a>; <a href="rev7.htm#17">Rev 7:17</a>; <a href="rev22.htm#1">22:1,17</a><dd>'Wells' speak of abundance, satisfaction and refreshing for the believing heart.<br>This prophecy speaks of the fulfillment of the feast of Tabernacles, for the Lord will dwell among His people (<a href="isa12.htm#6" target="lwr_lt">v.6</a>). In the days of the second Temple, during the celebration of the feast of Tabernacles, the priests would draw water from the pool of Siloam, carry it to the Temple, and pour it out at the altar as they recited <a href="isa12.htm#3" target="lwr_lt">v.3</a>. That was the occasion of Jesus' words in <a href="joh7.htm#37">Joh 7:37-39</a>. (See the <a href="notemenu.htm" target="lwr_lt">Book Notes</a> at John 7:37-39)</dl><dt>&nbsp;
