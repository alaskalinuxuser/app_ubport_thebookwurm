1Corinthians  12<br>1. Now concerning spiritual [gifts], brethren, I would not have you ignorant.<br><a name="2">2</a>  Ye know that ye were Gentiles, carried away unto these dumb idols, even as ye were led.<br><a name="3">3</a>  Wherefore I give you to understand, that no man speaking by the Spirit of God calleth Jesus accursed: and [that] no man can say that Jesus is the Lord, but by the Holy Ghost.<br><a name="4">4</a>  Now there are diversities of gifts, but the same Spirit.<br><a name="5">5</a>  And there are differences of administrations, but the same Lord.<br><a name="6">6</a>  And there are diversities of operations, but it is the same God which worketh all in all.<br><a name="7">7</a>  But the manifestation of the Spirit is given to every man to profit withal.<br><a name="8">8</a>  For to one is given by the Spirit the word of wisdom; to another the word of knowledge by the same Spirit;<br><a name="9">9</a>  To another faith by the same Spirit; to another the gifts of healing by the same Spirit;<br><a name="10">10</a>  To another the working of miracles; to another prophecy; to another discerning of spirits; to another [divers] kinds of tongues; to another the interpretation of tongues:<br><a name="11">11</a>  But all these worketh that one and the selfsame Spirit, dividing to every man severally as he will.<br><a name="12">12</a>. For as the body is one, and hath many members, and all the members of that one body, being many, are one body: so also [is] Christ.<br><a name="13">13</a>  For by one Spirit are we all baptized into one body, whether [we be] Jews or Gentiles, whether [we be] bond or free; and have been all made to drink into one Spirit.<br><a name="14">14</a>  For the body is not one member, but many.<br><a name="15">15</a>  If the foot shall say, Because I am not the hand, I am not of the body; is it therefore not of the body?<br><a name="16">16</a>  And if the ear shall say, Because I am not the eye, I am not of the body; is it therefore not of the body?<br><a name="17">17</a>  If the whole body [were] an eye, where [were] the hearing? If the whole [were] hearing, where [were] the smelling?<br><a name="18">18</a>  But now hath God set the members every one of them in the body, as it hath pleased him.<br><a name="19">19</a>  And if they were all one member, where [were] the body?<br><a name="20">20</a>  But now [are they] many members, yet but one body.<br><a name="21">21</a>  And the eye cannot say unto the hand, I have no need of thee: nor again the head to the feet, I have no need of you.<br><a name="22">22</a>  Nay, much more those members of the body, which seem to be more feeble, are necessary:<br><a name="23">23</a>  And those [members] of the body, which we think to be less honourable, upon these we bestow more abundant honour; and our uncomely [parts] have more abundant comeliness.<br><a name="24">24</a>  For our comely [parts] have no need: but God hath tempered the body together, having given more abundant honour to that [part] which lacked:<br><a name="25">25</a>  That there should be no schism in the body; but [that] the members should have the same care one for another.<br><a name="26">26</a>  And whether one member suffer, all the members suffer with it; or one member be honoured, all the members rejoice with it.<br><a name="27">27</a>. Now ye are the body of Christ, and members in particular.<br><a name="28">28</a>  And God hath set some in the church, first apostles, secondarily prophets, thirdly teachers, after that miracles, then gifts of healings, helps, governments, diversities of tongues.<br><a name="29">29</a>  [Are] all apostles? [are] all prophets? [are] all teachers? [are] all workers of miracles?<br><a name="30">30</a>  Have all the gifts of healing? do all speak with tongues? do all interpret?<br><a name="31">31</a>  But covet earnestly the best gifts: and yet shew I unto you a more excellent way.<br><br>Go to <a href="1cor13.htm#1">I Corinthians 13</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
