<dl><dt><b>Introduction to Proverbs</b> (Read <a href="pro1.htm#1" target="lwr_lt">Proverbs 1:1-6</a>)<br>&nbsp;
<dt>The Proverbs... - {HB=mashal} is the noun form of a HB verb which means:
<dd>&quot;to rule, or to govern&quot; (<a href="gen1.htm#18">Gen 1:18</a>; <a href="gen3.htm#16">3:16</a>). As the sun, moon and stars preside over the earth, dividing light from darkness, so &quot;the wisdom which cometh from above&quot; (<a href="jam3.htm#17">Jam 3:17</a>) provides light to govern and discern the earthly conduct of mankind. In this book, this wisdom is encapsulated in pithy &quot;proverbs&quot; or &quot;governing principles&quot; by which a person, who heeds them, can order his life and avoid many problems.
<dt>of Solomon... - Solomon is reknown as the wisest man who ever lived.
<dd>But wisdom was not inherent in him, he received it from the Lord (see <a href="1kin3.htm#5">1King 3:5-15</a>; <a href="2chr1.htm#1">2Chr 1:1-13</a>). The wisdom of the proverbs, was not original with Solomon. While sections of the book are attributed to his authorship (<a href="pro10.htm#1">Pro 10:1</a>; <a href="pro25.htm#1">25:1</a>), in many sections, he is repeating the instruction which he received from his parents, as a prince and possible future king (eg., <a href="pro31.htm#4">Pro 31:4</a>). 
<dt>Solomon the son of David, King of Israel...-
<dd>The term &quot;son&quot; reflects on his physical descendancy from his father David. But that is not the only thing inferred by this word. Timothy was Paul's son in the faith. Likewise, Peter called Marcus his son. (<a href="1tim1.htm#2">1Tim 1:2</a>; <a href="1pet5.htm#13">1Pet 5:13</a>). Timothy and Marcus were discipled by their spiritual fathers, assimilating their teaching, and maturing into men of God who were &quot;thoroughly furnished unto all good works.&quot; (<a href="2tim3.htm#17">2Tim 3:17</a>).<ul>
<li>Solomon writes as one who has come to maturity, and has entered into the role for which his father's instructions prepared him (&quot;...son of David, King of Israel&quot;). 
<li>His counsel to sons, repeats the counsel which he received as a son (eg., <a href="pro1.htm#8" target="lwr_lt">Pro 1:8</a>; <a href="pro10.htm#1">10:1</a>). For the most part, Solomon collected and recorded the wisdom which had been passed down from generation to generation (from his father, and also from the forefathers of Israel).</ul>
<dt>to know wisdom, and instruction; to perceive the words of understanding... -
<dd><br><blockquote&quot;The wisdom in this Book is not human sagacity or cleverness or ability, but the application to the smallest details of human life of the wisdom which built the heavens and the earth, and maintains them in being. This is grace indeed, that God should place His wisdom at the disposition of man [to] order man's happiness, and his walking in a safe road in the midst of confusion, evil and danger.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;The Book contrasts the fear of Jehovah and the folly of self-will. The former is declared to be the foundation of wisdom, and prosperity; the latter is denounced as the cause of suffering and death.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;The Book deals with God's moral government in the earth, and is a sure guide amidst life's perplexities. It undertakes to lead men safely whether they be princes or peasants; and to direct them aright in all their concerns, whether public or private.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Rejection of this wisdom is declared by the Book to open the door to corruption and violence. Such was the moral condition of the Antediluvians (<a href="gen6.htm#5">Gen 6:5,11</a>).&quot; [in quotes, GWms]</blockquote>
<dt>wisdom...- What is it? Where does it come from?<ul>
<li>There are six basic words for &quot;wisdom&quot; in the Hebrew Bible. All of them occur in the Proverbs. There are subtle differences in meaning between these words. While each of these words is translated by the English word &quot;wisdom&quot; at least once, in Proverbs, several are more frequently rendered with words like &quot;understanding, discretion, subtilty, prudence.&quot; 
<li>In Proverbs, the first word translated &quot;wisdom&quot; is HB=chokmah (<a href="pro1.htm#2" target="lwr_lt">v.2</a>). This word occurs 141 times in the OT. With only four exceptions, it is translated as &quot;wisdom&quot; (including every occurrence in Proverbs). Its first occurrence is in <a href="ex28.htm#3">Ex 28:3</a>, where it refers to the cunning skill of a craftsman. Observe, however, that this wisdom is not natural to the craftsman, but rather is the effect of God's Spirit within him (<a href="ex31.htm#3">Ex 31:3</a>; <a href="ex35.htm#31">35:31</a>). &quot;<i>Chokmah</i> is the knowledge and the ability to make the right choices at the opportune time.&quot; [Vine] 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Additional words, including but not limited to, the five other basic words for wisdom, are used to amplify or extend the meaning of Wisdom in various ways. This is readily observed in the first few verses of Proverbs. The three words, highlighted below, are among the Hebrew words often translated &quot;wisdom&quot;:
<li><a href="pro1.htm#2" target="lwr_lt">v.2</a> - &quot;<b>understanding</b>&quot; {HB=biynah, wisdom, discernment}. In this verse, the word &quot;perceive&quot; is from the same root word. Wisdom {HB=chokma, skill, shrewdness, prudence} comes through instruction, but must be received with &quot;perceptive understanding.&quot;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The application of the received and perceived wisdom (<a href="pro1.htm#3" target="lwr_lt">v.3</a>) will result in justice {ie., righteousness}, judgment {ie., correct decisions, just execution of the law}, and equity {ie., righteousness and justice that is consistent, without respect of persons, and without change to fit changing circumstances (as in 'situational ethics')}.
<li><a href="pro1.htm#3" target="lwr_lt">v.3</a> - &quot;<b>wisdom</b>&quot; {HB=sakal, insight, prudence, wisdom} is the product of &quot;instruction&quot; {ie., chastening, discipline}. This word for wisdom, first occurs in <a href="gen3.htm#6">Gen 3:6</a> (&quot;to make one wise&quot;). When our first parents partook of that fruit, they gained &quot;insight,&quot; but they would not have gained true wisdom (to understand consequences, and to make wise choices), apart from the Lord's circumspect chastening. &quot;The instruction of wisdom&quot; is the kind of discipline that is righteous, just, and consistent. Such instruction results in:
<li><a href="pro1.htm#4" target="lwr_lt">v.4</a> - &quot;<b>subtilty</b>&quot; {HB='ormah, wisdom: shrewdness, prudence} for the 'simple' {ie., the air headed, the naive, the gullible who are easily led astray}. Like Adam and Eve, a young man or young woman lacks the knowledge that comes through life experience. But the wise young man or woman will receive and apply the instruction that Wisdom offers. By itself, &quot;knowledge&quot; {ie., information} is not wisdom. It must be coupled with &quot;discretion&quot; {or, purpose}, which is knowing how to use that information.</ul>
<dt>In <a href="pro1.htm#5" target="lwr_lt">v.5,6</a>, we see some characteristics of &quot;a wise man&quot; (ie., a man who has received wisdom and subtilty).
<dd>A wise man will:<ul>
<li>&quot;increase learning...&quot; He has a purpose: &quot;to attain unto wise counsels&quot; or to acquire the abiding success which comes from applying sound doctrine. Therefore, he is not content with what he thinks he knows, and.digs below the surface to find the treasures of God's Word. 
<li>seek to understand a proverb {ie., a governing principle} and its interpretation {ie., its enigma, the essential point which is hidden from others}... God has chosen to hide his valuables. He expects man to search them out... whether gold, gems, oil, or intellectual and spiritual resources.<ul> 
<li>The gems of His Word are hidden from those who do not search for them. <a href="pro25.htm#2">Prov 25:2</a>
<li>What has God concealed in His Word? The central theme of scripture is the Person and Work of Christ (<a href="joh5.htm#39">Joh 5:39</a>). Some think (rightly) that the secret of eternal life can be found in the scriptures, but being ignorant of God's Word, they have not found Him. The Jews of Jesus' day were familiar with the Bible. Even so, they did not recognize Him. Today, in our churches, many people have a passing acquaintance with the Bible. They know about Jesus, but they do not know Him. They may even be born again believers, saved and on their way to heaven, but they are not growing in grace and the knowledge of the Lord, because they neglect to seek Him to expound &quot;unto them in all the scriptures the things concerning Himself.&quot; <a href="luk24.htm#27">Luk 24:27</a>; <a href="col2.htm#3">Col 2:3</a>; <a href="col3.htm#16">3:16</a></ul></ul>
<dt><a href="pro1.htm#7" target="lwr_lt">Verse 7</a> is the key verse to the book of Proverbs.
<dd>An attitude of awe filled respect toward the LORD is the beginning of understanding who He is, and of submitting to His governing principles. But many people foolishly despise {ie., hold in contempt, consider as insignificant} the things which they have been told concerning Him, with tragic consequences.<ul>
<li>Wisdom begins and ends with the LORD. Of those who trust in Him, it is written, &quot;but of Him are ye in Christ Jesus, who of God is made unto us wisdom, and righteousness, and sanctification, and redemption: that, according as it is written, He that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord&quot; (<a href="1cor1.htm#30">1Cor 1:30,31</a>).
<li>The Wisdom of God is hidden to the natural man, but revealed by the Holy Spirit, to those who are in Christ (<a href="1cor2.htm#6">1Cor 2:6-8,13-16</a>).
<li>Wisdom is characterized by its fruits: <a href="jam3.htm#13">Jam 3:13-18</a>. These fruits are produced by the Holy Spirit.</ul>
<dd>In <a href="pro1.htm#7" target="lwr_lt">v.7-8</a>, the wisdom from above and the wisdom received from parents are not separated, as though they were distinct from one another, but rather they are seen as parallel, together forming &quot;the foundation of a just relationship to God and man.&quot; [in quotes, GWms]</ul>
