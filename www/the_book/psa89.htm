Psalms  89<br> 1. Maschil of Ethan the Ezrahite. I will sing of the mercies of the LORD for ever: with my mouth will I make known thy faithfulness to all generations.<br><a name="2">2</a>  For I have said, Mercy shall be built up for ever: thy faithfulness shalt thou establish in the very heavens.<br><a name="3">3</a>  I have made a covenant with my chosen, I have sworn unto David my servant,<br><a name="4">4</a>  Thy seed will I establish for ever, and build up thy throne to all generations. Selah.<br><a name="5">5</a>. And the heavens shall praise thy wonders, O LORD: thy faithfulness also in the congregation of the saints.<br><a name="6">6</a>  For who in the heaven can be compared unto the LORD? [who] among the sons of the mighty can be likened unto the LORD?<br><a name="7">7</a>  God is greatly to be feared in the assembly of the saints, and to be had in reverence of all [them that are] about him.<br><a name="8">8</a>  O LORD God of hosts, who [is] a strong LORD like unto thee? or to thy faithfulness round about thee?<br><a name="9">9</a>  Thou rulest the raging of the sea: when the waves thereof arise, thou stillest them.<br><a name="10">10</a>  Thou hast broken Rahab in pieces, as one that is slain; thou hast scattered thine enemies with thy strong arm.<br><a name="11">11</a>  The heavens [are] thine, the earth also [is] thine: [as for] the world and the fulness thereof, thou hast founded them.<br><a name="12">12</a>  The north and the south thou hast created them: Tabor and Hermon shall rejoice in thy name.<br><a name="13">13</a>  Thou hast a mighty arm: strong is thy hand, [and] high is thy right hand.<br><a name="14">14</a>  Justice and judgment [are] the habitation of thy throne: mercy and truth shall go before thy face.<br><a name="15">15</a>. Blessed [is] the people that know the joyful sound: they shall walk, O LORD, in the light of thy countenance.<br><a name="16">16</a>  In thy name shall they rejoice all the day: and in thy righteousness shall they be exalted.<br><a name="17">17</a>  For thou [art] the glory of their strength: and in thy favour our horn shall be exalted.<br><a name="18">18</a>  For the LORD [is] our defence; and the Holy One of Israel [is] our king.<br><a name="19">19</a>. Then thou spakest in vision to thy holy one, and saidst, I have laid help upon [one that is] mighty; I have exalted [one] chosen out of the people.<br><a name="20">20</a>  I have found David my servant; with my holy oil have I anointed him:<br><a name="21">21</a>  With whom my hand shall be established: mine arm also shall strengthen him.<br><a name="22">22</a>  The enemy shall not exact upon him; nor the son of wickedness afflict him.<br><a name="23">23</a>  And I will beat down his foes before his face, and plague them that hate him.<br><a name="24">24</a>  But my faithfulness and my mercy [shall be] with him: and in my name shall his horn be exalted.<br><a name="25">25</a>  I will set his hand also in the sea, and his right hand in the rivers.<br><a name="26">26</a>  He shall cry unto me, Thou [art] my father, my God, and the rock of my salvation.<br><a name="27">27</a>  Also I will make him [my] firstborn, higher than the kings of the earth.<br><a name="28">28</a>  My mercy will I keep for him for evermore, and my covenant shall stand fast with him.<br><a name="29">29</a>  His seed also will I make [to endure] for ever, and his throne as the days of heaven.<br><a name="30">30</a>  If his children forsake my law, and walk not in my judgments;<br><a name="31">31</a>  If they break my statutes, and keep not my commandments;<br><a name="32">32</a>  Then will I visit their transgression with the rod, and their iniquity with stripes.<br><a name="33">33</a>  Nevertheless my lovingkindness will I not utterly take from him, nor suffer my faithfulness to fail.<br><a name="34">34</a>  My covenant will I not break, nor alter the thing that is gone out of my lips.<br><a name="35">35</a>  Once have I sworn by my holiness that I will not lie unto David.<br><a name="36">36</a>  His seed shall endure for ever, and his throne as the sun before me.<br><a name="37">37</a>  It shall be established for ever as the moon, and [as] a faithful witness in heaven. Selah.<br><a name="38">38</a>. But thou hast cast off and abhorred, thou hast been wroth with thine anointed.<br><a name="39">39</a>  Thou hast made void the covenant of thy servant: thou hast profaned his crown [by casting it] to the ground.<br><a name="40">40</a>  Thou hast broken down all his hedges; thou hast brought his strong holds to ruin.<br><a name="41">41</a>  All that pass by the way spoil him: he is a reproach to his neighbours.<br><a name="42">42</a>  Thou hast set up the right hand of his adversaries; thou hast made all his enemies to rejoice.<br><a name="43">43</a>  Thou hast also turned the edge of his sword, and hast not made him to stand in the battle.<br><a name="44">44</a>  Thou hast made his glory to cease, and cast his throne down to the ground.<br><a name="45">45</a>  The days of his youth hast thou shortened: thou hast covered him with shame. Selah.<br><a name="46">46</a>  How long, LORD? wilt thou hide thyself for ever? shall thy wrath burn like fire?<br><a name="47">47</a>  Remember how short my time is: wherefore hast thou made all men in vain?<br><a name="48">48</a>  What man [is he that] liveth, and shall not see death? shall he deliver his soul from the hand of the grave? Selah.<br><a name="49">49</a>  Lord, where [are] thy former lovingkindnesses, [which] thou swarest unto David in thy truth?<br><a name="50">50</a>  Remember, Lord, the reproach of thy servants; [how] I do bear in my bosom [the reproach of] all the mighty people;<br><a name="51">51</a>  Wherewith thine enemies have reproached, O LORD; wherewith they have reproached the footsteps of thine anointed.<br><a name="52">52</a>  Blessed [be] the LORD for evermore.
