<dl><dt><b>The Voice of Wisdom - The Identification of Wisdom's Person</b>
<p>In the first half of Proverbs chapter 8, Wisdom personified makes her appeal to the simple. The voice of Wisdom speaks in stark contrast to that of the &quot;strange woman,&quot; though both voices can be heard everywhere that men can be found (in the streets and places of commerce), and though they address the same men: those devoid of understanding.  The strange woman seeks to deceive and seduce, and leads her followers to death and destruction. Wisdom seeks to expose the deceitfulness of wickedness, and leads to eternal life and lasting treasure of greater value than gold.</p>
<p>In the second half of Proverbs ch. 8, Wisdom is not only personified, but identified, for the characteristics of Wisdom are those of our Lord Jesus Christ, who is also known as &quot;the Wisdom of God&quot; (<a href="1cor1.htm#23">1Cor 1:23,24,30</a>).</p>
<dd>Characteristics of the Person of Wisdom:<ol type="1">
<li>Wisdom is Eternal, <a href="pro8.htm#22" target="lwr_lt">Prov 8:22-26</a>
<li>Wisdom is Essential to creation, <a href="pro8.htm#27" target="lwr_lt">8:27-29</a>
<li>Wisdom is Equal with God, <a href="pro8.htm#30" target="lwr_lt">8:30,31</a>
<li>Wisdom appeals to the Ears of men, <a href="pro8.htm#32" target="lwr_lt">8:32,33</a>
<li>Wisdom Elaborates its blessings, <a href="pro8.htm#34" target="lwr_lt">8:34,35</a>
