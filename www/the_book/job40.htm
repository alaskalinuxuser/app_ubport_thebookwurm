Job  40<br>1. Moreover the LORD answered Job, and said,<br><a name="2">2</a>  Shall he that contendeth with the Almighty instruct [him]? he that reproveth God, let him answer it.<br><a name="3">3</a>  Then Job answered the LORD, and said,<br><a name="4">4</a>  Behold, I am vile; what shall I answer thee? I will lay mine hand upon my mouth.<br><a name="5">5</a>  Once have I spoken; but I will not answer: yea, twice; but I will proceed no further.<br><a name="6">6</a>. Then answered the LORD unto Job out of the whirlwind, and said,<br><a name="7">7</a>  Gird up thy loins now like a man: I will demand of thee, and declare thou unto me.<br><a name="8">8</a>  Wilt thou also disannul my judgment? wilt thou condemn me, that thou mayest be righteous?<br><a name="9">9</a>  Hast thou an arm like God? or canst thou thunder with a voice like him?<br><a name="10">10</a>  Deck thyself now [with] majesty and excellency; and array thyself with glory and beauty.<br><a name="11">11</a>  Cast abroad the rage of thy wrath: and behold every one [that is] proud, and abase him.<br><a name="12">12</a>  Look on every one [that is] proud, [and] bring him low; and tread down the wicked in their place.<br><a name="13">13</a>  Hide them in the dust together; [and] bind their faces in secret.<br><a name="14">14</a>  Then will I also confess unto thee that thine own right hand can save thee.<br><a name="15">15</a>. Behold now behemoth, which I made with thee; he eateth grass as an ox.<br><a name="16">16</a>  Lo now, his strength [is] in his loins, and his force [is] in the navel of his belly.<br><a name="17">17</a>  He moveth his tail like a cedar: the sinews of his stones are wrapped together.<br><a name="18">18</a>  His bones [are as] strong pieces of brass; his bones [are] like bars of iron.<br><a name="19">19</a>  He [is] the chief of the ways of God: he that made him can make his sword to approach [unto him].<br><a name="20">20</a>  Surely the mountains bring him forth food, where all the beasts of the field play.<br><a name="21">21</a>  He lieth under the shady trees, in the covert of the reed, and fens.<br><a name="22">22</a>  The shady trees cover him [with] their shadow; the willows of the brook compass him about.<br><a name="23">23</a>  Behold, he drinketh up a river, [and] hasteth not: he trusteth that he can draw up Jordan into his mouth.<br><a name="24">24</a>  He taketh it with his eyes: [his] nose pierceth through snares.<br><br>Go to <a href="job41.htm#1">Job 41</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
