Genesis  26<br>1. And there was a famine in the land, beside the first famine that was in the days of Abraham. And Isaac went unto Abimelech king of the Philistines unto Gerar.<br><a name="2">2</a>  And the LORD appeared unto him, and said, Go not down into Egypt; dwell in the land which I shall tell thee of:<br><a name="3">3</a>  Sojourn in this land, and I will be with thee, and will bless thee; for unto thee, and unto thy seed, I will give all these countries, and I will perform the oath which I sware unto Abraham thy father;<br><a name="4">4</a>  And I will make thy seed to multiply as the stars of heaven, and will give unto thy seed all these countries; and in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed;<br><a name="5">5</a>  Because that Abraham obeyed my voice, and kept my charge, my commandments, my statutes, and my laws.<br><a name="6">6</a>. And Isaac dwelt in Gerar:<br><a name="7">7</a>  And the men of the place asked [him] of his wife; and he said, She [is] my sister: for he feared to say, [She is] my wife; lest, [said he], the men of the place should kill me for Rebekah; because she [was] fair to look upon.<br><a name="8">8</a>  And it came to pass, when he had been there a long time, that Abimelech king of the Philistines looked out at a window, and saw, and, behold, Isaac [was] sporting with Rebekah his wife.<br><a name="9">9</a>  And Abimelech called Isaac, and said, Behold, of a surety she [is] thy wife: and how saidst thou, She [is] my sister? And Isaac said unto him, Because I said, Lest I die for her.<br><a name="10">10</a>  And Abimelech said, What [is] this thou hast done unto us? one of the people might lightly have lien with thy wife, and thou shouldest have brought guiltiness upon us.<br><a name="11">11</a>  And Abimelech charged all [his] people, saying, He that toucheth this man or his wife shall surely be put to death.<br><a name="12">12</a>. Then Isaac sowed in that land, and received in the same year an hundredfold: and the LORD blessed him.<br><a name="13">13</a>  And the man waxed great, and went forward, and grew until he became very great:<br><a name="14">14</a>  For he had possession of flocks, and possession of herds, and great store of servants: and the Philistines envied him.<br><a name="15">15</a>  For all the wells which his father's servants had digged in the days of Abraham his father, the Philistines had stopped them, and filled them with earth.<br><a name="16">16</a>  And Abimelech said unto Isaac, Go from us; for thou art much mightier than we.<br><a name="17">17</a>  And Isaac departed thence, and pitched his tent in the valley of Gerar, and dwelt there.<br><a name="18">18</a>  And Isaac digged again the wells of water, which they had digged in the days of Abraham his father; for the Philistines had stopped them after the death of Abraham: and he called their names after the names by which his father had called them.<br><a name="19">19</a>  And Isaac's servants digged in the valley, and found there a well of springing water.<br><a name="20">20</a>  And the herdmen of Gerar did strive with Isaac's herdmen, saying, The water [is] ours: and he called the name of the well Esek; because they strove with him.<br><a name="21">21</a>  And they digged another well, and strove for that also: and he called the name of it Sitnah.<br><a name="22">22</a>  And he removed from thence, and digged another well; and for that they strove not: and he called the name of it Rehoboth; and he said, For now the LORD hath made room for us, and we shall be fruitful in the land.<br><a name="23">23</a>  And he went up from thence to Beersheba.<br><a name="24">24</a>  And the LORD appeared unto him the same night, and said, I [am] the God of Abraham thy father: fear not, for I [am] with thee, and will bless thee, and multiply thy seed for my servant Abraham's sake.<br><a name="25">25</a>  And he builded an altar there, and called upon the name of the LORD, and pitched his tent there: and there Isaac's servants digged a well.<br><a name="26">26</a>. Then Abimelech went to him from Gerar, and Ahuzzath one of his friends, and Phichol the chief captain of his army.<br><a name="27">27</a>  And Isaac said unto them, Wherefore come ye to me, seeing ye hate me, and have sent me away from you?<br><a name="28">28</a>  And they said, We saw certainly that the LORD was with thee: and we said, Let there be now an oath betwixt us, [even] betwixt us and thee, and let us make a covenant with thee;<br><a name="29">29</a>  That thou wilt do us no hurt, as we have not touched thee, and as we have done unto thee nothing but good, and have sent thee away in peace: thou [art] now the blessed of the LORD.<br><a name="30">30</a>  And he made them a feast, and they did eat and drink.<br><a name="31">31</a>  And they rose up betimes in the morning, and sware one to another: and Isaac sent them away, and they departed from him in peace.<br><a name="32">32</a>  And it came to pass the same day, that Isaac's servants came, and told him concerning the well which they had digged, and said unto him, We have found water.<br><a name="33">33</a>  And he called it Shebah: therefore the name of the city [is] Beersheba unto this day.<br><a name="34">34</a>. And Esau was forty years old when he took to wife Judith the daughter of Beeri the Hittite, and Bashemath the daughter of Elon the Hittite:<br><a name="35">35</a>  Which were a grief of mind unto Isaac and to Rebekah.<br><br>Go to <a href="gen27.htm#1">Genesis 27</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
