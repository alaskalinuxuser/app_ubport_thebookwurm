Esther   7<br>1. So the king and Haman came to banquet with Esther the queen.<br><a name="2">2</a>  And the king said again unto Esther on the second day at the banquet of wine, What [is] thy petition, queen Esther? and it shall be granted thee: and what [is] thy request? and it shall be performed, [even] to the half of the kingdom.<br><a name="3">3</a>  Then Esther the queen answered and said, If I have found favour in thy sight, O king, and if it please the king, let my life be given me at my petition, and my people at my request:<br><a name="4">4</a>  For we are sold, I and my people, to be destroyed, to be slain, and to perish.
