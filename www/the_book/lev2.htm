Leviticus   2<br>1. And when any will offer a meat offering unto the LORD, his offering shall be [of] fine flour; and he shall pour oil upon it, and put frankincense thereon:<br><a name="2">2</a>  And he shall bring it to Aaron's sons the priests: and he shall take thereout his handful of the flour thereof, and of the oil thereof, with all the frankincense thereof; and the priest shall burn the memorial of it upon the altar, [to be] an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the LORD:<br><a name="3">3</a>  And the remnant of the meat offering [shall be] Aaron's and his sons': [it is] a thing most holy of the offerings of the LORD made by fire.<br><a name="4">4</a>  And if thou bring an oblation of a meat offering baken in the oven, [it shall be] unleavened cakes of fine flour mingled with oil, or unleavened wafers anointed with oil.<br><a name="5">5</a>  And if thy oblation [be] a meat offering [baken] in a pan, it shall be [of] fine flour unleavened, mingled with oil.<br><a name="6">6</a>  Thou shalt part it in pieces, and pour oil thereon: it [is] a meat offering.<br><a name="7">7</a>  And if thy oblation [be] a meat offering [baken] in the fryingpan, it shall be made [of] fine flour with oil.<br><a name="8">8</a>  And thou shalt bring the meat offering that is made of these things unto the LORD: and when it is presented unto the priest, he shall bring it unto the altar.<br><a name="9">9</a>  And the priest shall take from the meat offering a memorial thereof, and shall burn [it] upon the altar: [it is] an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the LORD.<br><a name="10">10</a>  And that which is left of the meat offering [shall be] Aaron's and his sons': [it is] a thing most holy of the offerings of the LORD made by fire.<br><a name="11">11</a>. No meat offering, which ye shall bring unto the LORD, shall be made with leaven: for ye shall burn no leaven, nor any honey, in any offering of the LORD made by fire.<br><a name="12">12</a>  As for the oblation of the firstfruits, ye shall offer them unto the LORD: but they shall not be burnt on the altar for a sweet savour.<br><a name="13">13</a>  And every oblation of thy meat offering shalt thou season with salt; neither shalt thou suffer the salt of the covenant of thy God to be lacking from thy meat offering: with all thine offerings thou shalt offer salt.<br><a name="14">14</a>  And if thou offer a meat offering of thy firstfruits unto the LORD, thou shalt offer for the meat offering of thy firstfruits green ears of corn dried by the fire, [even] corn beaten out of full ears.<br><a name="15">15</a>  And thou shalt put oil upon it, and lay frankincense thereon: it [is] a meat offering.<br><a name="16">16</a>  And the priest shall burn the memorial of it, [part] of the beaten corn thereof, and [part] of the oil thereof, with all the frankincense thereof: [it is] an offering made by fire unto the LORD.<br><br>Go to <a href="lev3.htm#1">Leviticus 3</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
