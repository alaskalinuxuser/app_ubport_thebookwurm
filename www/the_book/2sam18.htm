2Samuel  18<br>1. And David numbered the people that [were] with him, and set captains of thousands and captains of hundreds over them.<br><a name="2">2</a>  And David sent forth a third part of the people under the hand of Joab, and a third part under the hand of Abishai the son of Zeruiah, Joab's brother, and a third part under the hand of Ittai the Gittite. And the king said unto the people, I will surely go forth with you myself also.<br><a name="3">3</a>  But the people answered, Thou shalt not go forth: for if we flee away, they will not care for us; neither if half of us die, will they care for us: but now [thou art] worth ten thousand of us: therefore now [it is] better that thou succour us out of the city.<br><a name="4">4</a>  And the king said unto them, What seemeth you best I will do. And the king stood by the gate side, and all the people came out by hundreds and by thousands.<br><a name="5">5</a>  And the king commanded Joab and Abishai and Ittai, saying, [Deal] gently for my sake with the young man, [even] with Absalom. And all the people heard when the king gave all the captains charge concerning Absalom.<br><a name="6">6</a>  So the people went out into the field against Israel: and the battle was in the wood of Ephraim;<br><a name="7">7</a>  Where the people of Israel were slain before the servants of David, and there was there a great slaughter that day of twenty thousand [men].<br><a name="8">8</a>  For the battle was there scattered over the face of all the country: and the wood devoured more people that day than the sword devoured.<br><a name="9">9</a>. And Absalom met the servants of David. And Absalom rode upon a mule, and the mule went under the thick boughs of a great oak, and his head caught hold of the oak, and he was taken up between the heaven and the earth; and the mule that [was] under him went away.<br><a name="10">10</a>  And a certain man saw [it], and told Joab, and said, Behold, I saw Absalom hanged in an oak.<br><a name="11">11</a>  And Joab said unto the man that told him, And, behold, thou sawest [him], and why didst thou not smite him there to the ground? and I would have given thee ten [shekels] of silver, and a girdle.<br><a name="12">12</a>  And the man said unto Joab, Though I should receive a thousand [shekels] of silver in mine hand, [yet] would I not put forth mine hand against the king's son: for in our hearing the king charged thee and Abishai and Ittai, saying, Beware that none [touch] the young man Absalom.<br><a name="13">13</a>  Otherwise I should have wrought falsehood against mine own life: for there is no matter hid from the king, and thou thyself wouldest have set thyself against [me].<br><a name="14">14</a>  Then said Joab, I may not tarry thus with thee. And he took three darts in his hand, and thrust them through the heart of Absalom, while he [was] yet alive in the midst of the oak.<br><a name="15">15</a>  And ten young men that bare Joab's armour compassed about and smote Absalom, and slew him.<br><a name="16">16</a>  And Joab blew the trumpet, and the people returned from pursuing after Israel: for Joab held back the people.<br><a name="17">17</a>  And they took Absalom, and cast him into a great pit in the wood, and laid a very great heap of stones upon him: and all Israel fled every one to his tent.<br><a name="18">18</a>  Now Absalom in his lifetime had taken and reared up for himself a pillar, which [is] in the king's dale: for he said, I have no son to keep my name in remembrance: and he called the pillar after his own name: and it is called unto this day, Absalom's place.<br><a name="19">19</a>. Then said Ahimaaz the son of Zadok, Let me now run, and bear the king tidings, how that the LORD hath avenged him of his enemies.<br><a name="20">20</a>  And Joab said unto him, Thou shalt not bear tidings this day, but thou shalt bear tidings another day: but this day thou shalt bear no tidings, because the king's son is dead.<br><a name="21">21</a>  Then said Joab to Cushi, Go tell the king what thou hast seen. And Cushi bowed himself unto Joab, and ran.<br><a name="22">22</a>  Then said Ahimaaz the son of Zadok yet again to Joab, But howsoever, let me, I pray thee, also run after Cushi. And Joab said, Wherefore wilt thou run, my son, seeing that thou hast no tidings ready?<br><a name="23">23</a>  But howsoever, [said he], let me run. And he said unto him, Run. Then Ahimaaz ran by the way of the plain, and overran Cushi.<br><a name="24">24</a>  And David sat between the two gates: and the watchman went up to the roof over the gate unto the wall, and lifted up his eyes, and looked, and behold a man running alone.<br><a name="25">25</a>  And the watchman cried, and told the king. And the king said, If he [be] alone, [there is] tidings in his mouth. And he came apace, and drew near.<br><a name="26">26</a>  And the watchman saw another man running: and the watchman called unto the porter, and said, Behold [another] man running alone. And the king said, He also bringeth tidings.<br><a name="27">27</a>  And the watchman said, Me thinketh the running of the foremost is like the running of Ahimaaz the son of Zadok. And the king said, He [is] a good man, and cometh with good tidings.<br><a name="28">28</a>  And Ahimaaz called, and said unto the king, All is well. And he fell down to the earth upon his face before the king, and said, Blessed [be] the LORD thy God, which hath delivered up the men that lifted up their hand against my lord the king.<br><a name="29">29</a>  And the king said, Is the young man Absalom safe? And Ahimaaz answered, When Joab sent the king's servant, and [me] thy servant, I saw a great tumult, but I knew not what [it was].<br><a name="30">30</a>  And the king said [unto him], Turn aside, [and] stand here. And he turned aside, and stood still.<br><a name="31">31</a>  And, behold, Cushi came; and Cushi said, Tidings, my lord the king: for the LORD hath avenged thee this day of all them that rose up against thee.<br><a name="32">32</a>  And the king said unto Cushi, Is the young man Absalom safe? And Cushi answered, The enemies of my lord the king, and all that rise against thee to do [thee] hurt, be as [that] young man [is].<br><a name="33">33</a>  And the king was much moved, and went up to the chamber over the gate, and wept: and as he went, thus he said, O my son Absalom, my son, my son Absalom! would God I had died for thee, O Absalom, my son, my son!<br><br>Go to <a href="2sam19.htm#1">II Samuel 19</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
