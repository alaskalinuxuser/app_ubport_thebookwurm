<b><i>15:1  I am the true vine, and my Father is the husbandman.<br>
15:2  Every branch in me that beareth not fruit he taketh away:<br>
and every [branch] that beareth fruit, he purgeth it, that it may bring forth more fruit.<br>
15:3  Now ye are clean through the word which I have spoken unto you.</i></b></dt><dl>
<dt>I am the true vine.- This is the last of Jesus' &quot;I am...&quot; statements. <dd>(See also <a href="joh6.htm#35">6:35</a>; <a href="joh8.htm#12">8:12</a>; <a href="joh8.htm#58">8:58</a>; <a href="joh10.htm#7">10:7</a>; <a href="joh10.htm#11">10:11</a>; <a href="joh11.htm#25">11:25</a>; <a href="joh14.htm#6">14:6</a>)
<dd>Jesus may have spoken these words as He and the disciples made their way from the upper room to the garden of Gethsemane (cp. <a href="joh14.htm#31">14:31</a>)... perhaps, as they passed a vineyard in the Kidron valley ...or perhaps as they passed by, or through, the Temple. The great bronze gates of the Temple were inlaid with a golden vine which symbolized the nation of Israel. cp. <a href="psa80.htm#8">Psa 80:8,9</a><br>
But Israel, Jehovah's vine had not been true to Him. <a href="isa5.htm#1">Isa 5:1-7</a>; <a href="jer2.htm#21">Jer 2:21</a>; <a href="hos10.htm#1">Hos 10:1</a><br>
Jesus, the true {ie., genuine} Vine, brought forth the fruit that Israel failed to bear.<ul><li>What is the essense of that fruit?<dd>Love for the Father, and obedience to His will (<a href="joh14.htm#31">Joh 14:31</a>).</dd><dd>This is the fruit which the Father desires to see on every branch of the Vine.</dd></ul>
<dt>My Father is the husbandman {ie., vinedresser}.- 
<dd>The Father, seeking fruit from the true Vine (ie., Christ, cp. <a href="isa53.htm#2">Isa 53:2</a>),<br>tends to His branches (those who are &quot;in me&quot;).
<dt>every branch in me that beareth not fruit, He taketh away {GK= airo, to lift off}.-
<dd>Does this mean that a believer can lose his salvation?<br>
<i>No!</i> (cp. <a href="joh3.htm#16">3:16</a>; <a href="joh5.htm#24">5:24</a>; <a href="joh10.htm#28">10:28,29</a>) - &quot;No fruit&quot; may be produced by either...<ol type="a">
<li>A dead branch (ie., from another plant), which may <i>appear</i> to be part of the vine,<dd>
but having never been in vital union with the vine, it bears no fruit, and can be easily lifted off.<br>
Such false branches never were saved, and are consigned to eternal fire (eg., false disciples, like Judas Iscariot, cp. <a href="joh13.htm#10">13:10,11</a>; <a href="mat13.htm#30">Mat 13:30</a>; <a href="jude1.htm#12">Jude 1:12,13</a>).</dd>
<li>A withered branch (<a href="joh15.htm#6" target="lwr_lt">v.6</a>), ie., a carnal Christian,<dd>who clinging to his own fleshly ways, hinders the life of the vine from working in him. Such fruit as he appears to bear will not stand the Father's test. cp. <a href="1cor3.htm#11">1 Cor 3:11-15</a></dd><dd>Such branches, though saved from eternal condemnation, may be 'taken away' from the place of fruit bearing (ie., this earthly life, cp. <a href="php1.htm#22">Php 1:22</a>). (eg., those whose lives are not consistent with their professed communion with Christ, <a href="1cor11.htm#27">1Cor 11:27-32</a>)</dd><dt>&quot;In ch. 15, Jesus is speaking to His disciples. The question is not salvation but <i>fruitfulness</i>.&quot; [McGee]</ol>
<dt>every branch... that beareth fruit, He purgeth {GK= kathairo, to cleanse, to prune}-<ol type="A">
<li>God's purpose for pruning: <a href="joh15.htm#2" target="lwr_lt">v.2</a><ul><li>Pruning removes unfruitful side shoots, which hinder the production of good fruit.<li>Pruning is not painless, but it is profitable. <a href="heb12.htm#5">Heb 12:5-11</a></ul>

<b><i>15:4  Abide in me, and I in you.<br>
As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself, except it abide in the vine;<br>
no more can ye, except ye abide in me.<br>
15:5  I am the vine, ye [are] the branches:<br>
He that abideth in me, and I in him, the same bringeth forth much fruit:<br>
for without me ye can do nothing.</i></b></dt><dl>
<dt>abide- GK= meno, to remain, to dwell, to continue. (occurs 11x in ch. 15)
<dd>abide in me... the vine- He is Life, and the source of Life (<a href="joh1.htm#4">1:4</a>).
<dt>the branch cannot bear fruit of itself - because it has no life in itself.
<dd>He does <i>not</i> tell us to bring forth fruit (though He wants to see fruit in us, <a href="joh15.htm#2" target="lwr_lt">v.2,8</a>).
<dd>Rather, He tells us to <i>&quot;abide in Me.&quot;</i> The business of a branch is to be filled with the life of the Vine, only then can it be fruitful. Take a look at a tomato vine: a branch is largest and strongest where it is joined to the vine, but it holds its fruit by the slenderest of twigs. It is the life of the Vine, which brings forth fruit.</dl><dt>
<b><i>15:6  If a man abide not in me, he is cast forth as a branch, and is withered;<br>
and men gather them, and cast [them] into the fire, and they are burned.<br>
15:7  If ye abide in me, and my words abide in you,<br>
ye shall ask what ye will, and it shall be done unto you.<br>
15:8  Herein is my Father glorified, that ye bear much fruit; so shall ye be my disciples.</i></b></dt><dl>
<dt>The Father's purpose for a branch is to bear fruit.<ul>
<li>A branch that responds to the Father's tending will grow in fruitfulness:<dd>&quot;fruit... more fruit (<a href="joh15.htm#2" target="lwr_lt">v.2</a>)... much fruit&quot; (<a href="joh15.htm#5" target="lwr_lt">v.5,8</a>).</dd>
<li>A branch that is fruitless is worthless. (cp. <a href="eze15.htm#2">Ezek 15:2-7</a>)<dd>Regarding &quot;cast into the fire,&quot; see note at <a href="joh15.htm#2" target="lwr_lt">v.2</a> above; <a href="1cor3.htm#11">1Cor 3:11-15</a></dd></ul>
<dt>What fruit does the Father desire? 
<dd>Only those things that His Holy Spirit produces in and through the believer. <a href="gal5.htm#22">Gal 5:22-25</a>; <a href="eph5.htm#9">Eph 5:9</a>; <a href="col1.htm#9">Col 1:9-11</a>
<dd>All else is worthless to Him. cp. <a href="zech4.htm#6">Zech 4:6</a>; <a href="rom8.htm#4">Rom 8:4-8</a>; <a href="1cor2.htm#4">1Cor 2:4,5</a>
<dt>To abide in Christ is to live by continual dependence upon, and fellowship with, Him.<dd>&quot;To abide in Christ is, on the one hand, to have no known sin unjudged and unconfessed, no interest into which He is not brought, no life which He cannot share. On the other hand, the abiding one takes all burdens to Him, and draws all wisdom, life and strength from Him. It is not unceasing <i>consciousness</i> of these things, and of Him, but that nothing is allowed in the life which separates from Him.&quot; [ScofRB]
<dt>How can I abide in Christ? -<ol type="1">
<li>believe in (trust in) Him for salvation. The Holy Spirit joins the believer to Christ.<br>

<dt>in this my Father is glorified... so shall ye be my disciples-

They bear fruit, to His glory, only in the degree that they abide in Christ.
