<dl><dt>
<b><i>18:1 At the same time came the disciples unto Jesus, saying,<br>
Who is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven?<br>
18:2 And Jesus called a little child unto him, and set him in the midst of them,<br>
18:3 And said, Verily I say unto you,<br>
Except ye be converted, and become as little children,<br>
ye shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven.<br>
18:4 Whosoever therefore shall humble himself as this little child,<br>
the same is greatest in the kingdom of heaven.<br>
18:5 And whoso shall receive one such little child in my name receiveth me.<br>
18:6 But whoso shall offend one of these little ones which believe in me,<br>
it were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck,<br>
and [that] he were drowned in the depth of the sea.</i></b></dt><dl>
<dt>at the same time...- When? (see also <a href="mar9.htm#30">Mark 9:30-50</a>; <a href="luk9.htm#43">Luk 9:43-50</a>)
<dd>Around the time that...<ul>
<li>He presented Himself as the Rock upon which He is building His church (<a href="mat16.htm#16">Mat 16:16-18</a>).
<li>He was transfigured before them in a preview of His glory in His future Kingdom (<a href="mat17.htm#1">Mat 17:1-8</a>).
<li>He had cast out a demon which the disciples were unable to displace (<a href="mat17.htm#14">Mat 17:14-21</a>).
<li>He reminded them of His approaching crucifixion (<a href="mat17.htm#22">17:22,23</a>), 
<li>He exercised His dominion over creation to pay tribute, though the King and His children ought to be exempt (<a href="mat17.htm#24">Mat 17:24-27</a>)</ul>
These events, separately and together, demonstrated that &quot;the greatest in the Kingdom&quot; is Jesus.</ul>
<dt>Who is the greatest in the kingdom?- 
<dd>The disciples were concerned with their <i>position</i> in the kingdom.<br>
Jesus tells them their concern should be <i>entrance</i> into the kingdom. <a href="mat18.htm#3" target="lwr_lt">v.3</a><br>
When Jesus spoke of His approaching death, they were 'sorry' and 'afraid to ask' what that meant (<a href="mar9.htm#31">Mar 9:31,32</a>)...
they set aside what was of primary importance, in their pursuit of <i>self</i> importance.
<dt>Except ye be converted, and become as little children, ye shall not enter...-<ul>
<li>converted - GK=strepho, to turn about. 
<dd>Entrance into the Kingdom of Heaven requires a complete reversal of our natural state, of sin and prideful self-exaltation. Conversion involves a radical change, a new beginning, which is like starting over again as a little child. <a href="mat13.htm#15">Mat 13:15</a>; <a href="psa51.htm#10">Psa 51:10-13</a>; <a href="jam5.htm#19">Jam 5:19-20</a>; <a href="mat5.htm#20">Mat 5:20</a>
<li>become as little children- Two aspects are in view...<ul>
<li>the new birth, by which a sinner becomes a child of God. cp. <a href="joh1.htm#12">Joh 1:12,13</a>; <a href="joh3.htm#3">3:3-6</a>; <a href="1pet1.htm#23">1Pet 1:23</a>
<li>a humble, trusting and dependent heart, like that of a little child (<a href="mat18.htm#4" target="lwr_lt">v.4</a>).-
<dd>Humility is characteristic of God's children, as modeled by His greatest Son. <a href="isa57.htm#15">Isa 57:15</a>; <a href="mat23.htm#11">Mat 23:11,12</a>; <a href="php2.htm#3">Php 2:3-8</a>; <a href="1pet2.htm#2">1Pet 2:2</a></dd></ul></ul>
<dt>whosoever shall receive one such... (<a href="mat18.htm#5" target="lwr_lt">v.5</a>)- cp. <a href="mat10.htm#40">Mat 10:40-42</a>; <a href="mat25.htm#40">25:40</a>; <a href="joh13.htm#20">Joh 13:20</a>
<dt>whosoever shall offend {ie., cause to stumble} one of these... who believe in me... (<a href="mat18.htm#6" target="lwr_lt">v.6</a>)- 
<dd>It is evident that the 'children' in view here are the children of God, by new birth, through faith in Christ.
<dd>However, application can also be made to the right treatment of all human children. cp. <a href="mat19.htm#13">Mat 19:13-15</a>
<dd>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Lord will hold all, who abuse or mislead children, accountable.</dl><dt>
<b><i>18:7 Woe unto the world because of offences! </b></i>{GK=skandalon, stumbling blocks}<i><b><br>
for it must needs be that offences come;<br>
but woe to that man by whom the offence cometh! </b></i>{<a href="mat18.htm#6" target="lwr_lt">v.6</a>; <a href="luk17.htm#1">Luk 17:1,2</a>}<b><i><br>
18:8 Wherefore if thy hand or thy foot offend thee, </b></i>{GK=skandalizo, cause you (or another) to stumble}<b><i><br>
cut them off, and cast [them] from thee:<br>
it is better for thee to enter into life halt or maimed,<br>
rather than having two hands or two feet to be cast into everlasting fire.<br>
18:9 And if thine eye offend thee, pluck it out, and cast [it] from thee:<br>
it is better for thee to enter into life with one eye,<br>
rather than having two eyes to be cast into hell fire.<br>
18:10 Take heed that ye despise not one of these little ones; for I say unto you,<br>
That in heaven their angels do always behold the face of my Father which is in heaven.</i></b></dt><dl>
<dt>cut it off...- The same radical surgery, previously prescribed to deal with personal sin,
<dd>is here prescribed against causing others to falter from following the Lord. (see the <a href="mat5an.htm#27" target="lwr_lt">Notes at Mat 5:27-30</a>)<br>
cp. <a href="rom14.htm#13">Rom 14:13-15</a>; <a href="1cor8.htm#13">1Cor 8:13</a>
<dt>their angels... behold...- 
<dd>If this verse teaches that every human child has a guardian angel, it is the only passage which does so.
<dd>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is unwise to build a doctrine on an isolated passage.
<dd>Because 'children,' in the context of this passage, refers primarily to the 'children of God' (<a href="mat18.htm#6" target="lwr_lt">v.6</a>), 
it is better to understand 'their angels' as referring to-<ol type="a">
<li>Angels who minister to the ''heirs of salvation.'' cp. <a href="psa91.htm#9">Psa 91:9-11</a>; <a href="heb1.htm#14">Heb 1:14</a> 
<li>The spirits of God's children who currently enjoy spiritual access into His presence.<br>
Note that the word 'angel' is used of a believer's spiritual essence in <a href="act12.htm#15">Acts 12:15</a>.<br>
Believers are already spiritually present in the heavenlies. <a href="eph1.htm#3">Eph 1:3</a>; <a href="eph2.htm#6">2:6</a>; <a href="heb10.htm#19">Heb 10:19-22</a>; <a href="heb12.htm#22">12:22,23</a>
<br>Having received the spirit of sonship (<a href="rom8.htm#14">Rom 8:14-17</a>; <a href="1joh3.htm#1">1Joh 3:1-3</a>), can any child of God covet something 'greater' in the Kingdom (<a href="mat18.htm#1" target="lwr_lt">v.1</a>) than the access before His Throne, which He has granted to all of His children?</ol>
In either case (a. or b. above), the interests of His precious children are well represented before the Father.<br>
God will deal severely with anyone who stumbles His child. <a href="mat18.htm#6" target="lwr_lt">v.6-9</a>; <a href="luk18.htm#7">Luk 18:7,8</a>; <a href="psa17.htm#13">Psa 17:13-15</a></dl><dt>
<b><i>18:11 For the Son of man is come to save that which was lost. </b></i>{<a href="1tim1.htm#15">1Tim 1:15</a>}<i><b><br>
18:12 How think ye? if a man have an hundred sheep, and one of them be gone astray,<br>
doth he not leave the ninety and nine, and goeth into the mountains,<br>
and seeketh that which is gone astray? </b></i>{<a href="isa53.htm#6">Isa 53:6</a>; <a href="luk19.htm#10">Luk 19:10</a>; <a href="joh10.htm#11">Joh 10:11</a>}<i><b><br>
18:13 And if so be that he find it, verily I say unto you,<br>
he rejoiceth more of that [sheep], than of the ninety and nine which went not astray. </b></i>{<a href="isa53.htm#11">Isa 53:11</a>}<i><b><br>
18:14 Even so it is not the will of your Father which is in heaven,<br>
that one of these little ones should perish.</i></b></dt><dl>
<dt>The parable of the Lost Sheep. cp. <a href="luk15.htm#3">Luk 15:3-7</a>
<dd>At the heart of God's purposes are His precious children...<ul>
<li>who, if not for His costly intervention, would have perished in sin. <a href="joh3.htm#16">Joh 3:16,17</a>; <a href="1tim1.htm#15">1Tim 1:15</a>; <a href="2pet3.htm#9">2Pet 3:9</a>
<li>who, inspite of the world's offences against them, He will preserve. <a href="joh10.htm#27">Joh 10:27-30</a>; <a href="1pet1.htm#5">1Pet 1:5</a></ul>
<dd>Thus, whoever would stumble a child of God (<a href="mat18.htm#10" target="lwr_lt">v.10</a>) is at cross purposes with God, &quot;for the Son came to save...&quot; (<a href="mat18.htm#11" target="lwr_lt">v.11</a>) and &quot;even so {ie., likewise}&quot; the Father wills to preserve His &quot;little ones&quot; (<a href="mat18.htm#14" target="lwr_lt">v.14</a>). (See also: <a href="jer50.htm#6">Jer 50:6</a>; <a href="eze34.htm#11">Eze 34:11-16</a>)</dl><dt>
<b><i>18:15 Moreover if thy brother shall trespass against thee,<br>
go and tell him his fault between thee and him alone:<br>
if he shall hear thee, thou hast gained thy brother.<br>
18:16 But if he will not hear [thee, then] take with thee one or two more,<br>
that in the mouth of two or three witnesses every word may be established. </b></i>{<a href="deu19.htm#15">Deu 19:15</a>}<i><b><br>
18:17 And if he shall neglect to hear them, tell [it] unto the church </b></i>{GK=ekklesia}<b><i>:<br>
but if he neglect to hear the church </b></i>{GK=ekklesia, assembly of called out ones}<b><i>,<br>
let him be unto thee as an heathen man and a publican.<br>
18:18 Verily I say unto you,<br>
Whatsoever ye shall bind on earth shall be bound in heaven:<br>
and whatsoever ye shall loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.</b></i></dt><dl>
<dt>if thy brother trespass {GK=hamartano, misses the mark, errs, does wrong} against thee...-
<dd>''Thy brother,'' in the context, is a fellow child of God. cp. <a href="1joh4.htm#20">1Joh 4:20,21</a>; <a href="1joh5.htm#1">5:1</a>
<dd>Here are the steps for conflict resolution and discipline within the Church:<ol type="1">
<li>go to him alone (v.15) - &quot;Tell him his fault.&quot; -<dd>This phrase is from one word {GK=elegcho, reprove, rebuke (him for this wrong)}.</dd><dd>ie., Confess and deal with the problem, one on one, believer to believer. <a href="jam5.htm#16">Jam 5:16</a></dd>
<li>go to him with a few other brothers (v.16)-<dd>Rehearse the issues before them. Seek, and submit to, their counsel.</dd>
<li>go to the assembled believers (v.17a)- Let the congregation decide the matter.<dd>
This is the highest court of appeal for matters between believers. cp. <a href="1cor5.htm#3">1Cor 5:3-5</a>; <a href="1cor6.htm#1">6:1-5</a></dd><dt>The Lord prescribed these steps to lead, if possible, to reconciliation.</dt></ol>
<dt>if he neglect to hear the church...(v.17b)- If the authority of the assembled believers is disregarded, 
<dd>the offending individual may be disassociated from the fellowship as a means of discipline.<br>
cp. <a href="1cor5.htm#9">1Cor 5:9-13</a>; <a href="2the3.htm#6">2The 3:6,14,15</a>
<dt>whatever ye shall bind on earth...- 
<dd>Recall that 'binding and loosing' relates to forgiveness of sin (<a href="joh20.htm#22">Joh 20:22,23</a>; and the <a href="mat16an.htm#19" target="lwr_lt">Notes at Mat 16:19</a>).
<dd>In the context of church discipline, the goal of disciplinary action is to restore the sinning brother to fellowship, by encouraging him to seek repentance and forgiveness from the Lord. cp. <a href="2cor2.htm#6">2Cor 2:6-11</a>; <a href="gal6.htm#1">Gal 6:1</a></dl><dt>
<i><b>18:19 Again I say unto you,<br>
That if two of you shall agree on earth as touching any thing that they shall ask,<br>
it shall be done for them of my Father which is in heaven.<br>
18:20 For where two or three are gathered together in my name,<br>
there am I in the midst of them.</i></b></dt><dl>
<dt>if two of you agree...- This is not a formula for forcing God to answer prayer as we desire.<dd><ul>
<li>The agreement is to be centered on the person of the Lord Jesus Christ (<a href="mat18.htm#20" target="lwr_lt">v.20</a>),<br>
and therefore, in harmony with the will of God. cp. <a href="joh15.htm#7">Joh 15:7,16</a>; <a href="1joh3.htm#22">1Joh 3:22</a>; <a href="1joh5.htm#14">1Joh 5:14-16</a><dd>
Examples of such prayer- <a href="act4.htm#23">Acts 4:23-31</a>; <a href="eph6.htm#18">Eph 6:18-20</a>; <a href="jam5.htm#14">Jam 5:14-18</a></dd>
<li>The agreement (in the context of this passage)<br>is in regard to the resolution of trespasses and faults between brothers,<dd>whether the matter is resolved through repentance and forgiveness, or through discipline for lack of repentance.</dd></ul></dl><dt>
<b><i>18:21 Then came Peter to him, and said,<br>
Lord, how oft shall my brother sin against me, and I forgive him? till seven times?<br>
18:22 Jesus saith unto him, I say not unto thee, Until seven times:<br>
but, Until seventy times seven.</i></b></dt><dl>
<dt>Jesus' answer implies that we should forgive without keeping count, without limit.
<dd>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cp. <a href="mat6.htm#14">Mat 6:14,15</a>; <a href="mar11.htm#25">Mark 11:25</a>; <a href="luk17.htm#3">Luk 17:3,4</a>; <a href="eph4.htm#31">Eph 4:31,32</a>; <a href="col3.htm#13">Col 3:13</a>
<dd>We are to forgive others in the same manner that God has forgiven us.<br>
Jesus powerfully illustrated this with the parable of the Unforgiving Servant (<a href="mat18.htm#23" target="lwr_lt">v.23-35</a>)...
</dl><dt>
<b><i>18:23 Therefore is the kingdom of heaven likened unto a certain king,<br>
which would take account of </b></i>{ie., make settlement with}<b><i> his servants.<br>
18:24 And when he had begun to reckon,<br>
one was brought unto him, which owed him ten thousand talents.</b></i></dt><dl>
<dt>ten thousand talents - ie., a debt far beyond his ability to pay in a lifetime.
<dd>The basic meaning of the word 'talent' is 'weight.' It can be applied to anything weighable. However, a talent of silver or gold was recognized as a specific weight approximating 100 pounds (eg., the golden lampstand in the Tabernacle was made 'of a talent of pure gold' <a href="ex25.htm#39">Ex 25:39</a>). In today's valuation, depending on whether the ten thousand talents were of silver or of gold, this debt would be equivalent to millions or billions of dollars.</dl><i><b><dt>
18:25 But forasmuch as he had not to pay,<br>
his lord commanded him to be sold, and his wife, and children, and all that he had,<br>
and payment to be made.<br>
18:26 The servant therefore fell down, and worshipped him, saying,<br>
Lord, have patience with me, and I will pay thee all.<br>
18:27 Then the lord of that servant was moved with compassion,<br>
and loosed him, and forgave him the debt.<br>
18:28 But the same servant went out,<br>
and found one of his fellowservants, which owed him an hundred pence:<br>
and he laid hands on him, and took [him] by the throat, saying, Pay me that thou owest.</b></i></dt><dl>
<dt>an hundred pence {GK=denarii, a small silver coin} - One denarius was a laborer's daily wage (see <a href="mat20.htm#2">20:2</a>).<dd>This was not an insignificant debt. Its repayment would be difficult, but not impossible, for a common laborer. In our day, it might compare to a debt of $10,000, for a minimum wage earner.</dl><dt><i><b>
18:29 And his fellowservant fell down at his feet, and besought him, saying,<br>
Have patience with me, and I will pay thee all.<br>
18:30 And he would not: but went and cast him into prison, till he should pay the debt.<br>
18:31 So when his fellowservants saw what was done,<br>
they were very sorry, and came and told unto their lord all that was done.<br>
18:32 Then his lord, after that he had called him, said unto him,<br>
O thou wicked servant, I forgave thee all that debt, because thou desiredst me:<br>
18:33 Shouldest not thou also have had compassion on thy fellowservant,<br>
even as I had pity on thee?<br>
18:34 And his lord was wroth,<br>
and delivered him to the tormentors, till he should pay all that was due unto him.<br>
18:35 So likewise shall my heavenly Father do also unto you,<br>
if ye from your hearts forgive not every one his brother their trespasses.</i></b> {cp. <a href="jam2.htm#13">Jam 2:13</a>}</dt><dl>
<dt>Should you not also have compassion on your fellowservant...?
<dd>When the principle of forgiveness by grace (<a href="mat18.htm#27" target="lwr_lt">v.27</a>) is rejected (<a href="mat18.htm#28" target="lwr_lt">v.28-30</a>), sin must be dealt with under the principle of the Law (<a href="mat18.htm#32" target="lwr_lt">v.32-34</a>).<br>
Just as, no man can pay the debt that he owes to God, but is entirely dependent upon forgiveness by grace (<a href="rom3.htm#19">Rom 3:19-26</a>; <a href="rom6.htm#23">6:23</a>; <a href="eph2.htm#8">Eph 2:8,9</a>), no man can afford to reject this principle in dealing with other believers (<a href="1cor6.htm#1">1Cor 6:1-11</a>; <a href="mat6.htm#14">Mat 6:14,15</a>; <a href="eph4.htm#31">Eph 4:31,32</a>).
