Genesis  12<br> 1. Now the LORD had said unto Abram, Get thee out of thy country, and from thy kindred, and from thy father's house, unto a land that I will shew thee:<br><a name="2">2</a>  And I will make of thee a great nation, and I will bless thee, and make thy name great; and thou shalt be a blessing:<br><a name="3">3</a>  And I will bless them that bless thee, and curse him that curseth thee: and in thee shall all families of the earth be blessed.<br><a name="4">4</a>. So Abram departed, as the LORD had spoken unto him; and Lot went with him: and Abram [was] seventy and five years old when he departed out of Haran.<br><a name="5">5</a>  And Abram took Sarai his wife, and Lot his brother's son, and all their substance that they had gathered, and the souls that they had gotten in Haran; and they went forth to go into the land of Canaan; and into the land of Canaan they came.<br><a name="6">6</a>. And Abram passed through the land unto the place of Sichem, unto the plain of Moreh. And the Canaanite [was] then in the land.<br><a name="7">7</a>  And the LORD appeared unto Abram, and said, Unto thy seed will I give this land: and there builded he an altar unto the LORD, who appeared unto him.<br><a name="8">8</a>  And he removed from thence unto a mountain on the east of Bethel, and pitched his tent, [having] Bethel on the west, and Hai on the east: and there he builded an altar unto the LORD, and called upon the name of the LORD.<br><a name="9">9</a>  And Abram journeyed, going on still toward the south.<br><a name="10">10</a>. And there was a famine in the land: and Abram went down into Egypt to sojourn there; for the famine [was] grievous in the land.<br><a name="11">11</a>  And it came to pass, when he was come near to enter into Egypt, that he said unto Sarai his wife, Behold now, I know that thou [art] a fair woman to look upon:<br><a name="12">12</a>  Therefore it shall come to pass, when the Egyptians shall see thee, that they shall say, This [is] his wife: and they will kill me, but they will save thee alive.<br><a name="13">13</a>  Say, I pray thee, thou [art] my sister: that it may be well with me for thy sake; and my soul shall live because of thee.<br><a name="14">14</a>. And it came to pass, that, when Abram was come into Egypt, the Egyptians beheld the woman that she [was] very fair.<br><a name="15">15</a>  The princes also of Pharaoh saw her, and commended her before Pharaoh: and the woman was taken into Pharaoh's house.<br><a name="16">16</a>  And he entreated Abram well for her sake: and he had sheep, and oxen, and he asses, and menservants, and maidservants, and she asses, and camels.<br><a name="17">17</a>  And the LORD plagued Pharaoh and his house with great plagues because of Sarai Abram's wife.<br><a name="18">18</a>  And Pharaoh called Abram, and said, What [is] this [that] thou hast done unto me? why didst thou not tell me that she [was] thy wife?<br><a name="19">19</a>  Why saidst thou, She [is] my sister? so I might have taken her to me to wife: now therefore behold thy wife, take [her], and go thy way.<br><a name="20">20</a>  And Pharaoh commanded [his] men concerning him: and they sent him away, and his wife, and all that he had.<br><br>Go to <a href="gen13.htm#1">Genesis 13</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
