Isaiah  24<br>1. Behold, the LORD maketh the earth empty, and maketh it waste, and turneth it upside down, and scattereth abroad the inhabitants thereof.<br><a name="2">2</a>  And it shall be, as with the people, so with the priest; as with the servant, so with his master; as with the maid, so with her mistress; as with the buyer, so with the seller; as with the lender, so with the borrower; as with the taker of usury, so with the giver of usury to him.<br><a name="3">3</a>  The land shall be utterly emptied, and utterly spoiled: for the LORD hath spoken this word.<br><a name="4">4</a>  The earth mourneth [and] fadeth away, the world languisheth [and] fadeth away, the haughty people of the earth do languish.<br><a name="5">5</a>  The earth also is defiled under the inhabitants thereof; because they have transgressed the laws, changed the ordinance, broken the everlasting covenant.<br><a name="6">6</a>  Therefore hath the curse devoured the earth, and they that dwell therein are desolate: therefore the inhabitants of the earth are burned, and few men left.<br><a name="7">7</a>  The new wine mourneth, the vine languisheth, all the merryhearted do sigh.<br><a name="8">8</a>  The mirth of tabrets ceaseth, the noise of them that rejoice endeth, the joy of the harp ceaseth.<br><a name="9">9</a>  They shall not drink wine with a song; strong drink shall be bitter to them that drink it.<br><a name="10">10</a>  The city of confusion is broken down: every house is shut up, that no man may come in.<br><a name="11">11</a>  [There is] a crying for wine in the streets; all joy is darkened, the mirth of the land is gone.<br><a name="12">12</a>  In the city is left desolation, and the gate is smitten with destruction.<br><a name="13">13</a>. When thus it shall be in the midst of the land among the people, [there shall be] as the shaking of an olive tree, [and] as the gleaning grapes when the vintage is done.<br><a name="14">14</a>  They shall lift up their voice, they shall sing for the majesty of the LORD, they shall cry aloud from the sea.<br><a name="15">15</a>  Wherefore glorify ye the LORD in the fires, [even] the name of the LORD God of Israel in the isles of the sea.<br><a name="16">16</a>. From the uttermost part of the earth have we heard songs, [even] glory to the righteous. But I said, My leanness, my leanness, woe unto me! the treacherous dealers have dealt treacherously; yea, the treacherous dealers have dealt very treacherously.<br><a name="17">17</a>  Fear, and the pit, and the snare, [are] upon thee, O inhabitant of the earth.<br><a name="18">18</a>  And it shall come to pass, [that] he who fleeth from the noise of the fear shall fall into the pit; and he that cometh up out of the midst of the pit shall be taken in the snare: for the windows from on high are open, and the foundations of the earth do shake.<br><a name="19">19</a>  The earth is utterly broken down, the earth is clean dissolved, the earth is moved exceedingly.<br><a name="20">20</a>  The earth shall reel to and fro like a drunkard, and shall be removed like a cottage; and the transgression thereof shall be heavy upon it; and it shall fall, and not rise again.<br><a name="21">21</a>  And it shall come to pass in that day, [that] the LORD shall punish the host of the high ones [that are] on high, and the kings of the earth upon the earth.<br><a name="22">22</a>  And they shall be gathered together, [as] prisoners are gathered in the pit, and shall be shut up in the prison, and after many days shall they be visited.<br><a name="23">23</a>  Then the moon shall be confounded, and the sun ashamed, when the LORD of hosts shall reign in mount Zion, and in Jerusalem, and before his ancients gloriously.<br><br>Go to <a href="isa25.htm#1">Isaiah 25</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
