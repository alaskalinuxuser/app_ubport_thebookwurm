Romans   2<br> 1. Therefore thou art inexcusable, O man, whosoever thou art that judgest: for wherein thou judgest another, thou condemnest thyself; for thou that judgest doest the same things.<br><a name="2">2</a>  But we are sure that the judgment of God is according to truth against them which commit such things.<br><a name="3">3</a>  And thinkest thou this, O man, that judgest them which do such things, and doest the same, that thou shalt escape the judgment of God?<br><a name="4">4</a>  Or despisest thou the riches of his goodness and forbearance and longsuffering; not knowing that the goodness of God leadeth thee to repentance?<br><a name="5">5</a>  But after thy hardness and impenitent heart treasurest up unto thyself wrath against the day of wrath and revelation of the righteous judgment of God;<br><a name="6">6</a>  Who will render to every man according to his deeds:<br><a name="7">7</a>  To them who by patient continuance in well doing seek for glory and honour and immortality, eternal life:<br><a name="8">8</a>  But unto them that are contentious, and do not obey the truth, but obey unrighteousness, indignation and wrath,<br><a name="9">9</a>  Tribulation and anguish, upon every soul of man that doeth evil, of the Jew first, and also of the Gentile;<br><a name="10">10</a>  But glory, honour, and peace, to every man that worketh good, to the Jew first, and also to the Gentile:<br><a name="11">11</a>  For there is no respect of persons with God.<br><a name="12">12</a>  For as many as have sinned without law shall also perish without law: and as many as have sinned in the law shall be judged by the law;<br><a name="13">13</a>  (For not the hearers of the law [are] just before God, but the doers of the law shall be justified.<br><a name="14">14</a>  For when the Gentiles, which have not the law, do by nature the things contained in the law, these, having not the law, are a law unto themselves:<br><a name="15">15</a>  Which shew the work of the law written in their hearts, their conscience also bearing witness, and [their] thoughts the mean while accusing or else excusing one another;)<br><a name="16">16</a>  In the day when God shall judge the secrets of men by Jesus Christ according to my gospel.<br><a name="17">17</a>. Behold, thou art called a Jew, and restest in the law, and makest thy boast of God,<br><a name="18">18</a>  And knowest [his] will, and approvest the things that are more excellent, being instructed out of the law;<br><a name="19">19</a>  And art confident that thou thyself art a guide of the blind, a light of them which are in darkness,<br><a name="20">20</a>  An instructor of the foolish, a teacher of babes, which hast the form of knowledge and of the truth in the law.<br><a name="21">21</a>  Thou therefore which teachest another, teachest thou not thyself? thou that preachest a man should not steal, dost thou steal?<br><a name="22">22</a>  Thou that sayest a man should not commit adultery, dost thou commit adultery? thou that abhorrest idols, dost thou commit sacrilege?<br><a name="23">23</a>  Thou that makest thy boast of the law, through breaking the law dishonourest thou God?<br><a name="24">24</a>  For the name of God is blasphemed among the Gentiles through you, as it is written.<br><a name="25">25</a>  For circumcision verily profiteth, if thou keep the law: but if thou be a breaker of the law, thy circumcision is made uncircumcision.<br><a name="26">26</a>  Therefore if the uncircumcision keep the righteousness of the law, shall not his uncircumcision be counted for circumcision?<br><a name="27">27</a>  And shall not uncircumcision which is by nature, if it fulfil the law, judge thee, who by the letter and circumcision dost transgress the law?<br><a name="28">28</a>  For he is not a Jew, which is one outwardly; neither [is that] circumcision, which is outward in the flesh:<br><a name="29">29</a>  But he [is] a Jew, which is one inwardly; and circumcision [is that] of the heart, in the spirit, [and] not in the letter; whose praise [is] not of men, but of God.<br><br>Go to <a href="rom3.htm#1">Romans 3</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
