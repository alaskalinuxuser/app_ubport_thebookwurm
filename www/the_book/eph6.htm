Ephesians   6<br> 1. Children, obey your parents in the Lord: for this is right.<br><a name="2">2</a>  Honour thy father and mother; (which is the first commandment with promise;)<br><a name="3">3</a>  That it may be well with thee, and thou mayest live long on the earth.<br><a name="4">4</a>  And, ye fathers, provoke not your children to wrath: but bring them up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord.<br><a name="5">5</a>  Servants, be obedient to them that are [your] masters according to the flesh, with fear and trembling, in singleness of your heart, as unto Christ;<br><a name="6">6</a>  Not with eyeservice, as menpleasers; but as the servants of Christ, doing the will of God from the heart;<br><a name="7">7</a>  With good will doing service, as to the Lord, and not to men:<br><a name="8">8</a>  Knowing that whatsoever good thing any man doeth, the same shall he receive of the Lord, whether [he be] bond or free.<br><a name="9">9</a>  And, ye masters, do the same things unto them, forbearing threatening: knowing that your Master also is in heaven; neither is there respect of persons with him.<br><a name="10">10</a>. Finally, my brethren, be strong in the Lord, and in the power of his might.<br><a name="11">11</a>  Put on the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil.<br><a name="12">12</a>  For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high [places].<br><a name="13">13</a>  Wherefore take unto you the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to withstand in the evil day, and having done all, to stand.<br><a name="14">14</a>  Stand therefore, having your loins girt about with truth, and having on the breastplate of righteousness;<br><a name="15">15</a>  And your feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace;<br><a name="16">16</a>  Above all, taking the shield of faith, wherewith ye shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked.<br><a name="17">17</a>  And take the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God:<br><a name="18">18</a>  Praying always with all prayer and supplication in the Spirit, and watching thereunto with all perseverance and supplication for all saints;<br><a name="19">19</a>. And for me, that utterance may be given unto me, that I may open my mouth boldly, to make known the mystery of the gospel,<br><a name="20">20</a>  For which I am an ambassador in bonds: that therein I may speak boldly, as I ought to speak.<br><a name="21">21</a>  But that ye also may know my affairs, [and] how I do, Tychicus, a beloved brother and faithful minister in the Lord, shall make known to you all things:<br><a name="22">22</a>  Whom I have sent unto you for the same purpose, that ye might know our affairs, and [that] he might comfort your hearts.<br><a name="23">23</a>  Peace [be] to the brethren, and love with faith, from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.<br><a name="24">24</a>  Grace [be] with all them that love our Lord Jesus Christ in sincerity.
