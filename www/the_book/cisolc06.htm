by C.I. Scofield
<h2>Law and Grace</h2></center>
<p>The believer is not under the Law, but instead under grace.</p>
<b><ol type="A">
<li>Law</b><ol type="1">
<li>What is the Law?<br>The Law, given by God to the children of Israel, regulated almost every aspect of life in Old Testament times. It was while on Mount Sinai that Moses was given the Ten Commandments.<ul>
<li><a href="deu4.htm#40">Deuteronomy 4:40</a> - &quot;Thou shalt keep therefore His statutes, and His commandments &quot; (see <a href="ex34.htm#1">Exodus 34</a>)
<li><a href="rom7.htm#12">Romans 7:12</a> - &quot;The law is holy&quot;
<li><a href="psa19.htm#7">Psalm 19:7,8</a> - &quot;The law of the Lord is perfect... sure... right... pure&quot;</ul>
<li>What does the Law do?<ul>
<li><a href="gal3.htm#10">Galatians 3:10</a> - &quot;Under the curse&quot;
<li><a href="jam2.htm#10">James 2:10</a> - &quot;Whosoever shall keep the whole law, and yet offend in one point, he is guilty of all&quot;
<li><a href="rom3.htm#19">Romans 3:19</a> - &quot;Every mouth may be stopped, and all... guilty before God&quot;<br>D.L.Moody once said that the law is like a mirror -- useful to convince one that his face is dirty, but a poor thing to wash it with.</ul>
<li>What can't the Law do?<ul>
<li><a href="rom3.htm#20">Romans 3:20</a> - &quot;By the deeds of the law there shall no flesh be justified&quot;
<li><a href="act13.htm#39">Acts 13:39</a> - &quot;You could not be justified by the law of Moses&quot;
<li><a href="heb7.htm#18">Hebrews 7:18,19</a> - &quot;The law made nothing perfect&quot;</ul>
<li>Why was the Law given?<ul>
<li><a href="gal3.htm#19">Galatians 3:19</a> - &quot;It was added because of transgressions&quot;
<li><a href="gal3.htm#23">Galatians 3:23-25</a> - &quot;The law was our schoolmaster to bring us unto Christ... after that faith is come, we are no longer under a schoolmaster&quot;</ul>
<li>What is the believer's rule of life?<ul>
<li><a href="1joh2.htm#6">1John 2:6</a> - &quot;To walk, even as He walked&quot;
<li><a href="1joh2.htm#28">1John 2:28</a> - &quot;Abide in Him&quot;
<li><a href="php2.htm#5">Philippians 2:5-8</a> - &quot;Let this mind be in you.&quot; Believers are to have the mind of Christ.</ul></ol><b>
<li>Grace</b><ol type="1">
<li>What is grace?<br>Grace is the freely-given, unmerited favor and love of God.<ul>
<li><a href="eph2.htm#7">Ephesians 2:7</a> - &quot;His kindness toward us through Christ Jesus&quot;
<li><a href="tit3.htm#4">Titus 3:4,5</a> - &quot;Kindness and love of God our Saviour toward man&quot;
<li><a href="eph2.htm#4">Ephesians 2:4,5</a> - &quot;His great love wherewith He loved us&quot;</ul>
<li>What does grace do?<ul>
<li><a href="eph2.htm#8">Ephesians 2:8</a> - &quot;By grace are ye saved&quot;
<li><a href="tit2.htm#11">Titus 2:11-13</a> - &quot;The grace of God that bringeth salvation&quot;
<li><a href="rom3.htm#24">Romans 3:24,25</a> - &quot;Justified freely by His grace through... redemption&quot;</ul>
<li>Is Christianity a mixed system of law and grace?<ul>
<li><a href="rom4.htm#4">Romans 4:4</a> - &quot;To him that worketh is the reward not reckoned of grace&quot;
<li><a href="rom4.htm#5">Romans 4:5</a> - &quot;To him that worketh not, but believeth... his faith is counted for righteousness&quot;
<li><a href="gal5.htm#4">Galatians 5:4</a> - &quot;Whosever of you are justisfied by the law; ye are fallen from grace&quot;</ul>
Compare <a href="deu21.htm#18">Deuteronomy 21:18-21</a> with <a href="luk15.htm#18">Luke 15:18-23</a> to see a beautiful contrast between law and grace.</ol></ol>
