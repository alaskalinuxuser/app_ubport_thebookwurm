<dt><b>Introduction </b>(from the editor at TheBookWurm.com)--
<dd>With the permission of the original publisher, we have integrated Paul Van Gorder's book with <i>'The Book'</i> to provide overview '<a href="sktchot.htm#_top">sketches</a>' of each Old Testament book. In doing so, we have reformatted the author's text into HTML, adding active links to all scripture references. While we have not edited the original textual content in any way, we have occasionally made corrections to typographical errors in the original (eg., spelling, misdesignated scripture references, etc.). In some places, we have added scripture references, and/or explanatory notes to support the author's discussion. All such editorial changes from the original are shown in brackets [like this].<br>
<dt><b>Preface </b>(from the author)--
<dd>With no claim for originality, I have endeavored to peruse the pages of the Old Testament and see there the glorious person and redemptive work of Jesus Christ.<br><br>
What warrant, you may ask, do I have for attempting to find Him in the pages of the Old Testament? I do so in the light of our Lord's own declaration, ''Search the scriptures; for in them ye think ye have eternal life; and they are they which testify of Me'' (<a href="joh5.htm#39">John 5:39</a>). We heed the example He set when He talked with those disciples walking toward Emmaus: ''And beginning at Moses and all the prophets, He expounded unto them, in all the scriptures, the things concerning Himself'' (<a href="luk24.htm#27">Luke 24:27</a>).<br><br>
Adolph Saphir wrote: ''All attempts to understand Jesus Christ, separate from the Old Testament, are most unphilosophical, and can produce no satisfactory result. For Jesus Christ is the fulfillment of Moses and the prophets.''<br><br>
In the course of these studies I will suggest the main themes of each book, outlines of truth, and summaries of content. My intent is that you not only read these chapters, but that you study them along with your Bible. This will solidly establish the truth of our Lord's person and work in your heart and life.<br><br>On the last pages of this book, there is space to write down the pictures of Christ you find in the Old Testament that I have not included. I pray that this volume will serve as a workbook, providing springboards for further study and growth.<ul><li>Paul R. Van Gorder</ul>
