Jeremiah   9<br>1. Oh that my head were waters, and mine eyes a fountain of tears, that I might weep day and night for the slain of the daughter of my people!<br><a name="2">2</a>  Oh that I had in the wilderness a lodging place of wayfaring men; that I might leave my people, and go from them! for they [be] all adulterers, an assembly of treacherous men.<br><a name="3">3</a>  And they bend their tongues [like] their bow [for] lies: but they are not valiant for the truth upon the earth; for they proceed from evil to evil, and they know not me, saith the LORD.<br><a name="4">4</a>  Take ye heed every one of his neighbour, and trust ye not in any brother: for every brother will utterly supplant, and every neighbour will walk with slanders.<br><a name="5">5</a>  And they will deceive every one his neighbour, and will not speak the truth: they have taught their tongue to speak lies, [and] weary themselves to commit iniquity.<br><a name="6">6</a>  Thine habitation [is] in the midst of deceit; through deceit they refuse to know me, saith the LORD.<br><a name="7">7</a>  Therefore thus saith the LORD of hosts, Behold, I will melt them, and try them; for how shall I do for the daughter of my people?<br><a name="8">8</a>  Their tongue [is as] an arrow shot out; it speaketh deceit: [one] speaketh peaceably to his neighbour with his mouth, but in heart he layeth his wait.<br><a name="9">9</a>  Shall I not visit them for these [things]? saith the LORD: shall not my soul be avenged on such a nation as this?<br><a name="10">10</a>  For the mountains will I take up a weeping and wailing, and for the habitations of the wilderness a lamentation, because they are burned up, so that none can pass through [them]; neither can [men] hear the voice of the cattle; both the fowl of the heavens and the beast are fled; they are gone.<br><a name="11">11</a>  And I will make Jerusalem heaps, [and] a den of dragons; and I will make the cities of Judah desolate, without an inhabitant.<br><a name="12">12</a>. Who [is] the wise man, that may understand this? and [who is he] to whom the mouth of the LORD hath spoken, that he may declare it, for what the land perisheth [and] is burned up like a wilderness, that none passeth through?<br><a name="13">13</a>  And the LORD saith, Because they have forsaken my law which I set before them, and have not obeyed my voice, neither walked therein;<br><a name="14">14</a>  But have walked after the imagination of their own heart, and after Baalim, which their fathers taught them:<br><a name="15">15</a>  Therefore thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Behold, I will feed them, [even] this people, with wormwood, and give them water of gall to drink.<br><a name="16">16</a>  I will scatter them also among the heathen, whom neither they nor their fathers have known: and I will send a sword after them, till I have consumed them.<br><a name="17">17</a>  Thus saith the LORD of hosts, Consider ye, and call for the mourning women, that they may come; and send for cunning [women], that they may come:<br><a name="18">18</a>  And let them make haste, and take up a wailing for us, that our eyes may run down with tears, and our eyelids gush out with waters.<br><a name="19">19</a>  For a voice of wailing is heard out of Zion, How are we spoiled! we are greatly confounded, because we have forsaken the land, because our dwellings have cast [us] out.<br><a name="20">20</a>  Yet hear the word of the LORD, O ye women, and let your ear receive the word of his mouth, and teach your daughters wailing, and every one her neighbour lamentation.<br><a name="21">21</a>  For death is come up into our windows, [and] is entered into our palaces, to cut off the children from without, [and] the young men from the streets.<br><a name="22">22</a>  Speak, Thus saith the LORD, Even the carcases of men shall fall as dung upon the open field, and as the handful after the harvestman, and none shall gather [them].<br><a name="23">23</a>. Thus saith the LORD, Let not the wise [man] glory in his wisdom, neither let the mighty [man] glory in his might, let not the rich [man] glory in his riches:<br><a name="24">24</a>  But let him that glorieth glory in this, that he understandeth and knoweth me, that I [am] the LORD which exercise lovingkindness, judgment, and righteousness, in the earth: for in these [things] I delight, saith the LORD.<br><a name="25">25</a>  Behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will punish all [them which are] circumcised with the uncircumcised;<br><a name="26">26</a>  Egypt, and Judah, and Edom, and the children of Ammon, and Moab, and all [that are] in the utmost corners, that dwell in the wilderness: for all [these] nations [are] uncircumcised, and all the house of Israel [are] uncircumcised in the heart.<br><br>Go to <a href="jer10.htm#1">Jeremiah 10</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
