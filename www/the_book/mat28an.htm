<b><i>28:1 In the end of the sabbath, as it began to dawn toward the first [day] of the week, <br>
came Mary Magdalene and the other Mary to see the sepulchre.<br>
28:2 And, behold, there was a great earthquake: <br>
for the angel of the Lord descended from heaven, <br>
and came and rolled back the stone from the door, and sat upon it.<br>
28:3 His countenance was like lightning, and his raiment white as snow:<br>
28:4 And for fear of him the keepers did shake, and became as dead [men].</i></b></dt><dl>
<dt>A composite of the four gospel accounts provides the full record of Christ's Resurrection.<ul>
<li>For the <i>order of events</i> on the resurrection morning, see the <a href="joh20an.htm#1" target="lwr_lt">Notes at John 20:1</a>.
<li>For the <i>order of appearances</i> of the resurrected Christ, see the note following v.8 below.</ul>
<dt>Because Matthew is writing to the Jews, about their King and His Kingdom,
<dd>his account emphasizes the power and overwhelming victory of the King.-<ul>
<li>earthquakes accompanied...-<ol type="a">
<li>the giving of the Law, at Mt. Sinai. <a href="ex19.htm#18">Ex 19:18</a>; <a href="ex20.htm#18">20:18-20</a><dd>- The power of sin demonstrated (by the Law). <a href="1cor15.htm#55">1Cor 15:55-57</a></dd>
<li>the rending of the veil, at Christ's death. <a href="mat27.htm#51">Mat 27:51</a> - The power of sin destroyed.
<li>the opening of the tomb, at Christ's resurrection. <a href="mat28.htm#2" target="lwr_lt">v.2</a> - The power of death defeated.</ol>
<li>enemies are shaken and powerless before His representatives. (<a href="mat28.htm#4" target="lwr_lt">v.4</a>)
<li>angels announced...- <ol type="a">
<li>the Law. cp. <a href="psa68.htm#17">Psa 68:17</a>; <a href="act7.htm#51">Acts 7:51-53</a>; <a href="gal3.htm#19">Gal 3:19</a>; <a href="heb2.htm#2">Heb 2:2,3</a>

<b><i>28:5 And the angel answered and said unto the women, <br>
Fear not ye: for I know that ye seek Jesus, which was crucified.<br>
28:6 He is not here: for he is risen, as he said. <br>
Come, see the place where the Lord lay.<br>
28:7 And go quickly, and tell his disciples that he is risen from the dead; <br>
and, behold, he goeth before you into Galilee; there shall ye see him: lo, I have told you.</i></b></dt><dl>
<dt>fear not... for he is risen... - Christianity is unique.
<dd>The founders of all other religions are in their graves. Only Christ is risen.<ol type="A">
<li>The Christian faith rests on the facts of the bodily Death and Resurrection of Christ. <a href="1cor15.htm#1">1Cor 15:1-4</a>
<li>The resurrection of Christ was attested by many eyewitnesses. <a href="mat28.htm#6" target="lwr_lt">v.6</a>; <a href="1cor15.htm#5">1Cor 15:5-8</a>
<li>The resurrection is essential to the Christian message. cp. <a href="mat28.htm#7" target="lwr_lt">v.7</a>; <a href="rom10.htm#9">Rom 10:9</a> -<ol type="a">
<li>If Christ did not rise from the dead, our faith would be in vain {ie., empty, devoid of truth}...<ul>
<li>we would be guilty of proclaiming a lie. <a href="1cor15.htm#14">1Cor 15:14-16</a>
<li>we would be yet in our sins, unforgiven, awaiting judgment. <a href="1cor15.htm#17">1Cor 15:17</a>
<li>we would have no hope beyond the grave. <a href="1cor15.htm#18">1Cor 15:18,19</a></ul>
<li>Because Christ is risen from the dead...<ul>
<li>we have a share in the present and future victories of our King, over sin and death. <a href="1cor15.htm#20">1Cor 15:20-28</a>
<li>we are motivated to serve Him, despite the costliness of being identified with Him, in a wicked world. <a href="1cor15.htm#29">1Cor 15:29-34</a>
<li>we confidently expect that we will inherit the Kingdom of God, which flesh cannot inherit. <a href="1cor15.htm#35">1Cor 15:35-53</a>
<li>we thank God, for the victory we have through our Lord Jesus Christ. <a href="1cor15.htm#54">1Cor 15:54-58</a></ul></ol></ol>
<dt>he is not here... Come see the place...- The stone was not moved to let Jesus out of the grave,
<dd>but to let the women and the disciples in, to view the evidence. <br>
His resurrected body rose up through the grave clothes and through the grave's stone walls. <br>
See the <a href="joh20an.htm#6" target="lwr_lt">Notes at John 20:6-8</a>; cp. <a href="joh20.htm#19">Joh 20:19</a>; <a href="1cor15.htm#42">1Cor 15:42-44</a>
<dt>go... and tell... - The proclamation of the resurrection of Jesus Christ 
<dd>has not been entrusted to angels, but to human believers. cp. <a href="mat28.htm#19" target="lwr_lt">v.19,20</a>

<b><i>28:8 And they departed quickly from the sepulchre with fear and great joy; <br>
and did run to bring his disciples word.<br>
28:9 And as they went to tell his disciples, behold, Jesus met them, saying, All hail. <br>
And they came and held him by the feet, and worshipped him.<br>
28:10 Then said Jesus unto them, Be not afraid: <br>
go tell my brethren that they go into Galilee, and there shall they see me.</i></b></dt><dl>

<b><i>28:11 Now when they were going, behold, some of the watch came into the city, <br>
and shewed unto the chief priests all the things that were done.<br>

they gave large money unto the soldiers,<br>
28:13 Saying, Say ye, His disciples came by night, and stole him [away] while we slept.<br>
28:14 And if this come to the governor's ears, we will persuade him, and secure you.<br>
28:15 So they took the money, and did as they were taught: <br>

<dt>the watch {<a href="mat27.htm#65">Mat 27:65,66</a>} - reported what they had seen (<a href="mat28.htm#2" target="lwr_lt">v.2-4</a>) to the Jewish authorities.
<dt>the chief priests and elders...<ol type="a"> 
<li>took counsel - They thought their problems were ended when they did away with Jesus (<a href="mat26.htm#3">Mat 26:3,4</a>; <a href="mat27.htm#1">27:1,2</a>).<dd>But they had only begun. cp. <a href="act4.htm#1">Acts 4:1-17</a></dd>
<li>bribed the soldiers with ''large'' {GK=hikanos, enough, sufficient} money.-<dd>ie., The soldiers named their own price. They must have been paid well.</dd><dd>Because, for a Roman soldier, the penalty for sleep while on duty was death. cp. <a href="act12.htm#18">Acts 12:18,19</a></dd>
<li>promised to protect them, if Pilate were to hear their false story.</ol></dl><dt>
<b><i>28:16 Then the eleven disciples went away into Galilee, <br>
into a mountain where Jesus had appointed them.<br>
28:17 And when they saw him, they worshipped him: but some doubted.<br>

<dt>...some doubted (<a href="mat28.htm#16" target="lwr_lt">v.16,17</a>)-  eg., Thomas, <a href="joh20.htm#24">Joh 20:24-29</a>
<dd>During His post-resurrection ministry, Christ dealt with their doubts.
<dd>If they were to be His witnesses, they had to be sure of His resurrection. One strong evidence for the historicity of Christ's resurrection is that the early disciples proclaimed it boldly, often at the cost of their own lives. cp. <a href="act20.htm#24">Acts 20:24</a>; <a href="php1.htm#20">Php 1:20,21</a>; <a href="1pet1.htm#3">1Pet 1:3-9</a>

<li>All authority is given unto me... -This statement conveys...<ol type="a">
<li>the basis for the commission (and of our responsibility to obey).
<li>the substance of the message regarding His Person and Work.
<li>the provision for the task.</ol>
<li>Go ye, therefore...- 
<li>and teach {GK=matheteuo, instruct, make disciples} --<ol type="a">
<li>baptizing... {GK=baptizo, wash, immerse} -<ul>
<li>with emphasis, not on the symbolic act, but on the spiritual reality -<dd>Water baptism (especially by immersion) is an illustration of, and a visible testimony to, God's work of regeneration, and the believer's identification and union with Christ. The physical act, of baptism, has no power to save, but is an outward expression of inward faith in Christ. (Note the order of  <a href="act18.htm#8">Acts 18:8</a>, 'hearing... believed... baptized.' cp. <a href="act2.htm#41">Acts 2:41</a>; <a href="act8.htm#35">8:35-38</a>). Such faith (which involves repentence of sin and identification with Christ) results in remission of sins and the reception of the Holy Spirit (<a href="act2.htm#38">Acts 2:38</a>).</dd><dd>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By faith, the believer is spiritually immersed into Christ (<a href="gal3.htm#26">Gal 3:26,27</a>; <a href="1cor12.htm#13">1Cor 12:13</a>), and because of this union, has become dead to sin and alive toward God (<a href="rom6.htm#3">Rom 6:3-5</a>; <a href="col2.htm#11">Col 2:11,12</a>; <a href="1pet3.htm#21">1Pet 3:21</a>).</dd><dd>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;See also the <a href="mat3an.htm#11" target="lwr_lt">Notes at Mat 3:11</a>. cp. <a href="act19.htm#3">Acts 19:3-5</a></dd>
<li>in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit -<ul>
<li>The word 'name' is singular.<dd>These three Persons are one in character and essence as God.</dd>
<li>Those who are identified with Christ (by trusting in Him for salvation) are also identified with the Father and the Holy Spirit.<dd>cp. <a href="act2.htm#38">Acts 2:38,39</a>; <a href="rom8.htm#8">Rom 8:8-17</a>; <a href="2cor13.htm#14">2Cor 13:14</a>; <a href="eph2.htm#18">Eph 2:18</a>
