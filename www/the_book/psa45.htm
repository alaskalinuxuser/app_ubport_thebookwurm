Psalms  45<br> 1. To the chief Musician upon Shoshannim, for the sons of Korah, Maschil, A Song of loves. My heart is inditing a good matter: I speak of the things which I have made touching the king: my tongue [is] the pen of a ready writer.<br><a name="2">2</a>  Thou art fairer than the children of men: grace is poured into thy lips: therefore God hath blessed thee for ever.<br><a name="3">3</a>  Gird thy sword upon [thy] thigh, O [most] mighty, with thy glory and thy majesty.<br><a name="4">4</a>  And in thy majesty ride prosperously because of truth and meekness [and] righteousness; and thy right hand shall teach thee terrible things.<br><a name="5">5</a>  Thine arrows [are] sharp in the heart of the king's enemies; [whereby] the people fall under thee.<br><a name="6">6</a>. Thy throne, O God, [is] for ever and ever: the sceptre of thy kingdom [is] a right sceptre.<br><a name="7">7</a>  Thou lovest righteousness, and hatest wickedness: therefore God, thy God, hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows.<br><a name="8">8</a>  All thy garments [smell] of myrrh, and aloes, [and] cassia, out of the ivory palaces, whereby they have made thee glad.<br><a name="9">9</a>  Kings' daughters [were] among thy honourable women: upon thy right hand did stand the queen in gold of Ophir.<br><a name="10">10</a>. Hearken, O daughter, and consider, and incline thine ear; forget also thine own people, and thy father's house;<br><a name="11">11</a>  So shall the king greatly desire thy beauty: for he [is] thy Lord; and worship thou him.<br><a name="12">12</a>  And the daughter of Tyre [shall be there] with a gift; [even] the rich among the people shall intreat thy favour.<br><a name="13">13</a>  The king's daughter [is] all glorious within: her clothing [is] of wrought gold.<br><a name="14">14</a>  She shall be brought unto the king in raiment of needlework: the virgins her companions that follow her shall be brought unto thee.<br><a name="15">15</a>  With gladness and rejoicing shall they be brought: they shall enter into the king's palace.<br><a name="16">16</a>  Instead of thy fathers shall be thy children, whom thou mayest make princes in all the earth.<br><a name="17">17</a>  I will make thy name to be remembered in all generations: therefore shall the people praise thee for ever and ever.<br><br>Go to <a href="psa46.htm#1">Psalm 46</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
