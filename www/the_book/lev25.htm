Leviticus  25<br>1. And the LORD spake unto Moses in mount Sinai, saying,<br><a name="2">2</a>  Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye come into the land which I give you, then shall the land keep a sabbath unto the LORD.<br><a name="3">3</a>  Six years thou shalt sow thy field, and six years thou shalt prune thy vineyard, and gather in the fruit thereof;<br><a name="4">4</a>  But in the seventh year shall be a sabbath of rest unto the land, a sabbath for the LORD: thou shalt neither sow thy field, nor prune thy vineyard.<br><a name="5">5</a>  That which groweth of its own accord of thy harvest thou shalt not reap, neither gather the grapes of thy vine undressed: [for] it is a year of rest unto the land.<br><a name="6">6</a>  And the sabbath of the land shall be meat for you; for thee, and for thy servant, and for thy maid, and for thy hired servant, and for thy stranger that sojourneth with thee,<br><a name="7">7</a>  And for thy cattle, and for the beast that [are] in thy land, shall all the increase thereof be meat.<br><a name="8">8</a>. And thou shalt number seven sabbaths of years unto thee, seven times seven years; and the space of the seven sabbaths of years shall be unto thee forty and nine years.<br><a name="9">9</a>  Then shalt thou cause the trumpet of the jubile to sound on the tenth [day] of the seventh month, in the day of atonement shall ye make the trumpet sound throughout all your land.<br><a name="10">10</a>  And ye shall hallow the fiftieth year, and proclaim liberty throughout [all] the land unto all the inhabitants thereof: it shall be a jubile unto you; and ye shall return every man unto his possession, and ye shall return every man unto his family.<br><a name="11">11</a>  A jubile shall that fiftieth year be unto you: ye shall not sow, neither reap that which groweth of itself in it, nor gather [the grapes] in it of thy vine undressed.<br><a name="12">12</a>  For it [is] the jubile; it shall be holy unto you: ye shall eat the increase thereof out of the field.<br><a name="13">13</a>  In the year of this jubile ye shall return every man unto his possession.<br><a name="14">14</a>  And if thou sell ought unto thy neighbour, or buyest [ought] of thy neighbour's hand, ye shall not oppress one another:<br><a name="15">15</a>  According to the number of years after the jubile thou shalt buy of thy neighbour, [and] according unto the number of years of the fruits he shall sell unto thee:<br><a name="16">16</a>  According to the multitude of years thou shalt increase the price thereof, and according to the fewness of years thou shalt diminish the price of it: for [according] to the number [of the years] of the fruits doth he sell unto thee.<br><a name="17">17</a>  Ye shall not therefore oppress one another; but thou shalt fear thy God: for I [am] the LORD your God.<br><a name="18">18</a>  Wherefore ye shall do my statutes, and keep my judgments, and do them; and ye shall dwell in the land in safety.<br><a name="19">19</a>  And the land shall yield her fruit, and ye shall eat your fill, and dwell therein in safety.<br><a name="20">20</a>  And if ye shall say, What shall we eat the seventh year? behold, we shall not sow, nor gather in our increase:<br><a name="21">21</a>  Then I will command my blessing upon you in the sixth year, and it shall bring forth fruit for three years.<br><a name="22">22</a>  And ye shall sow the eighth year, and eat [yet] of old fruit until the ninth year; until her fruits come in ye shall eat [of] the old [store].<br><a name="23">23</a>. The land shall not be sold for ever: for the land [is] mine; for ye [are] strangers and sojourners with me.<br><a name="24">24</a>  And in all the land of your possession ye shall grant a redemption for the land.<br><a name="25">25</a>  If thy brother be waxen poor, and hath sold away [some] of his possession, and if any of his kin come to redeem it, then shall he redeem that which his brother sold.<br><a name="26">26</a>  And if the man have none to redeem it, and himself be able to redeem it;<br><a name="27">27</a>  Then let him count the years of the sale thereof, and restore the overplus unto the man to whom he sold it; that he may return unto his possession.<br><a name="28">28</a>  But if he be not able to restore [it] to him, then that which is sold shall remain in the hand of him that hath bought it until the year of jubile: and in the jubile it shall go out, and he shall return unto his possession.<br><a name="29">29</a>  And if a man sell a dwelling house in a walled city, then he may redeem it within a whole year after it is sold; [within] a full year may he redeem it.<br><a name="30">30</a>  And if it be not redeemed within the space of a full year, then the house that [is] in the walled city shall be established for ever to him that bought it throughout his generations: it shall not go out in the jubile.<br><a name="31">31</a>  But the houses of the villages which have no wall round about them shall be counted as the fields of the country: they may be redeemed, and they shall go out in the jubile.<br><a name="32">32</a>  Notwithstanding the cities of the Levites, [and] the houses of the cities of their possession, may the Levites redeem at any time.<br><a name="33">33</a>  And if a man purchase of the Levites, then the house that was sold, and the city of his possession, shall go out in [the year of] jubile: for the houses of the cities of the Levites [are] their possession among the children of Israel.<br><a name="34">34</a>  But the field of the suburbs of their cities may not be sold; for it [is] their perpetual possession.<br><a name="35">35</a>  And if thy brother be waxen poor, and fallen in decay with thee; then thou shalt relieve him: [yea, though he be] a stranger, or a sojourner; that he may live with thee.<br><a name="36">36</a>  Take thou no usury of him, or increase: but fear thy God; that thy brother may live with thee.<br><a name="37">37</a>  Thou shalt not give him thy money upon usury, nor lend him thy victuals for increase.<br><a name="38">38</a>  I [am] the LORD your God, which brought you forth out of the land of Egypt, to give you the land of Canaan, [and] to be your God.<br><a name="39">39</a>. And if thy brother [that dwelleth] by thee be waxen poor, and be sold unto thee; thou shalt not compel him to serve as a bondservant:<br><a name="40">40</a>  [But] as an hired servant, [and] as a sojourner, he shall be with thee, [and] shall serve thee unto the year of jubile:<br><a name="41">41</a>  And [then] shall he depart from thee, [both] he and his children with him, and shall return unto his own family, and unto the possession of his fathers shall he return.<br><a name="42">42</a>  For they [are] my servants, which I brought forth out of the land of Egypt: they shall not be sold as bondmen.<br><a name="43">43</a>  Thou shalt not rule over him with rigour; but shalt fear thy God.<br><a name="44">44</a>  Both thy bondmen, and thy bondmaids, which thou shalt have, [shall be] of the heathen that are round about you; of them shall ye buy bondmen and bondmaids.<br><a name="45">45</a>  Moreover of the children of the strangers that do sojourn among you, of them shall ye buy, and of their families that [are] with you, which they begat in your land: and they shall be your possession.<br><a name="46">46</a>  And ye shall take them as an inheritance for your children after you, to inherit [them for] a possession; they shall be your bondmen for ever: but over your brethren the children of Israel, ye shall not rule one over another with rigour.<br><a name="47">47</a>  And if a sojourner or stranger wax rich by thee, and thy brother [that dwelleth] by him wax poor, and sell himself unto the stranger [or] sojourner by thee, or to the stock of the stranger's family:<br><a name="48">48</a>  After that he is sold he may be redeemed again; one of his brethren may redeem him:<br><a name="49">49</a>  Either his uncle, or his uncle's son, may redeem him, or [any] that is nigh of kin unto him of his family may redeem him; or if he be able, he may redeem himself.<br><a name="50">50</a>  And he shall reckon with him that bought him from the year that he was sold to him unto the year of jubile: and the price of his sale shall be according unto the number of years, according to the time of an hired servant shall it be with him.<br><a name="51">51</a>  If [there be] yet many years [behind], according unto them he shall give again the price of his redemption out of the money that he was bought for.<br><a name="52">52</a>  And if there remain but few years unto the year of jubile, then he shall count with him, [and] according unto his years shall he give him again the price of his redemption.<br><a name="53">53</a>  [And] as a yearly hired servant shall he be with him: [and the other] shall not rule with rigour over him in thy sight.<br><a name="54">54</a>  And if he be not redeemed in these [years], then he shall go out in the year of jubile, [both] he, and his children with him.<br><a name="55">55</a>  For unto me the children of Israel [are] servants; they [are] my servants whom I brought forth out of the land of Egypt: I [am] the LORD your God.<br><br>Go to <a href="lev26.htm#1">Leviticus 26</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
