Psalms  84<br>1. To the chief Musician upon Gittith, A Psalm for the sons of Korah. How amiable [are] thy tabernacles, O LORD of hosts!<br><a name="2">2</a>  My soul longeth, yea, even fainteth for the courts of the LORD: my heart and my flesh crieth out for the living God.<br><a name="3">3</a>  Yea, the sparrow hath found an house, and the swallow a nest for herself, where she may lay her young, [even] thine altars, O LORD of hosts, my King, and my God.<br><a name="4">4</a>  Blessed [are] they that dwell in thy house: they will be still praising thee. Selah.<br><a name="5">5</a>  Blessed [is] the man whose strength [is] in thee; in whose heart [are] the ways [of them].<br><a name="6">6</a>  [Who] passing through the valley of Baca make it a well; the rain also filleth the pools.<br><a name="7">7</a>  They go from strength to strength, [every one of them] in Zion appeareth before God.<br><a name="8">8</a>. O LORD God of hosts, hear my prayer: give ear, O God of Jacob. Selah.<br><a name="9">9</a>  Behold, O God our shield, and look upon the face of thine anointed.<br><a name="10">10</a>  For a day in thy courts [is] better than a thousand. I had rather be a doorkeeper in the house of my God, than to dwell in the tents of wickedness.<br><a name="11">11</a>  For the LORD God [is] a sun and shield: the LORD will give grace and glory: no good [thing] will he withhold from them that walk uprightly.<br><a name="12">12</a>  O LORD of hosts, blessed [is] the man that trusteth in thee.<br><br>Go to <a href="psa85.htm#1">Psalm 85</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
