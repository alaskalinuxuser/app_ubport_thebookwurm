Hosea  13<br>1. When Ephraim spake trembling, he exalted himself in Israel; but when he offended in Baal, he died.<br><a name="2">2</a>  And now they sin more and more, and have made them molten images of their silver, [and] idols according to their own understanding, all of it the work of the craftsmen: they say of them, Let the men that sacrifice kiss the calves.<br><a name="3">3</a>  Therefore they shall be as the morning cloud, and as the early dew that passeth away, as the chaff [that] is driven with the whirlwind out of the floor, and as the smoke out of the chimney.<br><a name="4">4</a>  Yet I [am] the LORD thy God from the land of Egypt, and thou shalt know no god but me: for [there is] no saviour beside me.<br><a name="5">5</a>. I did know thee in the wilderness, in the land of great drought.<br><a name="6">6</a>  According to their pasture, so were they filled; they were filled, and their heart was exalted; therefore have they forgotten me.<br><a name="7">7</a>  Therefore I will be unto them as a lion: as a leopard by the way will I observe [them]:<br><a name="8">8</a>  I will meet them as a bear [that is] bereaved [of her whelps], and will rend the caul of their heart, and there will I devour them like a lion: the wild beast shall tear them.<br><a name="9">9</a>. O Israel, thou hast destroyed thyself; but in me [is] thine help.<br><a name="10">10</a>  I will be thy king: where [is any other] that may save thee in all thy cities? and thy judges of whom thou saidst, Give me a king and princes?<br><a name="11">11</a>  I gave thee a king in mine anger, and took [him] away in my wrath.<br><a name="12">12</a>  The iniquity of Ephraim [is] bound up; his sin [is] hid.<br><a name="13">13</a>  The sorrows of a travailing woman shall come upon him: he [is] an unwise son; for he should not stay long in [the place of] the breaking forth of children.<br><a name="14">14</a>  I will ransom them from the power of the grave; I will redeem them from death: O death, I will be thy plagues; O grave, I will be thy destruction: repentance shall be hid from mine eyes.<br><a name="15">15</a>  Though he be fruitful among [his] brethren, an east wind shall come, the wind of the LORD shall come up from the wilderness, and his spring shall become dry, and his fountain shall be dried up: he shall spoil the treasure of all pleasant vessels.<br><a name="16">16</a>  Samaria shall become desolate; for she hath rebelled against her God: they shall fall by the sword: their infants shall be dashed in pieces, and their women with child shall be ripped up.<br><br>Go to <a href="hos14.htm#1">Hosea 14</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
