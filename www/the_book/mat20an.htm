<dl><dt>
<b><i>20:1 For the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man [that is] an householder,<br>
which went out early in the morning to hire labourers into his vineyard.<br>
20:2 And when he had agreed with the labourers for a penny </b></i>{GK=denarius}<i><b> a day,<br>
he sent them into his vineyard.<br>
20:3 And he went out about the third hour </b></i>{ie., 9 am; Hebrew time reckoning began at sunrise}<i><b>,<br>and saw others standing idle in the marketplace,<br>
20:4 And said unto them; Go ye also into the vineyard, and whatsoever is right I will give you.<br>
And they went their way.<br>
20:5 Again he went out about the sixth and ninth hour </b></i>{ie., 12 noon and 3 pm}<i><b>, and did likewise.<br>
20:6 And about the eleventh hour </b></i>{ie., 6 pm}<b><i> he went out, and found others standing idle,<br>
and saith unto them, Why stand ye here all the day idle?<br>
20:7 They say unto him, Because no man hath hired us.<br>
He saith unto them, Go ye also into the vineyard; and whatsoever is right, [that] shall ye receive.<br>
20:8 So when even was come, the lord of the vineyard saith unto his steward,<br>
Call the labourers, and give them [their] hire, beginning from the last unto the first.<br>
20:9 And when they came that [were hired] about the eleventh hour,<br>
they received every man a penny.<br>
20:10 But when the first came, they supposed that they should have received more;<br>
and they likewise received every man a penny.<br>
20:11 And when they had received [it], they murmured against the goodman of the house,<br>
20:12 Saying, These last have wrought </b></i>{ie., worked}<i><b> [but] one hour,<br>
and thou hast made them equal unto us, which have borne the burden and heat of the day.<br>
20:13 But he answered one of them, and said,<br>
Friend, I do thee no wrong: didst not thou agree with me for a penny?<br>
20:14 Take [that] thine [is], and go thy way: I will give unto this last, even as unto thee.<br>
20:15 Is it not lawful for me to do what I will with mine own?<br>
Is thine eye evil, because I am good?<br>
20:16 So the last shall be first, and the first last: for many be called, but few chosen.</i></b></dt><dl>
<dt>This Parable of the Laborers continues the discussion regarding rewards from <a href="mat19.htm#27">19:27-30</a>.<ol type="a">
<li>The basis of reward -<ul><li>is <b>not</b> the size of the task, or length of service, or importance of position, but<li>is faithfulness to the task assigned by the Master. cp. <a href="1cor4.htm#1">1Cor 4:1,2</a>; <a href="1cor9.htm#24">9:24,25</a>; <a href="2tim4.htm#7">2Tim 4:7,8</a></ul>
<li>The distribution of reward - is at the Lord's discretion. <a href="1cor4.htm#3">1Cor 4:3-8</a>; <a href="jam5.htm#9">Jam 5:9-11</a><ul>
<li>"The complaint of these laborers (<a href="mat20.htm#10" target="lwr_lt">v.10-12</a>) reveals their character. They had been dealt with fairly; they protested because others had been dealt with generously." [New ScofRB]
<li>Those servants, who are properly motivated to His service, yearn not so much for reward, as to please Him. cp. <a href="mat25.htm#21">Mat 25:21</a>; <a href="eph2.htm#4">Eph 2:4-10</a></ul></ol>
<dt>the last shall be first, and the first last...- <a href="1cor4.htm#9">1Cor 4:9-16</a><ul>
<li>for many are called {GK=kletos, called, invited} -<dd>
Each man must respond in his own way. cp. <a href="mat4.htm#19">Mat 4:19,20</a>; <a href="mat19.htm#21">19:21,22</a></dd>
<li>but few are 'chosen' {GK=eklektos, picked out, selected, elected, cp. word usage in <a href="1pet1.htm#2">1Pet 1:2</a>; <a href="1pet2.htm#9">2:9</a>}-<br>Although God takes an active role in the choice (or, election) of His servants, it is also true that the chosen are those who have accepted His call.</ul>
<dd>These statements appear, here, in the context of a discussion of rewards to Christ's servants.<ul>
<li>Some who are called, are not faithful. cp. <a href="mat21.htm#28">Mat 21:28-32</a>
<li>Christ's true servants are those who are ''called, chosen, and faithful.'' <a href="rev17.htm#14">Rev 17:14</a>; <a href="2pet1.htm#10">2Pet 1:10,11</a></ul></dl><dt>&nbsp;
<dt><b><i>20:17 And Jesus going up to Jerusalem took the twelve disciples apart </b></i>{ie., aside}<i><b> in the way,<br>
and said unto them,<br>
20:18 Behold, we go up to Jerusalem;<br>
and the Son of man shall be betrayed unto the chief priests and unto the scribes,<br>
and they shall condemn him to death,<br>
20:19 And shall deliver him to the Gentiles to mock, and to scourge, and to crucify [him]:<br>
and the third day he shall rise again.</i></b></dt><dl>
<dt>Jesus again announces His death and resurrection. cp. <a href="mar10.htm#32">Mark 10:32-34</a>; <a href="luk18.htm#31">Luk 18:31-34</a>
<dd>(For the previous occasions, see: <a href="mat12.htm#38">Mat 12:38-42</a>; <a href="mat16.htm#21">16:21-28</a>; <a href="mat17.htm#22">17:22,23</a>)
<dd>He is moving, knowingly and purposefully, toward His death.</dl><dt>
<b><i>20:20 Then came to him the mother of Zebedee's children with her sons,<br>
worshipping [him], and desiring a certain thing of him.<br>
20:21 And he said unto her, What wilt thou?<br>
She saith unto him, Grant that these my two sons may sit,<br>
the one on thy right hand, and the other on the left, in thy kingdom.<br>
20:22 But Jesus answered and said, Ye know not what ye ask.<br>
Are ye able to drink of the cup that I shall drink of,<br>
and to be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with?<br>
They say unto him, We are able.<br>
20:23 And he saith unto them,<br>
Ye shall drink indeed of my cup, and be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with:<br>
but to sit on my right hand, and on my left, is not mine to give,<br>
but [it shall be given to them] for whom it is prepared of my Father.</i></b></dt><dl>
<dt>The request by the mother of James and John (cp. <a href="mar10.htm#35">Mark 10:35-45</a>) 
<dd>seems jarringly insensitive, following immediately upon Jesus' announcement of His own death.
<dt>ye know not what ye ask- 
<dd>They did not comprehend the consequences of His journey to Jerusalem.
<dd>They did not understand the workings of His Kingdom.
<dd>They did not understand His two questions, though they answer affirmatively.--<ol type="1">
<li>Are ye able to drink indeed of my cup?... <br>...Ye shall indeed drink of my cup...-<dd>His cup was His sacrificial death for sin. cp. <a href="mat26.htm#39">Mat 26:39,42</a>; <a href="mat27.htm#46">27:46</a>; <a href="2cor5.htm#21">2Cor 5:21</a></dd><dd>They could not drink that cup. But they would drink <i>of</i> it. <a href="mat20.htm#23" target="lwr_lt">v.23</a>; cp. <a href="mat26.htm#27">Mat 26:27,28</a></dd><dd>Because He drank the deadly cup of salvation, we who believe in Him partake of salvation.</dd><dd>He paid the penalty of death, we receive the free gift of eternal life. <a href="rom6.htm#23">Rom 6:23</a></dd>
<li>{Are ye able} to be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with?...<br>...Ye shall... indeed... be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with.- <dd>Baptism (immersion) pictures total union and identification with something.</dd><dd>Jesus was so identified with the Father and His will, that He was obedient even unto death.</dd><dd>Likewise, believers are identified with Him in His death and resurrection,</dd><dd>as His children, as members of His Body, and as partakers in His service, sufferings, and future glory.</dd><dd>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cp. <a href="1cor12.htm#13">1Cor 12:13</a>; <a href="rom6.htm#3">Rom 6:3,4</a>; <a href="rom8.htm#16">Rom 8:16,17</a>; <a href="2tim2.htm#11">2Tim 2:11,12</a></dd><dd>It is probable that, here, the Lord was granting James and John, like many other believers since them, the privilege of suffering for His sake (cp. <a href="php1.htm#29">Php 1:29</a>).</dd><dd>James was murdered (<a href="act12.htm#1">Acts 12:1,2</a>). John was exiled (<a href="rev1.htm#9">Rev 1:9</a>).</dd></ol>
<dt>but to sit on my right hand... shall be given to them for whom it is prepared by my Father.
<dd>The assignment of reward, and of a place of honor in heaven, ''is not mine to give,''<br>
because our rewards will be determined by our service (work) for Him here. cp. <a href="php3.htm#14">Php 3:14</a><br>
Jesus expands upon this thought in <a href="mat20.htm#24" target="lwr_lt">v.24-28</a>.</dl><dt>
<b><i>20:24 And when the ten heard [it],<br>
they were moved with indignation against the two brethren.<br>
20:25 But Jesus called them [unto him], and said,<br>
Ye know that the princes of the Gentiles exercise dominion over them,<br>
and they that are great exercise authority upon them.<br>
20:26 But it shall not be so among you:<br>
but whosoever will be great among you, let him be your minister;<br>
20:27 And whosoever will be chief among you, let him be your servant:<br>
20:28 Even as the Son of man came not to be ministered unto,<br>
but to minister, and to give his life a ransom for many.</i></b></dt><dl>
<dt>they were moved with indignation.- 
<dd>The question of their relative greatness was a continuing point of contention between the disciples. cp. <a href="mat18.htm#1">Mat 18:1</a>; <a href="luk22.htm#22">Luk 22:22-27</a>
<dt>whosoever will be great {GK=megas, large in importance}...  chief {GK=protos, first, principal}...- <ul>
<li>let him be your minister - GK=diakonos, an attendant, a waiter. ie., One who cares for another.
<li>let him be your servant- GK=doulos, a slave, a bondslave. ie., One totally devoted to another.
cp. <a href="joh13.htm#13">Joh 13:13-17</a>; <a href="1pet5.htm#1">1Pet 5:1-5</a></ul>
<dt>even as the Son of man came... to minister... to give His life a ransom...-
<dd>He provides Himself as the example of a servant.<br>
In doing so, He again speaks of His death. cp. <a href="php2.htm#4">Php 2:4-8</a>
<dt>a ransom for many.- He died for <i>all</i> (eg., <a href="1joh2.htm#2">1Joh 2:2</a>).<dd>But only those <i>'many,'</i> who trust in Him, are ransomed.
<br>cp. <a href="isa53.htm#6">Isa 53:6,10,11</a>; <a href="2cor5.htm#14">2Cor 5:14</a>; <a href="joh10.htm#11">Joh 10:11,14,15</a>; <a href="1tim2.htm#5">1Tim 2:5,6</a>; <a href="heb9.htm#28">Heb 9:28</a>; <a href="1pet1.htm#18">1Pet 1:18,19</a>
</dl><dt>&nbsp;
<dt><b><i>20:29 And as they departed from Jericho, a great multitude followed him.<br>
20:30 And, behold, two blind men sitting by the way side,<br>
when they heard that Jesus passed by, cried out, saying,<br>
Have mercy on us, O Lord, [thou] Son of David.</b></i> {cp. <a href="mat1.htm#1">Mat 1:1</a>; <a href="luk1.htm#31">Luk 1:31,32</a>}<i><b><br>
20:31 And the multitude rebuked them, because they should hold their peace:<br>
but they cried the more, saying, Have mercy on us, O Lord, [thou] Son of David.<br>
20:32 And Jesus stood still, and called them, and said,<br>
What will ye that I shall do unto you?<br>
20:33 They say unto him, Lord, that our eyes may be opened.<br>
20:34 So Jesus had compassion [on them],</b></i> {cp. <a href="mat9.htm#36">Mat 9:36</a>; <a href="mat14.htm#14">14:14</a>; <a href="mat15.htm#32">15:32</a>; <a href="mat18.htm#27">18:27</a>}<i><b><br>
and touched their eyes:<br>
and immediately their eyes received sight, and they followed him.</i></b></dt><dl>
<dt>two blind men...- cp. <a href="mar10.htm#46">Mark 10:46-52</a>; <a href="luk18.htm#35">Luk 18:35-43</a>
<dd>The three accounts differ slightly.-<ol type="1">
<li><i>One or two blind men?</i> -<dd>Mark mentions Bartimaeus by name. Perhaps he was the more vocal of the two men, and Mark and Luke simply focused on him.</dd>
<li><i>While going into Jericho</i> {<a href="luk18.htm#35">Luk 18:35</a>}<i>, or while departing Jericho</i> {<a href="mat20.htm#29" target="lwr_lt">v.29</a>; <a href="mar10.htm#46">Mark 10:46</a>}<i>?</i> -<dd>There were two adjacent townsites for Jericho. The incident may have occurred as they left 'old Jericho,' and began to enter the 'new Jericho.'</dd>
<li><i>Two separate incidents?</i> -<dd>Perhaps Mark and Luke record the healing of Bartimaeus as Jesus departed old Jericho for new Jericho.</dd><dd>Word of his healing spread, and two additional blind men entreated Jesus as He departed new Jericho, in Matthew's account.</dd></ol>
<dt>Have mercy on us, O Lord, thou Son of David.-
<dd>Jesus had previously refused such an appeal by a gentile woman. <a href="mat15.htm#22">Mat 15:22-24</a>
<dd>He honors this request, because these men, being Jews, have the right to appeal to Israel's King.
<dt>What will ye that I do unto you?- He asks them to identify their need.
<dd>So, we must confess our sin, desiring to be cleansed of it, before He can be our Savior. cp. <a href="1joh1.htm#5">1Joh 1:5-10</a>; <a href="col1.htm#12">Col 1:12-14</a>
<dt>immediately their eyes received sight, and they followed Him.-
<dd>Where is He going? He is going to the cross. <a href="mat20.htm#17" target="lwr_lt">v.17-19</a>; <a href="mat20.htm#28" target="lwr_lt">v.28</a>; <a href="mat16.htm#24">16:24-27</a>
