2Corinthians   3<br> 1. Do we begin again to commend ourselves? or need we, as some [others], epistles of commendation to you, or [letters] of commendation from you?<br><a name="2">2</a>  Ye are our epistle written in our hearts, known and read of all men:<br><a name="3">3</a>  [Forasmuch as ye are] manifestly declared to be the epistle of Christ ministered by us, written not with ink, but with the Spirit of the living God; not in tables of stone, but in fleshy tables of the heart.<br><a name="4">4</a>  And such trust have we through Christ to God-ward:<br><a name="5">5</a>  Not that we are sufficient of ourselves to think any thing as of ourselves; but our sufficiency [is] of God;<br><a name="6">6</a>. Who also hath made us able ministers of the new testament; not of the letter, but of the spirit: for the letter killeth, but the spirit giveth life.<br><a name="7">7</a>  But if the ministration of death, written [and] engraven in stones, was glorious, so that the children of Israel could not stedfastly behold the face of Moses for the glory of his countenance; which [glory] was to be done away:<br><a name="8">8</a>  How shall not the ministration of the spirit be rather glorious?<br><a name="9">9</a>  For if the ministration of condemnation [be] glory, much more doth the ministration of righteousness exceed in glory.<br><a name="10">10</a>  For even that which was made glorious had no glory in this respect, by reason of the glory that excelleth.<br><a name="11">11</a>  For if that which is done away [was] glorious, much more that which remaineth [is] glorious.<br><a name="12">12</a>. Seeing then that we have such hope, we use great plainness of speech:<br><a name="13">13</a>  And not as Moses, [which] put a vail over his face, that the children of Israel could not stedfastly look to the end of that which is abolished:<br><a name="14">14</a>  But their minds were blinded: for until this day remaineth the same vail untaken away in the reading of the old testament; which [vail] is done away in Christ.<br><a name="15">15</a>  But even unto this day, when Moses is read, the vail is upon their heart.<br><a name="16">16</a>  Nevertheless when it shall turn to the Lord, the vail shall be taken away.<br><a name="17">17</a>  Now the Lord is that Spirit: and where the Spirit of the Lord [is], there [is] liberty.<br><a name="18">18</a>  But we all, with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord, are changed into the same image from glory to glory, [even] as by the Spirit of the Lord.<br><br>Go to <a href="2cor4.htm#1">II Corinthians 4</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
