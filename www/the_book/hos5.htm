Hosea   5<br> 1. Hear ye this, O priests; and hearken, ye house of Israel; and give ye ear, O house of the king; for judgment [is] toward you, because ye have been a snare on Mizpah, and a net spread upon Tabor.<br><a name="2">2</a>  And the revolters are profound to make slaughter, though I [have been] a rebuker of them all.<br><a name="3">3</a>  I know Ephraim, and Israel is not hid from me: for now, O Ephraim, thou committest whoredom, [and] Israel is defiled.<br><a name="4">4</a>  They will not frame their doings to turn unto their God: for the spirit of whoredoms [is] in the midst of them, and they have not known the LORD.<br><a name="5">5</a>  And the pride of Israel doth testify to his face: therefore shall Israel and Ephraim fall in their iniquity; Judah also shall fall with them.<br><a name="6">6</a>  They shall go with their flocks and with their herds to seek the LORD; but they shall not find [him]; he hath withdrawn himself from them.<br><a name="7">7</a>  They have dealt treacherously against the LORD: for they have begotten strange children: now shall a month devour them with their portions.<br><a name="8">8</a>. Blow ye the cornet in Gibeah, [and] the trumpet in Ramah: cry aloud [at] Bethaven, after thee, O Benjamin.<br><a name="9">9</a>  Ephraim shall be desolate in the day of rebuke: among the tribes of Israel have I made known that which shall surely be.<br><a name="10">10</a>  The princes of Judah were like them that remove the bound: [therefore] I will pour out my wrath upon them like water.<br><a name="11">11</a>  Ephraim [is] oppressed [and] broken in judgment, because he willingly walked after the commandment.<br><a name="12">12</a>  Therefore [will] I [be] unto Ephraim as a moth, and to the house of Judah as rottenness.<br><a name="13">13</a>  When Ephraim saw his sickness, and Judah [saw] his wound, then went Ephraim to the Assyrian, and sent to king Jareb: yet could he not heal you, nor cure you of your wound.<br><a name="14">14</a>  For I [will be] unto Ephraim as a lion, and as a young lion to the house of Judah: I, [even] I, will tear and go away; I will take away, and none shall rescue [him].<br><a name="15">15</a>  I will go [and] return to my place, till they acknowledge their offence, and seek my face: in their affliction they will seek me early.<br><br>Go to <a href="hos6.htm#1">Hosea 6</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
