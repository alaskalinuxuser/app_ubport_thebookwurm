Proverbs  10<br>1. The proverbs of Solomon. A wise son maketh a glad father: but a foolish son [is] the heaviness of his mother.<br><a name="2">2</a>. Treasures of wickedness profit nothing: but righteousness delivereth from death.<br><a name="3">3</a>  The LORD will not suffer the soul of the righteous to famish: but he casteth away the substance of the wicked.<br><a name="4">4</a>. He becometh poor that dealeth [with] a slack hand: but the hand of the diligent maketh rich.<br><a name="5">5</a>. He that gathereth in summer [is] a wise son: [but] he that sleepeth in harvest [is] a son that causeth shame.<br><a name="6">6</a>. Blessings [are] upon the head of the just: but violence covereth the mouth of the wicked.<br><a name="7">7</a>. The memory of the just [is] blessed: but the name of the wicked shall rot.<br><a name="8">8</a>. The wise in heart will receive commandments: but a prating fool shall fall.<br><a name="9">9</a>. He that walketh uprightly walketh surely: but he that perverteth his ways shall be known.<br><a name="10">10</a>. He that winketh with the eye causeth sorrow: but a prating fool shall fall.<br><a name="11">11</a>. The mouth of a righteous [man is] a well of life: but violence covereth the mouth of the wicked.<br><a name="12">12</a>. Hatred stirreth up strifes: but love covereth all sins.<br><a name="13">13</a>. In the lips of him that hath understanding wisdom is found: but a rod [is] for the back of him that is void of understanding.<br><a name="14">14</a>. Wise [men] lay up knowledge: but the mouth of the foolish [is] near destruction.<br><a name="15">15</a>. The rich man's wealth [is] his strong city: the destruction of the poor [is] their poverty.<br><a name="16">16</a>. The labour of the righteous [tendeth] to life: the fruit of the wicked to sin.<br><a name="17">17</a>. He [is in] the way of life that keepeth instruction: but he that refuseth reproof erreth.<br><a name="18">18</a>. He that hideth hatred [with] lying lips, and he that uttereth a slander, [is] a fool.<br><a name="19">19</a>. In the multitude of words there wanteth not sin: but he that refraineth his lips [is] wise.<br><a name="20">20</a>. The tongue of the just [is as] choice silver: the heart of the wicked [is] little worth.<br><a name="21">21</a>  The lips of the righteous feed many: but fools die for want of wisdom.<br><a name="22">22</a>. The blessing of the LORD, it maketh rich, and he addeth no sorrow with it.<br><a name="23">23</a>. [It is] as sport to a fool to do mischief: but a man of understanding hath wisdom.<br><a name="24">24</a>. The fear of the wicked, it shall come upon him: but the desire of the righteous shall be granted.<br><a name="25">25</a>  As the whirlwind passeth, so [is] the wicked no [more]: but the righteous [is] an everlasting foundation.<br><a name="26">26</a>. As vinegar to the teeth, and as smoke to the eyes, so [is] the sluggard to them that send him.<br><a name="27">27</a>. The fear of the LORD prolongeth days: but the years of the wicked shall be shortened.<br><a name="28">28</a>  The hope of the righteous [shall be] gladness: but the expectation of the wicked shall perish.<br><a name="29">29</a>. The way of the LORD [is] strength to the upright: but destruction [shall be] to the workers of iniquity.<br><a name="30">30</a>  The righteous shall never be removed: but the wicked shall not inhabit the earth.<br><a name="31">31</a>. The mouth of the just bringeth forth wisdom: but the froward tongue shall be cut out.<br><a name="32">32</a>  The lips of the righteous know what is acceptable: but the mouth of the wicked [speaketh] frowardness.<br><br>Go to <a href="pro11.htm#1">Proverbs 11</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
