<h3>The Believer's Standing and State</h3>
<dl>
<dt>A distinction of vast importance to the right understanding of the Scriptures, especially of the Epistles, is that which concerns the standing or position of the believer, and his state or walk. The first is the result of the work of Christ and is perfect and entire from the very moment that Christ is received by faith. Nothing in the afterlife of the believer adds in the smallest degree to his title of favor with God, nor to his perfect security. Through faith alone this standing before God is conferred, and before Him the weakest person, if he be but a true believer on the Lord Jesus Christ, has precisely the same title as the most illustrious saint.<br><br>
What that title or standing is, may be briefly seen from the following Scriptures:
<dd>-&quot;But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the <i>sons of God,</i> even to them that believe on his name.&quot; (<a href="joh1.htm#12">John 1:12</a>)
<dd>-&quot;Whosoever believeth that Jesus is the Christ is <i>born of God.</i>&quot; (<a href="1joh5.htm#1">1John 5:1</a>)
<dd>-&quot;And if children, then <i>heirs;</i> heirs of God, and joint heirs with Christ.&quot; (<a href="rom8.htm#17">Rom 8:17</a>)
<dd>-&quot;To <i>an inheritance</i> incorruptible, and undefiled, and that fadeth not away, reserved in heaven for you, who are kept by the power of God through faith unto salvation ready to be revealed in the last time.&quot; (<a href="1pet1.htm#4">1Pet 1:4-5</a>)
<dd>-&quot;In whom also we <i>have obtained an inheritance.</i>&quot; (<a href="eph1.htm#11">Eph 1:11</a>)
<dd>-&quot;Beloved, <i>now are we the sons of God;</i> and it doth not yet appear what we shall be: but we know that, when he shall appear, <i>we shall be like him.</i>&quot; (<a href="1joh3.htm#2">1John 3:2</a>)
<dd>-&quot;But ye are a chosen generation, a <i>royal priesthood,</i> an holy nation.&quot; (<a href="1pet2.htm#9">1Pet 2:9</a>)
<dd>-&quot;Unto him that loved us, <i>and washed us from our sins</i> in his own blood, and hath made us <i>kings and priests</i> unto God and his Father.&quot; (<a href="rev1.htm#5">Rev 1:5-6</a>)
<dd>-&quot;And <i>ye are complete in him,</i> which is the head of all principality and power.&quot; (<a href="col2.htm#10">Col 2:10</a>)
<dd>-&quot;Therefore being justified by faith, we have <i>peace with God</i> through our Lord Jesus Christ: By whom also we have access by faith into <i>this grace wherein we stand,</i> and rejoice in hope of the glory of God.&quot; (<a href="rom5.htm#1">Rom 5:1-2</a>)
<dd>-&quot;For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but <i>have everlasting life.</i>&quot; (<a href="joh3.htm#16">John 3:16</a>)
<dd>-&quot;These things have I written unto you that believe on the name of the Son of God; <i>that ye may know</i> that ye have eternal life.&quot; (<a href="1joh5.htm#13">1John 5:13</a>)
<dd>-&quot;Having therefore, brethren, <i>boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus</i>...&quot; (<a href="heb10.htm#19">Heb 10:19</a>)
<dd>-&quot;Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who hath blessed us with <i>all spiritual blessings.</i>&quot; (<a href="eph1.htm#3">Eph 1:3</a>)
<dd>-&quot;To the praise of the glory of his grace, wherein he hath made us <i>accepted in the beloved.</i>&quot; (<a href="eph1.htm#6">Eph 1:6</a>)
<dd>-&quot;But God, who is rich in mercy, for his great love wherewith he loved us, even when we were dead in sins, hath <i>quickened us [ie., made us alive] together with Christ</i> (by grace ye are saved), and hath raised us up together, and made us sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus.&quot; (<a href="eph2.htm#4">Eph 2:4-6</a>)
<dd>-&quot;But now, in Christ Jesus, ye who sometime were far off, are <i>made nigh</i> by the blood of Christ.&quot; (<a href="eph2.htm#13">Eph 2:13</a>)
<dd>-&quot;In whom also, after that ye believed, ye were <i>sealed</i> with that Holy Spirit of promise.&quot; (<a href="eph1.htm#13">Eph 1:13</a>)
<dd>-&quot;For by one Spirit are we all baptized <i>into one body.</i> (<a href="1cor12.htm#13">1Cor 12:13</a>)
<dd>-&quot;For we are <i>members of his body,</i> of his flesh, and of his bones.&quot; (<a href="eph5.htm#30">Eph 5:30</a>)
<dd>-&quot;What? know ye not that your body is the <i>temple of the Holy Ghost?</i>&quot; (<a href="1cor6.htm#19">1Cor 6:19</a>)<br>
<dt>Every one of these marvelous things is true of every believer on the Lord Jesus Christ. Not one item in this glorious inventory is said to be gained by prayer, or diligence in service, or church-going, or alms-giving, or self-denial, or holiness of life, or by any other description of good works. All are gifts of God through Christ and therefore belong equally to all believers. When the jailor of Philippi believed on the Lord Jesus Christ, he became at once a child of God, a joint heir with Christ, a king and priest, and had the title to the incorruptible, undefiled, and unfading inheritance. In the instant that he believed with his heart and confessed with his mouth that Jesus was his Lord, he was justified from all things, had peace with God, a standing in His grace, and a sure hope of glory. He received the gift of eternal life, was made accepted in the full measure of Christ's own acceptance, was indwelt by, and sealed with the Holy Spirit, by whom also he was baptized into the mystical body of Christ - the church of God. Instantly he was clothed with the righteousness of God (<a href="rom3.htm#22">Rom 3:22</a>), quickened with Christ, raised with Him, and in Him seated in the heavenlies.<br><br>
What his actual state may have been is quite another matter - certainly it was far, <i>far</i> below his exalted standing in the sight of God. It was not all at once that he became as royal, priestly, and heavenly in walk as he was at once in standing. The following passages will indicate the way one's <i>standing</i> and one's <i>state</i> are constantly discriminated [ie., differentiated] in the Scriptures.<dd><br>

<dt>The student cannot fail to notice that the divine order, under grace, is first to give the highest possible standing and then to exhort the believer to maintain a state in accordance therewith. The beggar is lifted up from the dung-hill and set among princes (<a href="1sam2.htm#8">1Sam 2:8</a>), and then exhorted <i>to be</i> princely. As examples, see the following verses.<dd><br>

<dt>The student will be able to add largely to this list of comparative passages showing that the Scriptures make a clear distinction between the standing and state of the believer. It will be seen that he is not under probation to see if he is worthy of an inconceivably exalted position, but, beginning with the confession of his utter unworthiness, receives the position wholly as the result of Christ's work. Positionally he is &quot;perfected forever&quot; (<a href="heb10.htm#14">Heb 10:14</a>), but looking within, at his state, he must say, &quot;Not as though I had already attained, either were already perfect.&quot; (<a href="php3.htm#12">Php 3:12</a>)<br><br>
It may be said that all the afterwork of God in his behalf, the application of the Word to his walk and conscience (<a href="joh17.htm#17">John 17:17</a>; <a href="eph5.htm#26">Eph 5:26</a>), the chastisements of the Father's hand (<a href="heb12.htm#10">Heb 12:10</a>; <a href="1cor11.htm#32">1Cor 11:32</a>), the ministry of the Spirit (<a href="eph4.htm#11">Eph 4:11-12</a>), all the difficulties and trials of the wilderness way (<a href="1pet4.htm#12">1Pet 4:12-14</a>), and the final transformation when He shall appear (<a href="1joh3.htm#2">1John 3:2</a>), all are intended simply to bring the believer's character into perfect conformity to the position which is his in the instant of his conversion. He grows in grace, indeed, but not <i>into</i> grace.<br><br>
A prince, while he is a little child, is presumably as willful and as ignorant as other little children. Sometimes he may be very obedient and teachable and affectionate, and then he is happy and approved; at other times he may be unruly, self-willed, and disobedient, and then he is unhappy and perhaps is chastised. But he is just as much a prince on the one day as on the other. It may be hoped that, as time goes on, he will learn to bring himself into willing and affectionate subjection to every right way, and then he will be more princely, but not more really a prince. He was <i>born</i> a prince.<br><br>
In the case of every true son of the King of kings, and Lord of lords, this growth into kingliness is assured. In the end, standing and state, character and position, will be equal. But the position is not the reward of the perfected character - the character is developed from the position.
