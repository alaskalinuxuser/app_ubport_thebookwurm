Jeremiah  10<br>1. Hear ye the word which the LORD speaketh unto you, O house of Israel:<br><a name="2">2</a>  Thus saith the LORD, Learn not the way of the heathen, and be not dismayed at the signs of heaven; for the heathen are dismayed at them.<br><a name="3">3</a>  For the customs of the people [are] vain: for [one] cutteth a tree out of the forest, the work of the hands of the workman, with the axe.<br><a name="4">4</a>  They deck it with silver and with gold; they fasten it with nails and with hammers, that it move not.<br><a name="5">5</a>  They [are] upright as the palm tree, but speak not: they must needs be borne, because they cannot go. Be not afraid of them; for they cannot do evil, neither also [is it] in them to do good.<br><a name="6">6</a>  Forasmuch as [there is] none like unto thee, O LORD; thou [art] great, and thy name [is] great in might.<br><a name="7">7</a>  Who would not fear thee, O King of nations? for to thee doth it appertain: forasmuch as among all the wise [men] of the nations, and in all their kingdoms, [there is] none like unto thee.<br><a name="8">8</a>  But they are altogether brutish and foolish: the stock [is] a doctrine of vanities.<br><a name="9">9</a>  Silver spread into plates is brought from Tarshish, and gold from Uphaz, the work of the workman, and of the hands of the founder: blue and purple [is] their clothing: they [are] all the work of cunning [men].<br><a name="10">10</a>  But the LORD [is] the true God, he [is] the living God, and an everlasting king: at his wrath the earth shall tremble, and the nations shall not be able to abide his indignation.<br><a name="11">11</a>  Thus shall ye say unto them, The gods that have not made the heavens and the earth, [even] they shall perish from the earth, and from under these heavens.<br><a name="12">12</a>  He hath made the earth by his power, he hath established the world by his wisdom, and hath stretched out the heavens by his discretion.<br><a name="13">13</a>  When he uttereth his voice, [there is] a multitude of waters in the heavens, and he causeth the vapours to ascend from the ends of the earth; he maketh lightnings with rain, and bringeth forth the wind out of his treasures.<br><a name="14">14</a>  Every man is brutish in [his] knowledge: every founder is confounded by the graven image: for his molten image [is] falsehood, and [there is] no breath in them.<br><a name="15">15</a>  They [are] vanity, [and] the work of errors: in the time of their visitation they shall perish.<br><a name="16">16</a>  The portion of Jacob [is] not like them: for he [is] the former of all [things]; and Israel [is] the rod of his inheritance: The LORD of hosts [is] his name.<br><a name="17">17</a>. Gather up thy wares out of the land, O inhabitant of the fortress.<br><a name="18">18</a>  For thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will sling out the inhabitants of the land at this once, and will distress them, that they may find [it so].<br><a name="19">19</a>  Woe is me for my hurt! my wound is grievous: but I said, Truly this [is] a grief, and I must bear it.<br><a name="20">20</a>  My tabernacle is spoiled, and all my cords are broken: my children are gone forth of me, and they [are] not: [there is] none to stretch forth my tent any more, and to set up my curtains.<br><a name="21">21</a>  For the pastors are become brutish, and have not sought the LORD: therefore they shall not prosper, and all their flocks shall be scattered.<br><a name="22">22</a>  Behold, the noise of the bruit is come, and a great commotion out of the north country, to make the cities of Judah desolate, [and] a den of dragons.<br><a name="23">23</a>  O LORD, I know that the way of man [is] not in himself: [it is] not in man that walketh to direct his steps.<br><a name="24">24</a>  O LORD, correct me, but with judgment; not in thine anger, lest thou bring me to nothing.<br><a name="25">25</a>  Pour out thy fury upon the heathen that know thee not, and upon the families that call not on thy name: for they have eaten up Jacob, and devoured him, and consumed him, and have made his habitation desolate.<br><br>Go to <a href="jer11.htm#1">Jeremiah 11</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
