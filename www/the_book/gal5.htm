Galatians   5<br> 1. Stand fast therefore in the liberty wherewith Christ hath made us free, and be not entangled again with the yoke of bondage.<br><a name="2">2</a>  Behold, I Paul say unto you, that if ye be circumcised, Christ shall profit you nothing.<br><a name="3">3</a>  For I testify again to every man that is circumcised, that he is a debtor to do the whole law.<br><a name="4">4</a>  Christ is become of no effect unto you, whosoever of you are justified by the law; ye are fallen from grace.<br><a name="5">5</a>  For we through the Spirit wait for the hope of righteousness by faith.<br><a name="6">6</a>  For in Jesus Christ neither circumcision availeth any thing, nor uncircumcision; but faith which worketh by love.<br><a name="7">7</a>  Ye did run well; who did hinder you that ye should not obey the truth?<br><a name="8">8</a>  This persuasion [cometh] not of him that calleth you.<br><a name="9">9</a>  A little leaven leaveneth the whole lump.<br><a name="10">10</a>  I have confidence in you through the Lord, that ye will be none otherwise minded: but he that troubleth you shall bear his judgment, whosoever he be.<br><a name="11">11</a>  And I, brethren, if I yet preach circumcision, why do I yet suffer persecution? then is the offence of the cross ceased.<br><a name="12">12</a>  I would they were even cut off which trouble you.<br><a name="13">13</a>. For, brethren, ye have been called unto liberty; only [use] not liberty for an occasion to the flesh, but by love serve one another.<br><a name="14">14</a>  For all the law is fulfilled in one word, [even] in this; Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.<br><a name="15">15</a>  But if ye bite and devour one another, take heed that ye be not consumed one of another.<br><a name="16">16</a>  [This] I say then, Walk in the Spirit, and ye shall not fulfil the lust of the flesh.<br><a name="17">17</a>  For the flesh lusteth against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh: and these are contrary the one to the other: so that ye cannot do the things that ye would.<br><a name="18">18</a>  But if ye be led of the Spirit, ye are not under the law.<br><a name="19">19</a>  Now the works of the flesh are manifest, which are [these]; Adultery, fornication, uncleanness, lasciviousness,<br><a name="20">20</a>  Idolatry, witchcraft, hatred, variance, emulations, wrath, strife, seditions, heresies,<br><a name="21">21</a>  Envyings, murders, drunkenness, revellings, and such like: of the which I tell you before, as I have also told [you] in time past, that they which do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God.<br><a name="22">22</a>  But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, faith,<br><a name="23">23</a>  Meekness, temperance: against such there is no law.<br><a name="24">24</a>  And they that are Christ's have crucified the flesh with the affections and lusts.<br><a name="25">25</a>  If we live in the Spirit, let us also walk in the Spirit.<br><a name="26">26</a>  Let us not be desirous of vain glory, provoking one another, envying one another.<br><br>Go to <a href="gal6.htm#1">Galatians 6</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
