Acts  28<br>1. And when they were escaped, then they knew that the island was called Melita.<br><a name="2">2</a>  And the barbarous people shewed us no little kindness: for they kindled a fire, and received us every one, because of the present rain, and because of the cold.<br><a name="3">3</a>  And when Paul had gathered a bundle of sticks, and laid [them] on the fire, there came a viper out of the heat, and fastened on his hand.<br><a name="4">4</a>  And when the barbarians saw the [venomous] beast hang on his hand, they said among themselves, No doubt this man is a murderer, whom, though he hath escaped the sea, yet vengeance suffereth not to live.<br><a name="5">5</a>  And he shook off the beast into the fire, and felt no harm.<br><a name="6">6</a>  Howbeit they looked when he should have swollen, or fallen down dead suddenly: but after they had looked a great while, and saw no harm come to him, they changed their minds, and said that he was a god.<br><a name="7">7</a>  In the same quarters were possessions of the chief man of the island, whose name was Publius; who received us, and lodged us three days courteously.<br><a name="8">8</a>  And it came to pass, that the father of Publius lay sick of a fever and of a bloody flux: to whom Paul entered in, and prayed, and laid his hands on him, and healed him.<br><a name="9">9</a>  So when this was done, others also, which had diseases in the island, came, and were healed:<br><a name="10">10</a>  Who also honoured us with many honours; and when we departed, they laded [us] with such things as were necessary.<br><a name="11">11</a>. And after three months we departed in a ship of Alexandria, which had wintered in the isle, whose sign was Castor and Pollux.<br><a name="12">12</a>  And landing at Syracuse, we tarried [there] three days.<br><a name="13">13</a>  And from thence we fetched a compass, and came to Rhegium: and after one day the south wind blew, and we came the next day to Puteoli:<br><a name="14">14</a>  Where we found brethren, and were desired to tarry with them seven days: and so we went toward Rome.<br><a name="15">15</a>  And from thence, when the brethren heard of us, they came to meet us as far as Appii forum, and The three taverns: whom when Paul saw, he thanked God, and took courage.<br><a name="16">16</a>  And when we came to Rome, the centurion delivered the prisoners to the captain of the guard: but Paul was suffered to dwell by himself with a soldier that kept him.<br><a name="17">17</a>. And it came to pass, that after three days Paul called the chief of the Jews together: and when they were come together, he said unto them, Men [and] brethren, though I have committed nothing against the people, or customs of our fathers, yet was I delivered prisoner from Jerusalem into the hands of the Romans.<br><a name="18">18</a>  Who, when they had examined me, would have let [me] go, because there was no cause of death in me.<br><a name="19">19</a>  But when the Jews spake against [it], I was constrained to appeal unto Caesar; not that I had ought to accuse my nation of.<br><a name="20">20</a>  For this cause therefore have I called for you, to see [you], and to speak with [you]: because that for the hope of Israel I am bound with this chain.<br><a name="21">21</a>  And they said unto him, We neither received letters out of Judaea concerning thee, neither any of the brethren that came shewed or spake any harm of thee.<br><a name="22">22</a>  But we desire to hear of thee what thou thinkest: for as concerning this sect, we know that every where it is spoken against.<br><a name="23">23</a>. And when they had appointed him a day, there came many to him into [his] lodging; to whom he expounded and testified the kingdom of God, persuading them concerning Jesus, both out of the law of Moses, and [out of] the prophets, from morning till evening.<br><a name="24">24</a>  And some believed the things which were spoken, and some believed not.<br><a name="25">25</a>  And when they agreed not among themselves, they departed, after that Paul had spoken one word, Well spake the Holy Ghost by Esaias the prophet unto our fathers,<br><a name="26">26</a>  Saying, Go unto this people, and say, Hearing ye shall hear, and shall not understand; and seeing ye shall see, and not perceive:<br><a name="27">27</a>  For the heart of this people is waxed gross, and their ears are dull of hearing, and their eyes have they closed; lest they should see with [their] eyes, and hear with [their] ears, and understand with [their] heart, and should be converted, and I should heal them.<br><a name="28">28</a>  Be it known therefore unto you, that the salvation of God is sent unto the Gentiles, and [that] they will hear it.<br><a name="29">29</a>  And when he had said these words, the Jews departed, and had great reasoning among themselves.<br><a name="30">30</a>. And Paul dwelt two whole years in his own hired house, and received all that came in unto him,<br><a name="31">31</a>  Preaching the kingdom of God, and teaching those things which concern the Lord Jesus Christ, with all confidence, no man forbidding him.<br><br>End of Acts.<br>Go to <a href="rom1.htm#1">Romans 1</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
