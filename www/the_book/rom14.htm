Romans  14<br> 1. Him that is weak in the faith receive ye, [but] not to doubtful disputations.<br><a name="2">2</a>  For one believeth that he may eat all things: another, who is weak, eateth herbs.<br><a name="3">3</a>  Let not him that eateth despise him that eateth not; and let not him which eateth not judge him that eateth: for God hath received him.<br><a name="4">4</a>  Who art thou that judgest another man's servant? to his own master he standeth or falleth. Yea, he shall be holden up: for God is able to make him stand.<br><a name="5">5</a>  One man esteemeth one day above another: another esteemeth every day [alike]. Let every man be fully persuaded in his own mind.<br><a name="6">6</a>  He that regardeth the day, regardeth [it] unto the Lord; and he that regardeth not the day, to the Lord he doth not regard [it]. He that eateth, eateth to the Lord, for he giveth God thanks; and he that eateth not, to the Lord he eateth not, and giveth God thanks.<br><a name="7">7</a>  For none of us liveth to himself, and no man dieth to himself.<br><a name="8">8</a>  For whether we live, we live unto the Lord; and whether we die, we die unto the Lord: whether we live therefore, or die, we are the Lord's.<br><a name="9">9</a>  For to this end Christ both died, and rose, and revived, that he might be Lord both of the dead and living.<br><a name="10">10</a>  But why dost thou judge thy brother? or why dost thou set at nought thy brother? for we shall all stand before the judgment seat of Christ.<br><a name="11">11</a>  For it is written, [As] I live, saith the Lord, every knee shall bow to me, and every tongue shall confess to God.<br><a name="12">12</a>  So then every one of us shall give account of himself to God.<br><a name="13">13</a>  Let us not therefore judge one another any more: but judge this rather, that no man put a stumblingblock or an occasion to fall in [his] brother's way.<br><a name="14">14</a>  I know, and am persuaded by the Lord Jesus, that [there is] nothing unclean of itself: but to him that esteemeth any thing to be unclean, to him [it is] unclean.<br><a name="15">15</a>  But if thy brother be grieved with [thy] meat, now walkest thou not charitably. Destroy not him with thy meat, for whom Christ died.<br><a name="16">16</a>  Let not then your good be evil spoken of:<br><a name="17">17</a>  For the kingdom of God is not meat and drink; but righteousness, and peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost.<br><a name="18">18</a>  For he that in these things serveth Christ [is] acceptable to God, and approved of men.<br><a name="19">19</a>  Let us therefore follow after the things which make for peace, and things wherewith one may edify another.<br><a name="20">20</a>  For meat destroy not the work of God. All things indeed [are] pure; but [it is] evil for that man who eateth with offence.<br><a name="21">21</a>  [It is] good neither to eat flesh, nor to drink wine, nor [any thing] whereby thy brother stumbleth, or is offended, or is made weak.<br><a name="22">22</a>  Hast thou faith? have [it] to thyself before God. Happy [is] he that condemneth not himself in that thing which he alloweth.<br><a name="23">23</a>  And he that doubteth is damned if he eat, because [he eateth] not of faith: for whatsoever [is] not of faith is sin.<br><br>Go to <a href="rom15.htm#1">Romans 15</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
