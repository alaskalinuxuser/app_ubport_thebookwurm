Proverbs   6<br>1. My son, if thou be surety for thy friend, [if] thou hast stricken thy hand with a stranger,<br><a name="2">2</a>  Thou art snared with the words of thy mouth, thou art taken with the words of thy mouth.<br><a name="3">3</a>  Do this now, my son, and deliver thyself, when thou art come into the hand of thy friend; go, humble thyself, and make sure thy friend.<br><a name="4">4</a>  Give not sleep to thine eyes, nor slumber to thine eyelids.<br><a name="5">5</a>  Deliver thyself as a roe from the hand [of the hunter], and as a bird from the hand of the fowler.<br><a name="6">6</a>. Go to the ant, thou sluggard; consider her ways, and be wise:<br><a name="7">7</a>  Which having no guide, overseer, or ruler,<br><a name="8">8</a>  Provideth her meat in the summer, [and] gathereth her food in the harvest.<br><a name="9">9</a>  How long wilt thou sleep, O sluggard? when wilt thou arise out of thy sleep?<br><a name="10">10</a>  [Yet] a little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to sleep:<br><a name="11">11</a>  So shall thy poverty come as one that travelleth, and thy want as an armed man.<br><a name="12">12</a>. A naughty person, a wicked man, walketh with a froward mouth.<br><a name="13">13</a>  He winketh with his eyes, he speaketh with his feet, he teacheth with his fingers;<br><a name="14">14</a>  Frowardness [is] in his heart, he deviseth mischief continually; he soweth discord.<br><a name="15">15</a>  Therefore shall his calamity come suddenly; suddenly shall he be broken without remedy.<br><a name="16">16</a>  These six [things] doth the LORD hate: yea, seven [are] an abomination unto him:<br><a name="17">17</a>  A proud look, a lying tongue, and hands that shed innocent blood,<br><a name="18">18</a>  An heart that deviseth wicked imaginations, feet that be swift in running to mischief,<br><a name="19">19</a>  A false witness [that] speaketh lies, and he that soweth discord among brethren.<br><a name="20">20</a>. My son, keep thy father's commandment, and forsake not the law of thy mother:<br><a name="21">21</a>  Bind them continually upon thine heart, [and] tie them about thy neck.<br><a name="22">22</a>  When thou goest, it shall lead thee; when thou sleepest, it shall keep thee; and [when] thou awakest, it shall talk with thee.<br><a name="23">23</a>  For the commandment [is] a lamp; and the law [is] light; and reproofs of instruction [are] the way of life:<br><a name="24">24</a>  To keep thee from the evil woman, from the flattery of the tongue of a strange woman.<br><a name="25">25</a>  Lust not after her beauty in thine heart; neither let her take thee with her eyelids.<br><a name="26">26</a>  For by means of a whorish woman [a man is brought] to a piece of bread: and the adulteress will hunt for the precious life.<br><a name="27">27</a>  Can a man take fire in his bosom, and his clothes not be burned?<br><a name="28">28</a>  Can one go upon hot coals, and his feet not be burned?<br><a name="29">29</a>  So he that goeth in to his neighbour's wife; whosoever toucheth her shall not be innocent.<br><a name="30">30</a>  [Men] do not despise a thief, if he steal to satisfy his soul when he is hungry;<br><a name="31">31</a>  But [if] he be found, he shall restore sevenfold; he shall give all the substance of his house.<br><a name="32">32</a>  [But] whoso committeth adultery with a woman lacketh understanding: he [that] doeth it destroyeth his own soul.<br><a name="33">33</a>  A wound and dishonour shall he get; and his reproach shall not be wiped away.<br><a name="34">34</a>  For jealousy [is] the rage of a man: therefore he will not spare in the day of vengeance.<br><a name="35">35</a>  He will not regard any ransom; neither will he rest content, though thou givest many gifts.<br><br>Go to <a href="pro7.htm#1">Proverbs 7</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
