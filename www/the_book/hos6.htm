Hosea   6<br> 1. Come, and let us return unto the LORD: for he hath torn, and he will heal us; he hath smitten, and he will bind us up.<br><a name="2">2</a>  After two days will he revive us: in the third day he will raise us up, and we shall live in his sight.<br><a name="3">3</a>  Then shall we know, [if] we follow on to know the LORD: his going forth is prepared as the morning; and he shall come unto us as the rain, as the latter [and] former rain unto the earth.<br><a name="4">4</a>.
