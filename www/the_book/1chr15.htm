1Chronicles  15<br>1. And [David] made him houses in the city of David, and prepared a place for the ark of God, and pitched for it a tent.<br><a name="2">2</a>  Then David said, None ought to carry the ark of God but the Levites: for them hath the LORD chosen to carry the ark of God, and to minister unto him for ever.<br><a name="3">3</a>  And David gathered all Israel together to Jerusalem, to bring up the ark of the LORD unto his place, which he had prepared for it.<br><a name="4">4</a>  And David assembled the children of Aaron, and the Levites:<br><a name="5">5</a>  Of the sons of Kohath; Uriel the chief, and his brethren an hundred and twenty:<br><a name="6">6</a>  Of the sons of Merari; Asaiah the chief, and his brethren two hundred and twenty:<br><a name="7">7</a>  Of the sons of Gershom; Joel the chief, and his brethren an hundred and thirty:<br><a name="8">8</a>  Of the sons of Elizaphan; Shemaiah the chief, and his brethren two hundred:<br><a name="9">9</a>  Of the sons of Hebron; Eliel the chief, and his brethren fourscore:<br><a name="10">10</a>  Of the sons of Uzziel; Amminadab the chief, and his brethren an hundred and twelve.<br><a name="11">11</a>  And David called for Zadok and Abiathar the priests, and for the Levites, for Uriel, Asaiah, and Joel, Shemaiah, and Eliel, and Amminadab,<br><a name="12">12</a>  And said unto them, Ye [are] the chief of the fathers of the Levites: sanctify yourselves, [both] ye and your brethren, that ye may bring up the ark of the LORD God of Israel unto [the place that] I have prepared for it.<br><a name="13">13</a>  For because ye [did it] not at the first, the LORD our God made a breach upon us, for that we sought him not after the due order.<br><a name="14">14</a>  So the priests and the Levites sanctified themselves to bring up the ark of the LORD God of Israel.<br><a name="15">15</a>  And the children of the Levites bare the ark of God upon their shoulders with the staves thereon, as Moses commanded according to the word of the LORD.<br><a name="16">16</a>  And David spake to the chief of the Levites to appoint their brethren [to be] the singers with instruments of musick, psalteries and harps and cymbals, sounding, by lifting up the voice with joy.<br><a name="17">17</a>  So the Levites appointed Heman the son of Joel; and of his brethren, Asaph the son of Berechiah; and of the sons of Merari their brethren, Ethan the son of Kushaiah;<br><a name="18">18</a>  And with them their brethren of the second [degree], Zechariah, Ben, and Jaaziel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehiel, and Unni, Eliab, and Benaiah, and Maaseiah, and Mattithiah, and Elipheleh, and Mikneiah, and Obededom, and Jeiel, the porters.<br><a name="19">19</a>  So the singers, Heman, Asaph, and Ethan, [were appointed] to sound with cymbals of brass;<br><a name="20">20</a>  And Zechariah, and Aziel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehiel, and Unni, and Eliab, and Maaseiah, and Benaiah, with psalteries on Alamoth;<br><a name="21">21</a>  And Mattithiah, and Elipheleh, and Mikneiah, and Obededom, and Jeiel, and Azaziah, with harps on the Sheminith to excel.<br><a name="22">22</a>  And Chenaniah, chief of the Levites, [was] for song: he instructed about the song, because he [was] skilful.<br><a name="23">23</a>  And Berechiah and Elkanah [were] doorkeepers for the ark.<br><a name="24">24</a>  And Shebaniah, and Jehoshaphat, and Nethaneel, and Amasai, and Zechariah, and Benaiah, and Eliezer, the priests, did blow with the trumpets before the ark of God: and Obededom and Jehiah [were] doorkeepers for the ark.<br><a name="25">25</a>. So David, and the elders of Israel, and the captains over thousands, went to bring up the ark of the covenant of the LORD out of the house of Obededom with joy.<br><a name="26">26</a>  And it came to pass, when God helped the Levites that bare the ark of the covenant of the LORD, that they offered seven bullocks and seven rams.<br><a name="27">27</a>  And David [was] clothed with a robe of fine linen, and all the Levites that bare the ark, and the singers, and Chenaniah the master of the song with the singers: David also [had] upon him an ephod of linen.<br><a name="28">28</a>  Thus all Israel brought up the ark of the covenant of the LORD with shouting, and with sound of the cornet, and with trumpets, and with cymbals, making a noise with psalteries and harps.<br><a name="29">29</a>  And it came to pass, [as] the ark of the covenant of the LORD came to the city of David, that Michal the daughter of Saul looking out at a window saw king David dancing and playing: and she despised him in her heart.<br><br>Go to <a href="1chr16.htm#1">I Chronicles 16</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
