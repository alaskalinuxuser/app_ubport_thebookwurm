Romans   9<br> 1. I say the truth in Christ, I lie not, my conscience also bearing me witness in the Holy Ghost,<br><a name="2">2</a>  That I have great heaviness and continual sorrow in my heart.<br><a name="3">3</a>  For I could wish that myself were accursed from Christ for my brethren, my kinsmen according to the flesh:<br><a name="4">4</a>  Who are Israelites; to whom [pertaineth] the adoption, and the glory, and the covenants, and the giving of the law, and the service [of God], and the promises;<br><a name="5">5</a>  Whose [are] the fathers, and of whom as concerning the flesh Christ [came], who is over all, God blessed for ever. Amen.<br><a name="6">6</a>. Not as though the word of God hath taken none effect. For they [are] not all Israel, which are of Israel:<br><a name="7">7</a>  Neither, because they are the seed of Abraham, [are they] all children: but, In Isaac shall thy seed be called.<br><a name="8">8</a>  That is, They which are the children of the flesh, these [are] not the children of God: but the children of the promise are counted for the seed.<br><a name="9">9</a>  For this [is] the word of promise, At this time will I come, and Sara shall have a son.<br><a name="10">10</a>  And not only [this]; but when Rebecca also had conceived by one, [even] by our father Isaac;<br><a name="11">11</a>  (For [the children] being not yet born, neither having done any good or evil, that the purpose of God according to election might stand, not of works, but of him that calleth;)<br><a name="12">12</a>  It was said unto her, The elder shall serve the younger.<br><a name="13">13</a>  As it is written, Jacob have I loved, but Esau have I hated.<br><a name="14">14</a>. What shall we say then? [Is there] unrighteousness with God? God forbid.<br><a name="15">15</a>  For he saith to Moses, I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I will have compassion.<br><a name="16">16</a>  So then [it is] not of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth, but of God that sheweth mercy.<br><a name="17">17</a>  For the scripture saith unto Pharaoh, Even for this same purpose have I raised thee up, that I might shew my power in thee, and that my name might be declared throughout all the earth.<br><a name="18">18</a>  Therefore hath he mercy on whom he will [have mercy], and whom he will he hardeneth.<br><a name="19">19</a>  Thou wilt say then unto me, Why doth he yet find fault? For who hath resisted his will?<br><a name="20">20</a>  Nay but, O man, who art thou that repliest against God? Shall the thing formed say to him that formed [it], Why hast thou made me thus?<br><a name="21">21</a>  Hath not the potter power over the clay, of the same lump to make one vessel unto honour, and another unto dishonour?<br><a name="22">22</a>  [What] if God, willing to shew [his] wrath, and to make his power known, endured with much longsuffering the vessels of wrath fitted to destruction:<br><a name="23">23</a>  And that he might make known the riches of his glory on the vessels of mercy, which he had afore prepared unto glory,<br><a name="24">24</a>  Even us, whom he hath called, not of the Jews only, but also of the Gentiles?<br><a name="25">25</a>. As he saith also in Osee, I will call them my people, which were not my people; and her beloved, which was not beloved.<br><a name="26">26</a>  And it shall come to pass, [that] in the place where it was said unto them, Ye [are] not my people; there shall they be called the children of the living God.<br><a name="27">27</a>  Esaias also crieth concerning Israel, Though the number of the children of Israel be as the sand of the sea, a remnant shall be saved:<br><a name="28">28</a>  For he will finish the work, and cut [it] short in righteousness: because a short work will the Lord make upon the earth.<br><a name="29">29</a>  And as Esaias said before, Except the Lord of Sabaoth had left us a seed, we had been as Sodoma, and been made like unto Gomorrha.<br><a name="30">30</a>. What shall we say then? That the Gentiles, which followed not after righteousness, have attained to righteousness, even the righteousness which is of faith.<br><a name="31">31</a>  But Israel, which followed after the law of righteousness, hath not attained to the law of righteousness.<br><a name="32">32</a>  Wherefore? Because [they sought it] not by faith, but as it were by the works of the law. For they stumbled at that stumblingstone;<br><a name="33">33</a>  As it is written, Behold, I lay in Sion a stumblingstone and rock of offence: and whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed.<br><br>Go to <a href="rom10.htm#1">Romans 10</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
