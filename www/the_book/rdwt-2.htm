<dt><br>
The Scriptures divide time (by which is meant the entire period from the creation of Adam to the &quot;new heaven and a new earth&quot; of <a href="rev21.htm#1">Rev 21:1</a>) into seven unequal periods, usually called dispensations (<a href="eph3.htm#2">Eph 3:2</a>), although these periods are also called ages (<a href="eph2.htm#7">Eph 2:7</a>) and days, as in &quot;day of the Lord&quot;.<br><br>
These periods are marked off in Scripture by some change in God's method of dealing with mankind, or a portion of mankind, in respect of the two questions: [1] of sin, and [2] of man's responsibility. Each of the dispensations may be regarded as a new test of the natural man, and each ends in judgment, marking his utter failure in every dispensation. Five of these dispensations, or periods of time, have been fulfilled; we are living in the sixth, probably toward its close, and have before us the seventh, and last: the millennium.<br><br>
<dd>[<b>NOTE </b>(from the editor): <i>The changing order, from one dispensation to the next, demonstrates again and again man's sinful condition and need for salvation. However, contrary to a common misunderstanding, the various dispensations do not represent differing ways of salvation. As the last column in the accompanying chart shows, personal salvation has always been by Grace through Faith. In all ages, the basis of salvation is the death of Christ. The means of access to salvation is faith. The object of faith is God. The content of faith depends on the revelation given to that time. The essential elements, running through all ages, are: (1) the substitutionary blood sacrifice, and (2) the promised Seed, the Savior.</i>]<br>&nbsp;
<dt><a name="1"><b>1. Man Innocent-</b></a>
<dd>This dispensation extends from the creation of Adam in <a href="gen2.htm#7">Genesis 2:7</a> to the expulsion from Eden. Adam, created innocent and ignorant of good and evil, was placed in the garden of Eden with his wife, Eve, and put under responsibility to abstain from the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. The dispensation of innocence resulted in the first failure of man, and in its far-reaching effects, the most disastrous. It closed in judgment: &quot;So He drove out the man.&quot;<br>See <a href="gen1.htm#26">Gen 1:26</a>, <a href="gen2.htm#16">Gen 2:16,17</a>, <a href="gen3.htm#6">Gen 3:6</a>, <a href="gen3.htm#22">Gen 3:22-24</a>.<br>
<dt><a name="2"><b>2. Man under conscience-</b></a>
<dd>By the fall, Adam and Eve acquired and transmitted to the race the knowledge of good and evil. This gave conscience a basis for right moral judgment, and hence the race came under this measure of responsibility - to do good and eschew evil. The result of the dispensation of conscience, from Eden to the flood (while there was no institution of government and of law), was that &quot;all flesh had corrupted his way on the earth&quot;, that &quot;the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually&quot;, and God closed the second testing of the natural man with judgment: the flood. See <a href="gen3.htm#7">Gen 3:7,22</a>, <a href="gen6.htm#5">Gen 6:5,11-12</a>, <a href="gen7.htm#11">Gen 7:11-12,23</a>.<br>
<dt><a name="3"><b>3. Man in authority over the earth-</b></a>
<dd>Out of the fearful judgment of the flood, God saved eight persons, to whom, after the waters were assuaged, He gave the purified earth with ample power to govern it. This, Noah and his descendants were responsible to do. The dispensation of human government resulted, upon the plain of Shinar, in the impious attempt to become independent of God, and closed in judgment: the confusion of tongues. See <a href="gen9.htm#1">Gen 9:1,2</a>, <a href="gen11.htm#1">Gen 11:1-4</a>, <a href="gen11.htm#5">Gen 11:5-8</a>.<br>
<dt><a name="4"><b>4. Man under promise-</b></a>
<dd>Out of the dispersed decendants of the builders of Babel, God called one man, Abram, with whom He enters into covenant. Some of the promises to Abram and his descendants were purely gracious and unconditional. These either have been or will yet be literally fulfilled. Other promises were conditional upon the faithfulness and obedience of the Israelites. Every one of these conditions was violated, and the dispensation of promise resulted in the failure of Israel and closed in the judgment of bondage in Egypt.<br><br>
The book of Genesis, which opens with the sublime words, &quot;In the beginning God created&quot;, closes with &quot;in a coffin in Egypt&quot;.  See <a href="gen12.htm#1">Gen 12:1-3</a>, <a href="gen13.htm#14">Gen 13:14-17</a>, <a href="gen15.htm#5">Gen 15:5</a>, <a href="gen26.htm#3">Gen 26:3</a>, <a href="gen28.htm#12">Gen 28:12-13</a>, <a href="ex1.htm#13">Ex 1:13-14</a><br>
<dt><a name="5"><b>5. Man under the law-</b></a><dd>Again the grace of God came to the help of helpless man and redeemed the chosen people out of the hand of the oppressor. In the wilderness of Sinai, He proposed to them the covenant of the law. Instead of humbly pleading for a continued relation of grace, they presumptuously answered: &quot;All that the Lord hath spoken we will do.&quot; The history of Israel in the wilderness and in the land is one long record of flagrant, persistent violation of the law, and at last, after multiplied warnings, God closed the testing of man by law in judgment: first Israel, then Judah, were driven out of the land into a dispersion which still continues. A feeble remnant returned under Ezra and Nehemiah, of which, in due time, Christ came: &quot;Born of a woman - made under the law.&quot; Both Jews and Gentiles conspired to crucify Him. See <a href="ex19.htm#1">Ex 19:1-8</a>, <a href="2kin17.htm#1">2King 17:1-18</a>, <a href="2kin25.htm#1">2King 25:1-11</a>, <a href="act2.htm#22">Act 2:22-23</a>, <a href="act7.htm#51">Act 7:51-52</a>, <a href="rom3.htm#19">Rom 3:19-20</a>, <a href="rom10.htm#5">Rom 10:5</a>, <a href="gal3.htm#10">Gal 3:10</a>.<br>
<dt><a name="6"><b>6. Man under grace-</b></a>
<dd>The sacrificial death of the Lord Jesus Christ introduced the dispensation of pure grace, which means undeserved favor, or God <i>giving</i> righteousness, instead of God <i>requiring</i> righteousness, as under the law. Salvation, perfect and eternal, is now freely offered to Jew and Gentile upon the acknowledgment of sin (ie., repentance), with faith in Christ.<br><br>
   &quot;Jesus answered and said unto them, This is the work of God, that ye <i>believe</i> on Him whom He hath sent.&quot; (<a href="joh6.htm#29">Joh 6:29</a>)  &quot;Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that <i>believeth</i> on me <i>hath</i> everlasting life...&quot; (<a href="joh6.htm#47">Joh 6:47</a>)  &quot;Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that heareth my word, and <i>believeth</i> Him that sent me, <i>hath</i> eternal life, <i>and cometh not into judgment</i>, but hath passed out of death into life.&quot; (<a href="joh5.htm#24">Joh 5:24</a>, RV) &quot;My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me: and I give unto them eternal life; and they shall never perish.&quot; (<a href="joh10.htm#27">Joh 10:27-28</a>) &quot;For by grace have ye been saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the <i>gift</i> of God: not of works, that no man should glory.&quot; (<a href="eph2.htm#8">Eph 2:8-9</a>, RV)<br><br>
   The predicted result of this testing of man under grace is judgment upon an unbelieving world and an apostate church.  See <a href="luk17.htm#26">Luke 17:26-30</a>, <a href="luk18.htm#8">Luke 18:8</a>, <a href="2the2.htm#7">2The 2:7-12</a>, <a href="rev3.htm#15">Rev 3:15-16</a>.<br><br>
   The first event in the closing of this dispensation will be the descent of the Lord from heaven, when sleeping saints will be raised and, together with believers then living, caught up &quot;to meet the Lord in the air: and so shall we ever be with the Lord.&quot; (<a href="1the4.htm#16">1The 4:16-17</a>) <br><br>
<a name="T"></a>Then follows the brief period called &quot;the great tribulation&quot;. See <a href="jer30.htm#5">Jer 30:5-7</a>, <a href="dan12.htm#1">Dan 12:1</a>, <a href="zeph1.htm#15">Zeph 1:15-18</a>, <a href="mat24.htm#21">Mat 24:21-22</a>.<br>
[<b>Note </b>(from the editor)<b>: </b><i> Some teachers number the Tribulation as one of the dispensations, while combining the dispensations of Promise &amp; Law.   However, we see the Tribulation as a period of culmination, during which human civilization crumbles under the weight of the combined features of its ages long rejection of God.  The Lord has limited this period to a short 7 years, to prevent man's self-destruction.</i>]<br><br>
   After this, the personal return of the Lord to earth in power and great glory occurs, and the judgments which introduce the seventh, and last dispensation. See <a href="mat25.htm#31">Mat 25:31-46</a> and <a href="mat24.htm#29">Mat 24:29-30</a>.<br>
<dt><a name="7"><b>7. Man under the personal reign of Christ-</b></a>
<dd>After the purifying judgments which attend the personal return of Christ to the earth, He will reign over restored Israel and over the earth for one thousand years. This is the period commonly called &quot;the millennium&quot;. The seat of His power will be Jerusalem. The saints, including the saved of the dispensation of grace, namely the church, will be associated with Him in His glory.  See <a href="isa2.htm#1">Isa 2:1-4</a>, <a href="isa11.htm#1">Isa 11</a>, <a href="act15.htm#14">Acts 15:14-17</a>, <a href="rev19.htm#11">Rev 19:11-21</a>, <a href="rev20.htm#1">Rev 20:1-6</a>.<br><br>
But when Satan is &quot;loosed for a little season&quot;, he finds the natural heart as prone to evil as ever, and easily gathers the nations to battle against the Lord and His saints. This last dispensation closes, like all the others, in judgment. The great white throne is set, the wicked dead are raised and finally judged. And then come the &quot;new heaven and a new earth&quot;. Eternity is begun.  See <a href="rev20.htm#3">Rev 20:3,7-15</a>, [<a href="2pet3.htm#10">2Pet 3:10-14</a>], <a href="rev21.htm#1">Rev 21</a> and <a href="rev22.htm#1">22</a>.</dl>
