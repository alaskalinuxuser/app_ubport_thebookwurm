Psalms  91<br> 1. He that dwelleth in the secret place of the most High shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty.<br><a name="2">2</a>  I will say of the LORD, [He is] my refuge and my fortress: my God; in him will I trust.<br><a name="3">3</a>  Surely he shall deliver thee from the snare of the fowler, [and] from the noisome pestilence.<br><a name="4">4</a>  He shall cover thee with his feathers, and under his wings shalt thou trust: his truth [shall be thy] shield and buckler.<br><a name="5">5</a>  Thou shalt not be afraid for the terror by night; [nor] for the arrow [that] flieth by day;<br><a name="6">6</a>  [Nor] for the pestilence [that] walketh in darkness; [nor] for the destruction [that] wasteth at noonday.<br><a name="7">7</a>  A thousand shall fall at thy side, and ten thousand at thy right hand; [but] it shall not come nigh thee.<br><a name="8">8</a>  Only with thine eyes shalt thou behold and see the reward of the wicked.<br><a name="9">9</a>. Because thou hast made the LORD, [which is] my refuge, [even] the most High, thy habitation;<br><a name="10"> 10</a>  There shall no evil befall thee, neither shall any plague come nigh thy dwelling.<br><a name="11">11</a>  For he shall give his angels charge over thee, to keep thee in all thy ways.<br><a name="12">12</a>  They shall bear thee up in [their] hands, lest thou dash thy foot against a stone.<br><a name="13">13</a>  Thou shalt tread upon the lion and adder: the young lion and the dragon shalt thou trample under feet.<br><a name="14">14</a>  Because he hath set his love upon me, therefore will I deliver him: I will set him on high, because he hath known my name.<br><a name="15">15</a>  He shall call upon me, and I will answer him: I [will be] with him in trouble; I will deliver him, and honour him.<br><a name="16">16</a>  With long life will I satisfy him, and shew him my salvation.
