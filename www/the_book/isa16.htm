Isaiah  16<br>1. Send ye the lamb to the ruler of the land from Sela to the wilderness, unto the mount of the daughter of Zion.<br><a name="2">2</a>  For it shall be, [that], as a wandering bird cast out of the nest, [so] the daughters of Moab shall be at the fords of Arnon.<br><a name="3">3</a>  Take counsel, execute judgment; make thy shadow as the night in the midst of the noonday; hide the outcasts; bewray not him that wandereth.<br><a name="4">4</a>  Let mine outcasts dwell with thee, Moab; be thou a covert to them from the face of the spoiler: for the extortioner is at an end, the spoiler ceaseth, the oppressors are consumed out of the land.<br><a name="5">5</a>  And in mercy shall the throne be established: and he shall sit upon it in truth in the tabernacle of David, judging, and seeking judgment, and hasting righteousness.<br><a name="6">6</a>. We have heard of the pride of Moab; [he is] very proud: [even] of his haughtiness, and his pride, and his wrath: [but] his lies [shall] not [be] so.<br><a name="7">7</a>  Therefore shall Moab howl for Moab, every one shall howl: for the foundations of Kirhareseth shall ye mourn; surely [they are] stricken.<br><a name="8">8</a>  For the fields of Heshbon languish, [and] the vine of Sibmah: the lords of the heathen have broken down the principal plants thereof, they are come [even] unto Jazer, they wandered [through] the wilderness: her branches are stretched out, they are gone over the sea.<br><a name="9">9</a>  Therefore I will bewail with the weeping of Jazer the vine of Sibmah: I will water thee with my tears, O Heshbon, and Elealeh: for the shouting for thy summer fruits and for thy harvest is fallen.<br><a name="10">10</a>  And gladness is taken away, and joy out of the plentiful field; and in the vineyards there shall be no singing, neither shall there be shouting: the treaders shall tread out no wine in [their] presses; I have made [their vintage] shouting to cease.<br><a name="11">11</a>  Wherefore my bowels shall sound like an harp for Moab, and mine inward parts for Kirharesh.<br><a name="12">12</a>  And it shall come to pass, when it is seen that Moab is weary on the high place, that he shall come to his sanctuary to pray; but he shall not prevail.<br><a name="13">13</a>  This [is] the word that the LORD hath spoken concerning Moab since that time.<br><a name="14">14</a>  But now the LORD hath spoken, saying, Within three years, as the years of an hireling, and the glory of Moab shall be contemned, with all that great multitude; and the remnant [shall be] very small [and] feeble.<br><br>Go to <a href="isa17.htm#1">Isaiah 17</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
