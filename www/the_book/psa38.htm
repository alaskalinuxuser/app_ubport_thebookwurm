Psalms  38<br>1. A Psalm of David, to bring to remembrance. O LORD, rebuke me not in thy wrath: neither chasten me in thy hot displeasure.<br><a name="2">2</a>  For thine arrows stick fast in me, and thy hand presseth me sore.<br><a name="3">3</a>  [There is] no soundness in my flesh because of thine anger; neither [is there any] rest in my bones because of my sin.<br><a name="4">4</a>  For mine iniquities are gone over mine head: as an heavy burden they are too heavy for me.<br><a name="5">5</a>  My wounds stink [and] are corrupt because of my foolishness.<br><a name="6">6</a>  I am troubled; I am bowed down greatly; I go mourning all the day long.<br><a name="7">7</a>  For my loins are filled with a loathsome [disease]: and [there is] no soundness in my flesh.<br><a name="8">8</a>  I am feeble and sore broken: I have roared by reason of the disquietness of my heart.<br><a name="9">9</a>  Lord, all my desire [is] before thee; and my groaning is not hid from thee.<br><a name="10">10</a>  My heart panteth, my strength faileth me: as for the light of mine eyes, it also is gone from me.<br><a name="11">11</a>  My lovers and my friends stand aloof from my sore; and my kinsmen stand afar off.<br><a name="12">12</a>. They also that seek after my life lay snares [for me]: and they that seek my hurt speak mischievous things, and imagine deceits all the day long.<br><a name="13">13</a>  But I, as a deaf [man], heard not; and [I was] as a dumb man [that] openeth not his mouth.<br><a name="14">14</a>  Thus I was as a man that heareth not, and in whose mouth [are] no reproofs.<br><a name="15">15</a>  For in thee, O LORD, do I hope: thou wilt hear, O Lord my God.<br><a name="16">16</a>  For I said, [Hear me], lest [otherwise] they should rejoice over me: when my foot slippeth, they magnify [themselves] against me.<br><a name="17">17</a>  For I [am] ready to halt, and my sorrow [is] continually before me.<br><a name="18">18</a>  For I will declare mine iniquity; I will be sorry for my sin.<br><a name="19">19</a>  But mine enemies [are] lively, [and] they are strong: and they that hate me wrongfully are multiplied.<br><a name="20">20</a>  They also that render evil for good are mine adversaries; because I follow [the thing that] good [is].<br><a name="21">21</a>  Forsake me not, O LORD: O my God, be not far from me.<br><a name="22">22</a>  Make haste to help me, O Lord my salvation.<br><br>Go to <a href="psa39.htm#1">Psalm 39</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
