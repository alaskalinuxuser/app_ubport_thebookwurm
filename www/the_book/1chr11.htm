1Chronicles  11<br>1. Then all Israel gathered themselves to David unto Hebron, saying, Behold, we [are] thy bone and thy flesh.<br><a name="2">2</a>  And moreover in time past, even when Saul was king, thou [wast] he that leddest out and broughtest in Israel: and the LORD thy God said unto thee, Thou shalt feed my people Israel, and thou shalt be ruler over my people Israel.<br><a name="3">3</a>  Therefore came all the elders of Israel to the king to Hebron; and David made a covenant with them in Hebron before the LORD; and they anointed David king over Israel, according to the word of the LORD by Samuel.<br><a name="4">4</a>  And David and all Israel went to Jerusalem, which [is] Jebus; where the Jebusites [were], the inhabitants of the land.<br><a name="5">5</a>  And the inhabitants of Jebus said to David, Thou shalt not come hither. Nevertheless David took the castle of Zion, which [is] the city of David.<br><a name="6">6</a>  And David said, Whosoever smiteth the Jebusites first shall be chief and captain. So Joab the son of Zeruiah went first up, and was chief.<br><a name="7">7</a>  And David dwelt in the castle; therefore they called it the city of David.<br><a name="8">8</a>  And he built the city round about, even from Millo round about: and Joab repaired the rest of the city.<br><a name="9">9</a>  So David waxed greater and greater: for the LORD of hosts [was] with him.<br><a name="10">10</a>. These also [are] the chief of the mighty men whom David had, who strengthened themselves with him in his kingdom, [and] with all Israel, to make him king, according to the word of the LORD concerning Israel.<br><a name="11">11</a>  And this [is] the number of the mighty men whom David had; Jashobeam, an Hachmonite, the chief of the captains: he lifted up his spear against three hundred slain [by him] at one time.<br><a name="12">12</a>  And after him [was] Eleazar the son of Dodo, the Ahohite, who [was one] of the three mighties.<br><a name="13">13</a>  He was with David at Pasdammim, and there the Philistines were gathered together to battle, where was a parcel of ground full of barley; and the people fled from before the Philistines.<br><a name="14">14</a>  And they set themselves in the midst of [that] parcel, and delivered it, and slew the Philistines; and the LORD saved [them] by a great deliverance.<br><a name="15">15</a>  Now three of the thirty captains went down to the rock to David, into the cave of Adullam; and the host of the Philistines encamped in the valley of Rephaim.<br><a name="16">16</a>  And David [was] then in the hold, and the Philistines' garrison [was] then at Bethlehem.<br><a name="17">17</a>  And David longed, and said, Oh that one would give me drink of the water of the well of Bethlehem, that [is] at the gate!<br><a name="18">18</a>  And the three brake through the host of the Philistines, and drew water out of the well of Bethlehem, that [was] by the gate, and took [it], and brought [it] to David: but David would not drink [of] it, but poured it out to the LORD,<br><a name="19">19</a>  And said, My God forbid it me, that I should do this thing: shall I drink the blood of these men that have put their lives in jeopardy? for with [the jeopardy of] their lives they brought it. Therefore he would not drink it. These things did these three mightiest.<br><a name="20">20</a>  And Abishai the brother of Joab, he was chief of the three: for lifting up his spear against three hundred, he slew [them], and had a name among the three.<br><a name="21">21</a>  Of the three, he was more honourable than the two; for he was their captain: howbeit he attained not to the [first] three.<br><a name="22">22</a>  Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, the son of a valiant man of Kabzeel, who had done many acts; he slew two lionlike men of Moab: also he went down and slew a lion in a pit in a snowy day.<br><a name="23">23</a>  And he slew an Egyptian, a man of [great] stature, five cubits high; and in the Egyptian's hand [was] a spear like a weaver's beam; and he went down to him with a staff, and plucked the spear out of the Egyptian's hand, and slew him with his own spear.<br><a name="24">24</a>  These [things] did Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and had the name among the three mighties.<br><a name="25">25</a>  Behold, he was honourable among the thirty, but attained not to the [first] three: and David set him over his guard.<br><a name="26">26</a>  Also the valiant men of the armies [were], Asahel the brother of Joab, Elhanan the son of Dodo of Bethlehem,<br><a name="27">27</a>  Shammoth the Harorite, Helez the Pelonite,<br><a name="28">28</a>  Ira the son of Ikkesh the Tekoite, Abiezer the Antothite,<br><a name="29">29</a>  Sibbecai the Hushathite, Ilai the Ahohite,<br><a name="30">30</a>  Maharai the Netophathite, Heled the son of Baanah the Netophathite,<br><a name="31">31</a>  Ithai the son of Ribai of Gibeah, [that pertained] to the children of Benjamin, Benaiah the Pirathonite,<br><a name="32">32</a>  Hurai of the brooks of Gaash, Abiel the Arbathite,<br><a name="33">33</a>  Azmaveth the Baharumite, Eliahba the Shaalbonite,<br><a name="34">34</a>  The sons of Hashem the Gizonite, Jonathan the son of Shage the Hararite,<br><a name="35">35</a>  Ahiam the son of Sacar the Hararite, Eliphal the son of Ur,<br><a name="36">36</a>  Hepher the Mecherathite, Ahijah the Pelonite,<br><a name="37">37</a>  Hezro the Carmelite, Naarai the son of Ezbai,<br><a name="38">38</a>  Joel the brother of Nathan, Mibhar the son of Haggeri,<br><a name="39">39</a>  Zelek the Ammonite, Naharai the Berothite, the armourbearer of Joab the son of Zeruiah,<br><a name="40">40</a>  Ira the Ithrite, Gareb the Ithrite,<br><a name="41">41</a>  Uriah the Hittite, Zabad the son of Ahlai,<br><a name="42">42</a>  Adina the son of Shiza the Reubenite, a captain of the Reubenites, and thirty with him,<br><a name="43">43</a>  Hanan the son of Maachah, and Joshaphat the Mithnite,<br><a name="44">44</a>  Uzzia the Ashterathite, Shama and Jehiel the sons of Hothan the Aroerite,<br><a name="45">45</a>  Jediael the son of Shimri, and Joha his brother, the Tizite,<br><a name="46">46</a>  Eliel the Mahavite, and Jeribai, and Joshaviah, the sons of Elnaam, and Ithmah the Moabite,<br><a name="47">47</a>  Eliel, and Obed, and Jasiel the Mesobaite.<br><br>Go to <a href="1chr12.htm#1">I Chronicles 12</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
