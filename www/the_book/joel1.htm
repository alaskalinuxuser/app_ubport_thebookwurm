Joel   1<br>1. The word of the LORD that came to Joel the son of Pethuel.<br><a name="2">2</a>  Hear this, ye old men, and give ear, all ye inhabitants of the land. Hath this been in your days, or even in the days of your fathers?<br><a name="3">3</a>  Tell ye your children of it, and [let] your children [tell] their children, and their children another generation.<br><a name="4">4</a>  That which the palmerworm hath left hath the locust eaten; and that which the locust hath left hath the cankerworm eaten; and that which the cankerworm hath left hath the caterpiller eaten.<br><a name="5">5</a>  Awake, ye drunkards, and weep; and howl, all ye drinkers of wine, because of the new wine; for it is cut off from your mouth.<br><a name="6">6</a>  For a nation is come up upon my land, strong, and without number, whose teeth [are] the teeth of a lion, and he hath the cheek teeth of a great lion.<br><a name="7">7</a>  He hath laid my vine waste, and barked my fig tree: he hath made it clean bare, and cast [it] away; the branches thereof are made white.<br><a name="8">8</a>. Lament like a virgin girded with sackcloth for the husband of her youth.<br><a name="9">9</a>  The meat offering and the drink offering is cut off from the house of the LORD; the priests, the LORD'S ministers, mourn.<br><a name="10">10</a>  The field is wasted, the land mourneth; for the corn is wasted: the new wine is dried up, the oil languisheth.<br><a name="11">11</a>  Be ye ashamed, O ye husbandmen; howl, O ye vinedressers, for the wheat and for the barley; because the harvest of the field is perished.<br><a name="12">12</a>  The vine is dried up, and the fig tree languisheth; the pomegranate tree, the palm tree also, and the apple tree, [even] all the trees of the field, are withered: because joy is withered away from the sons of men.<br><a name="13">13</a>  Gird yourselves, and lament, ye priests: howl, ye ministers of the altar: come, lie all night in sackcloth, ye ministers of my God: for the meat offering and the drink offering is withholden from the house of your God.<br><a name="14">14</a>. Sanctify ye a fast, call a solemn assembly, gather the elders [and] all the inhabitants of the land [into] the house of the LORD your God, and cry unto the LORD,<br><a name="15">15</a>  Alas for the day! for the day of the LORD [is] at hand, and as a destruction from the Almighty shall it come.<br><a name="16">16</a>  Is not the meat cut off before our eyes, [yea], joy and gladness from the house of our God?<br><a name="17">17</a>  The seed is rotten under their clods, the garners are laid desolate, the barns are broken down; for the corn is withered.<br><a name="18">18</a>  How do the beasts groan! the herds of cattle are perplexed, because they have no pasture; yea, the flocks of sheep are made desolate.<br><a name="19">19</a>  O LORD, to thee will I cry: for the fire hath devoured the pastures of the wilderness, and the flame hath burned all the trees of the field.<br><a name="20">20</a>  The beasts of the field cry also unto thee: for the rivers of waters are dried up, and the fire hath devoured the pastures of the wilderness.<br><br>Go to <a href="joel2.htm#1">Joel 2</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
