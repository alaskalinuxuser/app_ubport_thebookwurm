Ephesians   5<br> 1. Be ye therefore followers of God, as dear children;<br><a name="2">2</a>  And walk in love, as Christ also hath loved us, and hath given himself for us an offering and a sacrifice to God for a sweetsmelling savour.<br><a name="3">3</a>. But fornication, and all uncleanness, or covetousness, let it not be once named among you, as becometh saints;<br><a name="4">4</a>  Neither filthiness, nor foolish talking, nor jesting, which are not convenient: but rather giving of thanks.<br><a name="5">5</a>  For this ye know, that no whoremonger, nor unclean person, nor covetous man, who is an idolater, hath any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God.<br><a name="6">6</a>  Let no man deceive you with vain words: for because of these things cometh the wrath of God upon the children of disobedience.<br><a name="7">7</a>  Be not ye therefore partakers with them.<br><a name="8">8</a>  For ye were sometimes darkness, but now [are ye] light in the Lord: walk as children of light:<br><a name="9">9</a>  (For the fruit of the Spirit [is] in all goodness and righteousness and truth;)<br><a name="10">10</a>  Proving what is acceptable unto the Lord.<br><a name="11">11</a>  And have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather reprove [them].<br><a name="12">12</a>  For it is a shame even to speak of those things which are done of them in secret.<br><a name="13">13</a>  But all things that are reproved are made manifest by the light: for whatsoever doth make manifest is light.<br><a name="14">14</a>  Wherefore he saith, Awake thou that sleepest, and arise from the dead, and Christ shall give thee light.<br><a name="15">15</a>  See then that ye walk circumspectly, not as fools, but as wise,<br><a name="16">16</a>  Redeeming the time, because the days are evil.<br><a name="17">17</a>  Wherefore be ye not unwise, but understanding what the will of the Lord [is].<br><a name="18">18</a>  And be not drunk with wine, wherein is excess; but be filled with the Spirit;<br><a name="19">19</a>  Speaking to yourselves in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and making melody in your heart to the Lord;<br><a name="20">20</a>  Giving thanks always for all things unto God and the Father in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ;<br><a name="21">21</a>. Submitting yourselves one to another in the fear of God.<br><a name="22">22</a>  Wives, submit yourselves unto your own husbands, as unto the Lord.<br><a name="23">23</a>  For the husband is the head of the wife, even as Christ is the head of the church: and he is the saviour of the body.<br><a name="24">24</a>  Therefore as the church is subject unto Christ, so [let] the wives [be] to their own husbands in every thing.<br><a name="25">25</a>  Husbands, love your wives, even as Christ also loved the church, and gave himself for it;<br><a name="26">26</a>  That he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of water by the word,<br><a name="27">27</a>  That he might present it to himself a glorious church, not having spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing; but that it should be holy and without blemish.<br><a name="28">28</a>  So ought men to love their wives as their own bodies. He that loveth his wife loveth himself.<br><a name="29">29</a>  For no man ever yet hated his own flesh; but nourisheth and cherisheth it, even as the Lord the church:<br><a name="30">30</a>  For we are members of his body, of his flesh, and of his bones.<br><a name="31">31</a>  For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother, and shall be joined unto his wife, and they two shall be one flesh.<br><a name="32">32</a>  This is a great mystery: but I speak concerning Christ and the church.<br><a name="33">33</a>  Nevertheless let every one of you in particular so love his wife even as himself; and the wife [see] that she reverence [her] husband.<br><br>Go to <A HREF="eph6.htm#1">Ephesians 6</A><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
