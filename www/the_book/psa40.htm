Psalms  40<br> 1. To the chief Musician, A Psalm of David. I waited patiently for the LORD; and he inclined unto me, and heard my cry.<br><a name="2">2</a>  He brought me up also out of an horrible pit, out of the miry clay, and set my feet upon a rock, [and] established my goings.<br><a name="3">3</a>  And he hath put a new song in my mouth, [even] praise unto our God: many shall see [it], and fear, and shall trust in the LORD.<br><a name="4">4</a>  Blessed [is] that man that maketh the LORD his trust, and respecteth not the proud, nor such as turn aside to lies.<br><a name="5">5</a>  Many, O LORD my God, [are] thy wonderful works [which] thou hast done, and thy thoughts [which are] to us-ward: they cannot be reckoned up in order unto thee: [if] I would declare and speak [of them], they are more than can be numbered.<br><a name="6">6</a>. Sacrifice and offering thou didst not desire; mine ears hast thou opened: burnt offering and sin offering hast thou not required.<br><a name="7">7</a>  Then said I, Lo, I come: in the volume of the book [it is] written of me,<br><a name="8">8</a>  I delight to do thy will, O my God: yea, thy law [is] within my heart.<br><a name="9">9</a>  I have preached righteousness in the great congregation: lo, I have not refrained my lips, O LORD, thou knowest.<br><a name="10">10</a>  I have not hid thy righteousness within my heart; I have declared thy faithfulness and thy salvation: I have not concealed thy lovingkindness and thy truth from the great congregation.<br><a name="11">11</a>. Withhold not thou thy tender mercies from me, O LORD: let thy lovingkindness and thy truth continually preserve me.<br><a name="12">12</a>  For innumerable evils have compassed me about: mine iniquities have taken hold upon me, so that I am not able to look up; they are more than the hairs of mine head: therefore my heart faileth me.<br><a name="13">13</a>  Be pleased, O LORD, to deliver me: O LORD, make haste to help me.<br><a name="14">14</a>  Let them be ashamed and confounded together that seek after my soul to destroy it; let them be driven backward and put to shame that wish me evil.<br><a name="15">15</a>  Let them be desolate for a reward of their shame that say unto me, Aha, aha.<br><a name="16">16</a>  Let all those that seek thee rejoice and be glad in thee: let such as love thy salvation say continually, The LORD be magnified.<br><a name="17">17</a>  But I [am] poor and needy; [yet] the Lord thinketh upon me: thou [art] my help and my deliverer; make no tarrying, O my God.<br><br>Go to <a href="psa41.htm#1">Psalm 41</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
