<dt><i><b>45:1 To the chief Musician upon Shoshannim,</b></i></dt><dl>
<dt>Shoshannim = lilies; ie., in spring time, the season of the Passover.</dl>
<dt><i><b>for the sons of Korah</b></i>{who were priests ministering in music}<i><b>, Maschil</b></i> {ie., instruction},<br><i><b>A Song of loves.</b></i></dt><dl>
<dt>loves - the plural indicates intensity and excellency.<dd>Therefore, &quot;A song of supreme love.&quot; [GWms]</dl>
<dt><i><b>My heart is inditing a good matter:<br>
I speak of the things which I have made touching the king:<br>
my tongue [is] the pen of a ready writer.</b></i></dt><dl>
<dt>is inditing- &quot;stirs with&quot;, &quot;overflows with&quot;
<dt>matter- an utterance, speech.
<dd>The Talmud renders this: &quot;My heart was stirred to compose this song by a spirit of prophecy.&quot;
<dt>a ready {ie., skilled} writer- not the psalmist, but the One who moved his heart to speak His Word.
<dd>cp. <a href="job32.htm#18">Job 32:18-20</a>; <a href="2pet1.htm#21">2Pet 1:21</a>
<dt>the king- some think the psalm commemorates one of Solomon's marriages.
<dd>(cp. the psalm title &quot;Upon Lilies&quot; with <a href="luk12.htm#27">Luk 12:27</a>)
<dd>But the glory of this King surpasses that of earthly kings. He is in fact the Deity (<a href="psa45.htm#6" target="lwr_lt">v.6</a>).
<dd>He is the Lord Jesus Christ who comes to conquer His enemies &amp; to claim His Bride. cp. <a href="psa24.htm#7">Psa 24:7-10</a></dl>
<dt><i><b>45:2 Thou art fairer than the children of men:</b></i></dt><dl>
<dt>fairer- lit., beautiful. The word is doubled: &quot;Beautiful, Beautiful art thou.&quot; [CHS]
<dd>Words strain to describe Him. When He comes, we will see Him as He is.
<dd>But, even now, though veiled, the Bride's eyes are filled with her Beloved.

<dd>cp. the garment of the priests: <a href="ex28.htm#39">Ex 28:39</a></dl><dt>
<i><b>the virgins her companions that follow her shall be brought unto thee.</b></i></dt><dl>
<dt>companions- ie., attendants.
<dt>virgins - ie., 'separated ones' (of feminine gender). -- Who are these?
<dd>Note that they 'follow' the Bride. &quot;Follow&quot; may mean &quot;to come after&quot; (in time).
<dd>While the Church will be taken out of the world, in the Rapture, at the end of the Church Age (the Age of Grace), many more people will come to faith in Christ during the subsequent Great Tribulation period. At the end of the Tribulation, Christ will return to judge the earth. His Bride (the true Church) will return with Him. The Marriage Supper of the Lamb will take place on the earth, as Christ establishes His Millennial Kingdom.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, these 'virgins' may include the 144,000 specially sealed Jewish witnesses and-or all who separated themselves unto the Lord, during the Great Tribulation. cp. <a href="rev6.htm#9">Rev 6:9-11</a>; <a href="rev14.htm#1">Rev 14:1-4</a><br>(For more about the Marriage Supper of the Lamb, see the <a href="rev19an.htm#supper" target="lwr_lt">Notes at Rev 19:7-9</a>.)</dl>

<dt><i><b>45:16 Instead of thy fathers shall be thy children,<br>

<dt>The King's inheritance is not limited to human ancestry (eg., the Davidic line),
