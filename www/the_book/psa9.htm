Psalms   9<br> 1. To the chief Musician upon Muthlabben, A Psalm of David. I will praise [thee], O LORD, with my whole heart; I will shew forth all thy marvellous works.<br><a name="2">2</a>  I will be glad and rejoice in thee: I will sing praise to thy name, O thou most High.<br><a name="3">3</a>  When mine enemies are turned back, they shall fall and perish at thy presence.<br><a name="4">4</a>  For thou hast maintained my right and my cause; thou satest in the throne judging right.<br><a name="5">5</a>  Thou hast rebuked the heathen, thou hast destroyed the wicked, thou hast put out their name for ever and ever.<br><a name="6">6</a>  O thou enemy, destructions are come to a perpetual end: and thou hast destroyed cities; their memorial is perished with them.<br><a name="7">7</a>  But the LORD shall endure for ever: he hath prepared his throne for judgment.<br><a name="8">8</a>  And he shall judge the world in righteousness, he shall minister judgment to the people in uprightness.<br><a name="9">9</a>  The LORD also will be a refuge for the oppressed, a refuge in times of trouble.<br><a name="10">10</a>  And they that know thy name will put their trust in thee: for thou, LORD, hast not forsaken them that seek thee.<br><a name="11">11</a>. Sing praises to the LORD, which dwelleth in Zion: declare among the people his doings.<br><a name="12">12</a>  When he maketh inquisition for blood, he remembereth them: he forgetteth not the cry of the humble.<br><a name="13">13</a>  Have mercy upon me, O LORD; consider my trouble [which I suffer] of them that hate me, thou that liftest me up from the gates of death:<br><a name="14">14</a>  That I may shew forth all thy praise in the gates of the daughter of Zion: I will rejoice in thy salvation.<br><a name="15">15</a>  The heathen are sunk down in the pit [that] they made: in the net which they hid is their own foot taken.<br><a name="16">16</a>  The LORD is known [by] the judgment [which] he executeth: the wicked is snared in the work of his own hands. Higgaion. Selah.<br><a name="17">17</a>  The wicked shall be turned into hell, [and] all the nations that forget God.<br><a name="18">18</a>  For the needy shall not alway be forgotten: the expectation of the poor shall [not] perish for ever.<br><a name="19">19</a>  Arise, O LORD; let not man prevail: let the heathen be judged in thy sight.<br><a name="20">20</a>  Put them in fear, O LORD: [that] the nations may know themselves [to be but] men.
