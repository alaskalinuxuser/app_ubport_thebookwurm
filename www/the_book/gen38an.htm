<dt>This account of Judah's manner of life stands in stark contrast to Joseph's righteousness.
<dd>It may be considered as a sample of the sinful character of the other sons of Israel.<br>This account demonstrates the greatness of God's Grace, which is greater than all our sin.<dt><dt>
<b><i>38:1 And it came to pass at that time, that Judah went down from his brethren,<br>and turned in to a certain Adullamite, whose name [was] Hirah.<br>
38:2 And Judah saw there a daughter of a certain Canaanite, whose name [was] Shuah;<br>and he took her, and went in unto her.<br>
38:3 And she conceived, and bare a son; and he called his name Er.<br>
38:4 And she conceived again, and bare a son; and she called his name Onan.<br>
38:5 And she yet again conceived, and bare a son; and called his name Shelah:<br>and he was at Chezib, when she bare him.<br>
38:6 And Judah took a wife for Er his firstborn, whose name [was] Tamar.<br>
38:7 And Er, Judah's firstborn, was wicked in the sight of the LORD; and the LORD slew him.<br>
38:8 And Judah said unto Onan, Go in unto thy brother's wife, and marry her,<br>and raise up seed to thy brother.<br>
38:9 And Onan knew that the seed should not be his;<br>and it came to pass, when he went in unto his brother's wife,<br>that he spilled [it] on the ground, lest that he should give seed to his brother.<br>
38:10 And the thing which he did displeased the LORD: wherefore he slew him also.</b></i>
<dd>{'displeased the LORD' is literally: 'was evil in the eyes of the LORD.'}
<dt><b><i>38:11 Then said Judah to Tamar his daughter in law,<br>Remain a widow at thy father's house, till Shelah my son be grown:<br>for he said, Lest peradventure he die also, as his brethren [did].<br>And Tamar went and dwelt in her father's house.<br>
38:12 And in process of time the daughter of Shuah Judah's wife died; and Judah was comforted,<br>and went up unto his sheepshearers to Timnath, he and his friend Hirah the Adullamite.<br>
38:13 And it was told Tamar, saying,<br>Behold thy father in law goeth up to Timnath to shear his sheep.<br>
38:14 And she put her widow's garments off from her, and covered her with a vail, and wrapped herself,<br>and sat in an open place, which [is] by the way to Timnath;<br>for she saw that Shelah was grown, and she was not given unto him to wife.<br>
38:15 When Judah saw her, he thought her [to be] an harlot; because she had covered her face.<br>
38:16 And he turned unto her by the way, and said, Go to, I pray thee, let me come in unto thee;<br>(for he knew not that she [was] his daughter in law.)<br>And she said, What wilt thou give me, that thou mayest come in unto me?<br>
38:17 And he said, I will send [thee] a kid from the flock.<br>And she said, Wilt thou give [me] a pledge, till thou send [it]?<br>
38:18 And he said, What pledge shall I give thee?<br>And she said, Thy signet, and thy bracelets, and thy staff that [is] in thine hand.<br>And he gave [it] her, and came in unto her, and she conceived by him.<br>
38:19 And she arose, and went away,<br>and laid by her vail from her, and put on the garments of her widowhood.<br>
38:20 And Judah sent the kid by the hand of his friend the Adullamite,<br>to receive [his] pledge from the woman's hand: but he found her not.<br>
38:21 Then he asked the men of that place, saying,<br>Where [is] the harlot, that [was] openly by the way side?<br>And they said, There was no harlot in this [place].<br>
38:22 And he returned to Judah, and said, I cannot find her;<br>and also the men of the place said, [that] there was no harlot in this [place].<br>
38:23 And Judah said, Let her take [it] to her, lest we be shamed:<br>behold, I sent this kid, and thou hast not found her.</i></b></dt><dl>
<dt>Judah was a sinful man. (No doubt, his life is typical of his other brothers.)<ul>
<li>Judah sinned in marrying a Canaanite woman. <a href="gen38.htm#1" target="lwr_lt">v.1,2</a>; cp. <a href="gen24.htm#3">24:3</a>; <a href="gen26.htm#34">26:34,35</a>; <a href="gen27.htm#46">27:46</a>; <a href="gen28.htm#1">28:1</a><br>
<li>Judah was comfortable with Canaanite culture.<dd>
Whereas Jacob had entered into commercial dealings with the Canaanites, to his hurt (<a href="gen33.htm#18">33:18,19</a>, and the subsequent rape of Dinah, and the vengeful violence of his sons), Judah entered into business partnership &amp; friendship with a Canaanite. <a href="gen38.htm#12" target="lwr_lt">v.12</a>; cp. <a href="2cor6.htm#14">2Cor 6:14</a></dd><dd>
It is evident from this chapter, that the sons of Israel were acting like the Canaanites.</dd><dd>
God would soon remove them from the influence of Canaan to relative isolation of Goshen in Egypt, until the iniquity of the Canaanites was full (cp. <a href="gen15.htm#13">Gen 15:13-16</a>).</dd>
<li>Judah's sons, Er and Onan, were so wicked that the Lord slew them.<dd>
It was not a sin for a man to take the wife of a deceased brother. This was actually required by the custom of the day, which was later incorporated into the Mosaic Law (cp. <a href="deu25.htm#5">Deu 25:5,6</a>; <a href="mat22.htm#23">Mat 22:23-33</a>). Er was slain because of unnamed wickedness. Onan was slain because he took selfish pleasure in refusing to fulfill his responsibility to his brother's wife.</dd>
<li>Judah sinned by refusing his responsibility to his daughter-in-law, through his remaining son. 
<li>Judah was sexually promiscuous, thinking nothing of propositioning a harlot.<dd>
He had surrendered symbols of his honor to the harlot. (<a href="gen38.htm#18" target="lwr_lt">v.18</a>; cp. <a href="gen41.htm#42">41:42</a>)</dd><dd>Judah was not ashamed to make his gentile friend aware of, and a facilitator of, his sin. <a href="gen38.htm#20" target="lwr_lt">v.20</a></dd><dd>
Having made an honest attempt to pay his bill, he considered himself honorable. <a href="gen38.htm#23" target="lwr_lt">v.23</a></dd>
<li>Judah would have exercised justice by a double standard.<dd>
Sin held no consequence for him, but was punishable by death for his daughter-in-law. <a href="gen38.htm#24" target="lwr_lt">v.24</a></dd></ul>

<b><i>38:24 And it came to pass about three months after, that it was told Judah, saying,<br>Tamar thy daughter in law hath played the harlot;<br>and also, behold, she [is] with child by whoredom.<br>And Judah said, Bring her forth, and let her be burnt.<br>
38:25 When she [was] brought forth, she sent to her father in law,<br>saying, By the man, whose these [are, am] I with child:<br>and she said, Discern, I pray thee, whose [are] these, the signet, and bracelets, and staff.<br>
38:26 And Judah acknowledged [them], and said,<br>
She hath been more righteous than I; because that I gave her not to Shelah my son.<br>And he knew her again no more.<br>
38:27 And it came to pass in the time of her travail, that, behold, twins [were] in her womb.<br>
38:28 And it came to pass, when she travailed, that [the one] put out [his] hand:<br>and the midwife took and bound upon his hand a scarlet thread, saying, This came out first.<br>
38:29 And it came to pass, as he drew back his hand, that, behold, his brother came out:<br>and she said, How hast thou broken forth? [this] breach [be] upon thee:<br>therefore his name was called Pharez </b></i>{ie., a breach, a breaking forth}<i><b>.<br>
38:30 And afterward came out his brother, that had the scarlet thread upon his hand:<br>and his name was called Zarah.</i></b></dt><dl>
<dt>God's grace stands out here, against the dark background of Judah's sinful condition.
<dd>Judah and his sons were under the judgment of God (eg., <a href="gen38.htm#7" target="lwr_lt">v.7,10</a>), and in desperate need of salvation from their sin.<br>
God would provide the Savior, through this line, though they were totally undeserving.<br>cp. <a href="heb7.htm#14">Heb 7:14</a>; <a href="mat1.htm#1">Mat 1:1-3</a> (Judah and Pharez are also listed in <a href="luk3.htm#33">Luk 3:33,34</a>. The genealogy, in Matthew, is through Joseph, the stepfather of Jesus. The one, in Luke, is through Mary, His mother.)
<dt>Zarah was Tamar's firstborn (according to the scarlet thread). <dd>But God chose the second son, Pharez {'a breaking forth'}. cp. <a href="1cor15.htm#46">1Cor 15:46</a><br>The Savior, who would come through him, would be the 'way of escape' from man's bondage to sin and death. cp. <a href="1cor15.htm#46">1Cor 15:46-57</a>
