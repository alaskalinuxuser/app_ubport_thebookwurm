Psalms 147<br>1. Praise ye the LORD: for [it is] good to sing praises unto our God; for [it is] pleasant; [and] praise is comely.<br><a name="2">2</a>  The LORD doth build up Jerusalem: he gathereth together the outcasts of Israel.<br><a name="3">3</a>  He healeth the broken in heart, and bindeth up their wounds.<br><a name="4">4</a>  He telleth the number of the stars; he calleth them all by [their] names.<br><a name="5">5</a>  Great [is] our Lord, and of great power: his understanding [is] infinite.<br><a name="6">6</a>  The LORD lifteth up the meek: he casteth the wicked down to the ground.<br><a name="7">7</a>  Sing unto the LORD with thanksgiving; sing praise upon the harp unto our God:<br><a name="8">8</a>  Who covereth the heaven with clouds, who prepareth rain for the earth, who maketh grass to grow upon the mountains.<br><a name="9">9</a>  He giveth to the beast his food, [and] to the young ravens which cry.<br><a name="10">10</a>  He delighteth not in the strength of the horse: he taketh not pleasure in the legs of a man.<br><a name="11">11</a>  The LORD taketh pleasure in them that fear him, in those that hope in his mercy.<br><a name="12">12</a>. Praise the LORD, O Jerusalem; praise thy God, O Zion.<br><a name="13">13</a>  For he hath strengthened the bars of thy gates; he hath blessed thy children within thee.<br><a name="14">14</a>  He maketh peace [in] thy borders, [and] filleth thee with the finest of the wheat.<br><a name="15">15</a>  He sendeth forth his commandment [upon] earth: his word runneth very swiftly.<br><a name="16">16</a>  He giveth snow like wool: he scattereth the hoarfrost like ashes.<br><a name="17">17</a>  He casteth forth his ice like morsels: who can stand before his cold?<br><a name="18">18</a>  He sendeth out his word, and melteth them: he causeth his wind to blow, [and] the waters flow.<br><a name="19">19</a>  He sheweth his word unto Jacob, his statutes and his judgments unto Israel.<br><a name="20">20</a>  He hath not dealt so with any nation: and [as for his] judgments, they have not known them.
