1Corinthians   3<br>1. And I, brethren, could not speak unto you as unto spiritual, but as unto carnal, [even] as unto babes in Christ.<br><a name="2">2</a>  I have fed you with milk, and not with meat: for hitherto ye were not able [to bear it], neither yet now are ye able.<br><a name="3">3</a>  For ye are yet carnal: for whereas [there is] among you envying, and strife, and divisions, are ye not carnal, and walk as men?<br><a name="4">4</a>  For while one saith, I am of Paul; and another, I [am] of Apollos; are ye not carnal?<br><a name="5">5</a>. Who then is Paul, and who [is] Apollos, but ministers by whom ye believed, even as the Lord gave to every man?<br><a name="6">6</a>  I have planted, Apollos watered; but God gave the increase.<br><a name="7">7</a>  So then neither is he that planteth any thing, neither he that watereth; but God that giveth the increase.<br><a name="8">8</a>  Now he that planteth and he that watereth are one: and every man shall receive his own reward according to his own labour.<br><a name="9">9</a>  For we are labourers together with God: ye are God's husbandry, [ye are] God's building.<br><a name="10">10</a>  According to the grace of God which is given unto me, as a wise masterbuilder, I have laid the foundation, and another buildeth thereon. But let every man take heed how he buildeth thereupon.<br><a name="11">11</a>. For other foundation can no man lay than that is laid, which is Jesus Christ.<br><a name="12">12</a>  Now if any man build upon this foundation gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, stubble;<br><a name="13">13</a>  Every man's work shall be made manifest: for the day shall declare it, because it shall be revealed by fire; and the fire shall try every man's work of what sort it is.<br><a name="14">14</a>  If any man's work abide which he hath built thereupon, he shall receive a reward.<br><a name="15">15</a>  If any man's work shall be burned, he shall suffer loss: but he himself shall be saved; yet so as by fire.<br><a name="16">16</a>. Know ye not that ye are the temple of God, and [that] the Spirit of God dwelleth in you?<br><a name="17">17</a>  If any man defile the temple of God, him shall God destroy; for the temple of God is holy, which [temple] ye are.<br><a name="18">18</a>. Let no man deceive himself. If any man among you seemeth to be wise in this world, let him become a fool, that he may be wise.<br><a name="19">19</a>  For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God. For it is written, He taketh the wise in their own craftiness.<br><a name="20">20</a>  And again, The Lord knoweth the thoughts of the wise, that they are vain.<br><a name="21">21</a>. Therefore let no man glory in men. For all things are yours;<br><a name="22">22</a>  Whether Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas, or the world, or life, or death, or things present, or things to come; all are yours;<br><a name="23">23</a>  And ye are Christ's; and Christ [is] God's.<br><br>Go to <a href="1cor4.htm#1">I Corinthians 4</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
