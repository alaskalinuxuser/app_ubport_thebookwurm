Psalms   1<br> 1. Blessed [is] the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly, nor standeth in the way of sinners, nor sitteth in the seat of the scornful.<br><a name="2">2</a>  But his delight [is] in the law of the LORD; and in his law doth he meditate day and night.<br><a name="3">3</a>  And he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water, that bringeth forth his fruit in his season; his leaf also shall not wither; and whatsoever he doeth shall prosper.<br><a name="4">4</a>. The ungodly [are] not so: but [are] like the chaff which the wind driveth away.<br><a name="5">5</a>  Therefore the ungodly shall not stand in the judgment, nor sinners in the congregation of the righteous.<br><a name="6">6</a>  For the LORD knoweth the way of the righteous: but the way of the ungodly shall perish.<br><br>Go to <a href="psa2.htm#1">Psalm 2</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
