1Corinthians   4<br> 1. Let a man so account of us, as of the ministers of Christ, and stewards of the mysteries of God.<br><a name="2">2</a>  Moreover it is required in stewards, that a man be found faithful.<br><a name="3">3</a>  But with me it is a very small thing that I should be judged of you, or of man's judgment: yea, I judge not mine own self.<br><a name="4">4</a>  For I know nothing by myself; yet am I not hereby justified: but he that judgeth me is the Lord.<br><a name="5">5</a>  Therefore judge nothing before the time, until the Lord come, who both will bring to light the hidden things of darkness, and will make manifest the counsels of the hearts: and then shall every man have praise of God.<br><a name="6">6</a>  And these things, brethren, I have in a figure transferred to myself and [to] Apollos for your sakes; that ye might learn in us not to think [of men] above that which is written, that no one of you be puffed up for one against another.<br><a name="7">7</a>. For who maketh thee to differ [from another]? and what hast thou that thou didst not receive? now if thou didst receive [it], why dost thou glory, as if thou hadst not received [it]?<br><a name="8">8</a>  Now ye are full, now ye are rich, ye have reigned as kings without us: and I would to God ye did reign, that we also might reign with you.<br><a name="9">9</a>  For I think that God hath set forth us the apostles last, as it were appointed to death: for we are made a spectacle unto the world, and to angels, and to men.<br><a name="10">10</a>  We [are] fools for Christ's sake, but ye [are] wise in Christ; we [are] weak, but ye [are] strong; ye [are] honourable, but we [are] despised.<br><a name="11">11</a>  Even unto this present hour we both hunger, and thirst, and are naked, and are buffeted, and have no certain dwellingplace;<br><a name="12">12</a>  And labour, working with our own hands: being reviled, we bless; being persecuted, we suffer it:<br><a name="13">13</a>  Being defamed, we intreat: we are made as the filth of the world, [and are] the offscouring of all things unto this day.<br><a name="14">14</a>. I write not these things to shame you, but as my beloved sons I warn [you].<br><a name="15">15</a>  For though ye have ten thousand instructors in Christ, yet [have ye] not many fathers: for in Christ Jesus I have begotten you through the gospel.<br><a name="16">16</a>  Wherefore I beseech you, be ye followers of me.<br><a name="17">17</a>. For this cause have I sent unto you Timotheus, who is my beloved son, and faithful in the Lord, who shall bring you into remembrance of my ways which be in Christ, as I teach every where in every church.<br><a name="18">18</a>  Now some are puffed up, as though I would not come to you.<br><a name="19">19</a>  But I will come to you shortly, if the Lord will, and will know, not the speech of them which are puffed up, but the power.<br><a name="20">20</a>  For the kingdom of God [is] not in word, but in power.<br><a name="21">21</a>  What will ye? shall I come unto you with a rod, or in love, and [in] the spirit of meekness?<br><br>Go to <a href="1cor5.htm#1">I Corinthians 5</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
