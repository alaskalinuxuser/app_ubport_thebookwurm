Ecclesiastes  11<br>1. Cast thy bread upon the waters: for thou shalt find it after many days.<br><a name="2">2</a>  Give a portion to seven, and also to eight; for thou knowest not what evil shall be upon the earth.<br><a name="3">3</a>  If the clouds be full of rain, they empty [themselves] upon the earth: and if the tree fall toward the south, or toward the north, in the place where the tree falleth, there it shall be.<br><a name="4">4</a>  He that observeth the wind shall not sow; and he that regardeth the clouds shall not reap.<br><a name="5">5</a>  As thou knowest not what [is] the way of the spirit, [nor] how the bones [do grow] in the womb of her that is with child: even so thou knowest not the works of God who maketh all.<br><a name="6">6</a>  In the morning sow thy seed, and in the evening withhold not thine hand: for thou knowest not whether shall prosper, either this or that, or whether they both [shall be] alike good.<br><a name="7">7</a>. Truly the light [is] sweet, and a pleasant [thing it is] for the eyes to behold the sun:<br><a name="8">8</a>  But if a man live many years, [and] rejoice in them all; yet let him remember the days of darkness; for they shall be many. All that cometh [is] vanity.<br><a name="9">9</a>  Rejoice, O young man, in thy youth; and let thy heart cheer thee in the days of thy youth, and walk in the ways of thine heart, and in the sight of thine eyes: but know thou, that for all these [things] God will bring thee into judgment.<br><a name="10">10</a>  Therefore remove sorrow from thy heart, and put away evil from thy flesh: for childhood and youth [are] vanity.<br><br>Go to <a href="ecc12.htm#1">Ecclesiastes 12</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
