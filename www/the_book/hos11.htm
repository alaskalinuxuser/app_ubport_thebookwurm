Hosea  11<br>1. When Israel [was] a child, then I loved him, and called my son out of Egypt.<br><a name="2">2</a>  [As] they called them, so they went from them: they sacrificed unto Baalim, and burned incense to graven images.<br><a name="3">3</a>  I taught Ephraim also to go, taking them by their arms; but they knew not that I healed them.<br><a name="4">4</a>  I drew them with cords of a man, with bands of love: and I was to them as they that take off the yoke on their jaws, and I laid meat unto them.<br><a name="5">5</a>  He shall not return into the land of Egypt, but the Assyrian shall be his king, because they refused to return.<br><a name="6">6</a>  And the sword shall abide on his cities, and shall consume his branches, and devour [them], because of their own counsels.<br><a name="7">7</a>  And my people are bent to backsliding from me: though they called them to the most High, none at all would exalt [him].<br><a name="8">8</a>. How shall I give thee up, Ephraim? [how] shall I deliver thee, Israel? how shall I make thee as Admah? [how] shall I set thee as Zeboim? mine heart is turned within me, my repentings are kindled together.<br><a name="9">9</a>  I will not execute the fierceness of mine anger, I will not return to destroy Ephraim: for I [am] God, and not man; the Holy One in the midst of thee: and I will not enter into the city.<br><a name="10">10</a>  They shall walk after the LORD: he shall roar like a lion: when he shall roar, then the children shall tremble from the west.<br><a name="11">11</a>  They shall tremble as a bird out of Egypt, and as a dove out of the land of Assyria: and I will place them in their houses, saith the LORD.<br><a name="12">12</a>  Ephraim compasseth me about with lies, and the house of Israel with deceit: but Judah yet ruleth with God, and is faithful with the saints.<br><br>Go to <a href="hos12.htm#1">Hosea 12</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
