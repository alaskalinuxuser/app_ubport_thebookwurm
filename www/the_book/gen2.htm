Thus the heavens and the earth were finished, and all the host of them.<br><a name="2">2</a>  And on the seventh day God ended his work which he had made; and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made.<br><a name="3">3</a>  And God blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it: because that in it he had rested from all his work which God created and made.<br><a name="4">4</a>. These [are] the generations of the heavens and of the earth when they were created, in the day that the LORD God made the earth and the heavens,<br><a name="5">5</a>  And every plant of the field before it was in the earth, and every herb of the field before it grew: for the LORD God had not caused it to rain upon the earth, and [there was] not a man to till the ground.<br><a name="6">6</a>  But there went up a mist from the earth, and watered the whole face of the ground.<br><a name="7">7</a>  And the LORD God formed man [of] the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul.<br><a name="8">8</a>. And the LORD God planted a garden eastward in Eden; and there he put the man whom he had formed.<br><a name="9">9</a>  And out of the ground made the LORD God to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight, and good for food; the tree of life also in the midst of the garden, and the tree of knowledge of good and evil.<br><a name="10">10</a>  And a river went out of Eden to water the garden; and from thence it was parted, and became into four heads.<br><a name="11">11</a>  The name of the first [is] Pison: that [is] it which compasseth the whole land of Havilah, where [there is] gold;<br><a name="12">12</a>  And the gold of that land [is] good: there [is] bdellium and the onyx stone.<br><a name="13">13</a>  And the name of the second river [is] Gihon: the same [is] it that compasseth the whole land of Ethiopia.<br><a name="14">14</a>  And the name of the third river [is] Hiddekel: that [is] it which goeth toward the east of Assyria. And the fourth river [is] Euphrates.<br><a name="15"></a> 15  And the LORD God took the man, and put him into the garden of Eden to dress it and to keep it.<br><a name="16">16</a>. And the LORD God commanded the man, saying, Of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat:<br><a name="17">17</a>  But of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it: for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die.<br><a name="18">18</a>. And the LORD God said, [It is] not good that the man should be alone; I will make him an help meet for him.<br><a name="19">19</a>  And out of the ground the LORD God formed every beast of the field, and every fowl of the air; and brought [them] unto Adam to see what he would call them: and whatsoever Adam called every living creature, that [was] the name thereof.<br><a name="20">20</a>  And Adam gave names to all cattle, and to the fowl of the air, and to every beast of the field; but for Adam there was not found an help meet for him.<br><a name="21">21</a>. And the LORD God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam, and he slept: and he took one of his ribs, and closed up the flesh instead thereof;<br><a name="22">22</a>  And the rib, which the LORD God had taken from man, made he a woman, and brought her unto the man.<br><a name="23">23</a>  And Adam said, This [is] now bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh: she shall be called Woman, because she was taken out of Man.<br><a name="24">24</a>  Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife: and they shall be one flesh.<br><a name="25">25</a>  And they were both naked, the man and his wife, and were not ashamed.<br><br>Go to <a href="gen3.htm#1">Genesis 3</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
