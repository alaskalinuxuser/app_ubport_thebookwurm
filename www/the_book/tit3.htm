Titus   3<br> 1. Put them in mind to be subject to principalities and powers, to obey magistrates, to be ready to every good work,<br><a name="2">2</a>  To speak evil of no man, to be no brawlers, [but] gentle, shewing all meekness unto all men.<br><a name="3">3</a>  For we ourselves also were sometimes foolish, disobedient, deceived, serving divers lusts and pleasures, living in malice and envy, hateful, [and] hating one another.<br><a name="4">4</a>  But after that the kindness and love of God our Saviour toward man appeared,<br><a name="5">5</a>  Not by works of righteousness which we have done, but according to his mercy he saved us, by the washing of regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Ghost;<br><a name="6">6</a>  Which he shed on us abundantly through Jesus Christ our Saviour;<br><a name="7">7</a>  That being justified by his grace, we should be made heirs according to the hope of eternal life.<br><a name="8">8</a>  [This is] a faithful saying, and these things I will that thou affirm constantly, that they which have believed in God might be careful to maintain good works. These things are good and profitable unto men.<br><a name="9">9</a>. But avoid foolish questions, and genealogies, and contentions, and strivings about the law; for they are unprofitable and vain.<br><a name="10">10</a>  A man that is an heretick after the first and second admonition reject;<br><a name="11">11</a>  Knowing that he that is such is subverted, and sinneth, being condemned of himself.<br><a name="12">12</a>  When I shall send Artemas unto thee, or Tychicus, be diligent to come unto me to Nicopolis: for I have determined there to winter.<br><a name="13">13</a>  Bring Zenas the lawyer and Apollos on their journey diligently, that nothing be wanting unto them.<br><a name="14">14</a>  And let ours also learn to maintain good works for necessary uses, that they be not unfruitful.<br><a name="15">15</a>  All that are with me salute thee. Greet them that love us in the faith. Grace [be] with you all. Amen.<br><br>End of Titus.<br>Go to <a href="phm1.htm#1">Philemon 1</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
