Psalms  21<br> 1. To the chief Musician, A Psalm of David. The king shall joy in thy strength, O LORD; and in thy salvation how greatly shall he rejoice!<br><a name="2">2</a>  Thou hast given him his heart's desire, and hast not withholden the request of his lips. Selah.<br><a name="3">3</a>  For thou preventest him with the blessings of goodness: thou settest a crown of pure gold on his head.<br><a name="4">4</a>  He asked life of thee, [and] thou gavest [it] him, [even] length of days for ever and ever.<br><a name="5">5</a>  His glory [is] great in thy salvation: honour and majesty hast thou laid upon him.<br><a name="6">6</a>  For thou hast made him most blessed for ever: thou hast made him exceeding glad with thy countenance.<br><a name="7">7</a>. For the king trusteth in the LORD, and through the mercy of the most High he shall not be moved.<br><a name="8">8</a>  Thine hand shall find out all thine enemies: thy right hand shall find out those that hate thee.<br><a name="9">9</a>  Thou shalt make them as a fiery oven in the time of thine anger: the LORD shall swallow them up in his wrath, and the fire shall devour them.<br><a name="10">10</a>  Their fruit shalt thou destroy from the earth, and their seed from among the children of men.<br><a name="11">11</a>  For they intended evil against thee: they imagined a mischievous device, [which] they are not able [to perform].<br><a name="12">12</a>  Therefore shalt thou make them turn their back, [when] thou shalt make ready [thine arrows] upon thy strings against the face of them.<br><a name="13">13</a>  Be thou exalted, LORD, in thine own strength: [so] will we sing and praise thy power.<br><br>Go to <a href="psa22.htm#1">Psalm 22</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
