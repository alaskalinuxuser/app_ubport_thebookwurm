Song of Solomon   4<br> 1. Behold, thou [art] fair, my love; behold, thou [art] fair; thou [hast] doves' eyes within thy locks: thy hair [is] as a flock of goats, that appear from mount Gilead.<br><a name="2">2</a>  Thy teeth [are] like a flock [of sheep that are even] shorn, which came up from the washing; whereof every one bear twins, and none [is] barren among them.<br><a name="3">3</a>  Thy lips [are] like a thread of scarlet, and thy speech [is] comely: thy temples [are] like a piece of a pomegranate within thy locks.<br><a name="4">4</a>  Thy neck [is] like the tower of David builded for an armoury, whereon there hang a thousand bucklers, all shields of mighty men.<br><a name="5">5</a>  Thy two breasts [are] like two young roes that are twins, which feed among the lilies.<br><a name="6">6</a>  Until the day break, and the shadows flee away, I will get me to the mountain of myrrh, and to the hill of frankincense.<br><a name="7">7</a>  Thou [art] all fair, my love; [there is] no spot in thee.<br><a name="8">8</a>. Come with me from Lebanon, [my] spouse, with me from Lebanon: look from the top of Amana, from the top of Shenir and Hermon, from the lions' dens, from the mountains of the leopards.<br><a name="9">9</a>  Thou hast ravished my heart, my sister, [my] spouse; thou hast ravished my heart with one of thine eyes, with one chain of thy neck.<br><a name="10">10</a>  How fair is thy love, my sister, [my] spouse! how much better is thy love than wine! and the smell of thine ointments than all spices!<br><a name="11">11</a>  Thy lips, O [my] spouse, drop [as] the honeycomb: honey and milk [are] under thy tongue; and the smell of thy garments [is] like the smell of Lebanon.<br><a name="12">12</a>  A garden inclosed [is] my sister, [my] spouse; a spring shut up, a fountain sealed.<br><a name="13">13</a>  Thy plants [are] an orchard of pomegranates, with pleasant fruits; camphire, with spikenard,<br><a name="14">14</a>  Spikenard and saffron; calamus and cinnamon, with all trees of frankincense; myrrh and aloes, with all the chief spices:<br><a name="15">15</a>. A fountain of gardens, a well of living waters, and streams from Lebanon.<br><a name="16">16</a>  Awake, O north wind; and come, thou south; blow upon my garden, [that] the spices thereof may flow out. Let my beloved come into his garden, and eat his pleasant fruits.<br><br>Go to <a href="song5.htm#1">Song of Solomon 5</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
