Revelation   5<br> 1. And I saw in the right hand of him that sat on the throne a book written within and on the backside, sealed with seven seals.<br><a name="2">2</a>  And I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice, Who is worthy to open the book, and to loose the seals thereof?<br><a name="3">3</a>  And no man in heaven, nor in earth, neither under the earth, was able to open the book, neither to look thereon.<br><a name="4">4</a>  And I wept much, because no man was found worthy to open and to read the book, neither to look thereon.<br><a name="5">5</a>  And one of the elders saith unto me, Weep not: behold, the Lion of the tribe of Juda, the Root of David, hath prevailed to open the book, and to loose the seven seals thereof.<br><a name="6">6</a>. And I beheld, and, lo, in the midst of the throne and of the four beasts, and in the midst of the elders, stood a Lamb as it had been slain, having seven horns and seven eyes, which are the seven Spirits of God sent forth into all the earth.<br><a name="7">7</a>  And he came and took the book out of the right hand of him that sat upon the throne.<br><a name="8">8</a>  And when he had taken the book, the four beasts and four [and] twenty elders fell down before the Lamb, having every one of them harps, and golden vials full of odours, which are the prayers of saints.<br><a name="9">9</a>  And they sung a new song, saying, Thou art worthy to take the book, and to open the seals thereof: for thou wast slain, and hast redeemed us to God by thy blood out of every kindred, and tongue, and people, and nation;<br><a name="10">10</a>  And hast made us unto our God kings and priests: and we shall reign on the earth.<br><a name="11">11</a>  And I beheld, and I heard the voice of many angels round about the throne and the beasts and the elders: and the number of them was ten thousand times ten thousand, and thousands of thousands;<br><a name="12">12</a>  Saying with a loud voice, Worthy is the Lamb that was slain to receive power, and riches, and wisdom, and strength, and honour, and glory, and blessing.<br><a name="13">13</a>  And every creature which is in heaven, and on the earth, and under the earth, and such as are in the sea, and all that are in them, heard I saying, Blessing, and honour, and glory, and power, [be] unto him that sitteth upon the throne, and unto the Lamb for ever and ever.<br><a name="14">14</a>  And the four beasts said, Amen. And the four [and] twenty elders fell down and worshipped him that liveth for ever and ever.<br><br>Go to <a href="rev6.htm#1">Revelation 6</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
