Psalms  49<br> 1. To the chief Musician, A Psalm for the sons of Korah. Hear this, all [ye] people; give ear, all [ye] inhabitants of the world:<br><a name="2">2</a>  Both low and high, rich and poor, together.<br><a name="3">3</a>  My mouth shall speak of wisdom; and the meditation of my heart [shall be] of understanding.<br><a name="4">4</a>  I will incline mine ear to a parable: I will open my dark saying upon the harp.<br><a name="5">5</a>  Wherefore should I fear in the days of evil, [when] the iniquity of my heels shall compass me about?<br><a name="6">6</a>. They that trust in their wealth, and boast themselves in the multitude of their riches;<br><a name="7">7</a>  None [of them] can by any means redeem his brother, nor give to God a ransom for him:<br><a name="8">8</a>  (For the redemption of their soul [is] precious, and it ceaseth for ever:)<br><a name="9">9</a>  That he should still live for ever, [and] not see corruption.<br><a name="10">10</a>  For he seeth [that] wise men die, likewise the fool and the brutish person perish, and leave their wealth to others.<br><a name="11">11</a>  Their inward thought [is, that] their houses [shall continue] for ever, [and] their dwelling places to all generations; they call [their] lands after their own names.<br><a name="12">12</a>  Nevertheless man [being] in honour abideth not: he is like the beasts [that] perish.<br><a name="13">13</a>  This their way [is] their folly: yet their posterity approve their sayings. Selah.<br><a name="14">14</a>  Like sheep they are laid in the grave; death shall feed on them; and the upright shall have dominion over them in the morning; and their beauty shall consume in the grave from their dwelling.<br><a name="15">15</a>. But God will redeem my soul from the power of the grave: for he shall receive me. Selah.<br><a name="16">16</a>  Be not thou afraid when one is made rich, when the glory of his house is increased;<br><a name="17">17</a>  For when he dieth he shall carry nothing away: his glory shall not descend after him.<br><a name="18">18</a>  Though while he lived he blessed his soul: and [men] will praise thee, when thou doest well to thyself.<br><a name="19">19</a>  He shall go to the generation of his fathers; they shall never see light.<br><a name="20">20</a>  Man [that is] in honour, and understandeth not, is like the beasts [that] perish.<br><br>Go to <a href="psa50.htm#1">Psalm 50</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
