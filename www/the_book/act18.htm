Acts  18<br> 1. After these things Paul departed from Athens, and came to Corinth;<br><a name="2">2</a>  And found a certain Jew named Aquila, born in Pontus, lately come from Italy, with his wife Priscilla; (because that Claudius had commanded all Jews to depart from Rome:) and came unto them.<br><a name="3">3</a>  And because he was of the same craft, he abode with them, and wrought: for by their occupation they were tentmakers.<br><a name="4">4</a>  And he reasoned in the synagogue every sabbath, and persuaded the Jews and the Greeks.<br><a name="5">5</a>  And when Silas and Timotheus were come from Macedonia, Paul was pressed in the spirit, and testified to the Jews [that] Jesus [was] Christ.<br><a name="6">6</a>  And when they opposed themselves, and blasphemed, he shook [his] raiment, and said unto them, Your blood [be] upon your own heads; I [am] clean: from henceforth I will go unto the Gentiles.<br><a name="7">7</a>. And he departed thence, and entered into a certain [man's] house, named Justus, [one] that worshipped God, whose house joined hard to the synagogue.<br><a name="8">8</a>  And Crispus, the chief ruler of the synagogue, believed on the Lord with all his house; and many of the Corinthians hearing believed, and were baptized.<br><a name="9">9</a>  Then spake the Lord to Paul in the night by a vision, Be not afraid, but speak, and hold not thy peace:<br><a name="10">10</a>  For I am with thee, and no man shall set on thee to hurt thee: for I have much people in this city.<br><a name="11">11</a>  And he continued [there] a year and six months, teaching the word of God among them.<br><a name="12">12</a>. And when Gallio was the deputy of Achaia, the Jews made insurrection with one accord against Paul, and brought him to the judgment seat,<br><a name="13">13</a>  Saying, This [fellow] persuadeth men to worship God contrary to the law.<br><a name="14">14</a>  And when Paul was now about to open [his] mouth, Gallio said unto the Jews, If it were a matter of wrong or wicked lewdness, O [ye] Jews, reason would that I should bear with you:<br><a name="15">15</a>  But if it be a question of words and names, and [of] your law, look ye [to it]; for I will be no judge of such [matters].<br><a name="16">16</a>  And he drave them from the judgment seat.<br><a name="17">17</a>  Then all the Greeks took Sosthenes, the chief ruler of the synagogue, and beat [him] before the judgment seat. And Gallio cared for none of those things.<br><a name="18">18</a>. And Paul [after this] tarried [there] yet a good while, and then took his leave of the brethren, and sailed thence into Syria, and with him Priscilla and Aquila; having shorn [his] head in Cenchrea: for he had a vow.<br><a name="19">19</a>  And he came to Ephesus, and left them there: but he himself entered into the synagogue, and reasoned with the Jews.<br><a name="20">20</a>  When they desired [him] to tarry longer time with them, he consented not;<br><a name="21">21</a>  But bade them farewell, saying, I must by all means keep this feast that cometh in Jerusalem: but I will return again unto you, if God will. And he sailed from Ephesus.<br><a name="22">22</a>  And when he had landed at Caesarea, and gone up, and saluted the church, he went down to Antioch.<br><a name="23">23</a>  And after he had spent some time [there], he departed, and went over [all] the country of Galatia and Phrygia in order, strengthening all the disciples.<br><a name="24">24</a>. And a certain Jew named Apollos, born at Alexandria, an eloquent man, [and] mighty in the scriptures, came to Ephesus.<br><a name="25">25</a>  This man was instructed in the way of the Lord; and being fervent in the spirit, he spake and taught diligently the things of the Lord, knowing only the baptism of John.<br><a name="26">26</a>  And he began to speak boldly in the synagogue: whom when Aquila and Priscilla had heard, they took him unto [them], and expounded unto him the way of God more perfectly.<br><a name="27">27</a>  And when he was disposed to pass into Achaia, the brethren wrote, exhorting the disciples to receive him: who, when he was come, helped them much which had believed through grace:<br><a name="28">28</a>  For he mightily convinced the Jews, [and that] publickly, shewing by the scriptures that Jesus was Christ.<br><br>Go to <a href="act19.htm#1">Acts 19</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
