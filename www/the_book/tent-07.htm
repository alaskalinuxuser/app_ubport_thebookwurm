<dt><b>7 - The Door</b> - <br><dd>
<a href="ex26.htm#36" target="lwr_lt">Ex 26:36,37</a>. Chapter 26 of Exodus describes the Tabernacle proper, God's dwelling in the midst of His people. Since we apprehend the truth in the reverse order from that in which the Holy Spirit has described the Tabernacle, we will begin this chapter with the study of the Door.<p>
<b>The material</b> of which the Door was made was the same as that of the Gate, blue, purple, scarlet, and fine-twined linen.
</p><p>
It hung, at the east end, or entrance of the Tabernacle, upon five pillars of shittim wood, which were overlaid with gold, and which rested upon five sockets of brass. This was the only brass used in the Tabernacle proper.
</p><p>
<b>For us,</b> the Door is clearly a shadow of Him who said ''I am the Door.'' <a href="joh10.htm#7">Joh 10:7,9</a>
</p><p>
<b>The key verse</b> which opens up to us the typical meaning of the Tabernacle is <a href="heb9.htm#24">Heb 9:24</a>. Here we learn that the Holy Places are figures of heaven, where Christ is now appearing in God's presence for us. The Door is, therefore, a type of Christ where He is now.
</p><p>
The Gate represents the historical Christ as revealed in the four Gosples, but the Door, upheld by <b>five</b> pillars, is typical of the risen and glorified Christ, as revealed through the five writers of the Epistles, Paul, Peter, James, John, and Jude. <a href="2cor5.htm#16">2Cor 5:16</a>
</p><p>
Christ, as the Door, is the One through whom we have ''access into this grace wherein we stand.'' <a href="rom5.htm#2">Rom 5:2</a>; <a href="eph2.htm#18">Eph 2:18</a>
</p><p>
Only as our minds and hearts are <b>occupied with the person of our glorious Lord,</b> may we enter into the realization of the place of favor and of the blessings which God has given us in Christ.
</p><p>
Very many of God's own dear ones seem to have taken but few steps God-ward. They have come under the Gate, or <b>repented</b> of their sins, and have come to the Brazen Altar, or <b>believed</b> that Christ died for their sins, thus realizing forgiveness.
</p><p>
But they have not <b>yielded</b> unto God, as His redeemed ones, to come into His presence as priests, who are sanctified, or set apart and cleansed for service. When we yield ourselves unto God, then He separates us by His Holy Spirit, and in the fulness of His Spirit we are sanctified by His word. Then the Holy Spirit begins to reveal to us our living Saviour and Lord, and the things that are ours in Him. Oh, how our minds and hearts are then set upon the things which are above, where Christ is. (<a href="col3.htm#1">Col 3:1-2</a>) Then we begin to seek the things which are unseen and eternal, not the things of earth. (<a href="2cor4.htm#18">2Cor 4:18</a>) Then we begin to remember His precious word, to hide it in our hearts that we may not sin against the One who is all in all to us, the One who is ''altogether lovely.'' Then too, we begin to enjoy ''the hidden life,'' a life of conscious fellowship with Him, a life of separation from the world and from sin. (<a href="col3.htm#3">Col 3:3</a>; <a href="2cor6.htm#14">2Cor 6:14-18</a>; <a href="2cor7.htm#1">7:1</a>) Much more than that, as our hearts are occupied with our risen Lord, we will enjoy ''the power of His resurrection.'' <a href="php3.htm#10">Php 3:10</a>
</p><p>
<b>The brass sockets,</b> the foundation for the pillars upholding the Door, suggest to us the self-judgment so essential to enjoying a life of abiding fellowship with our Lord. (<a href="rom8.htm#13">Rom 8:13</a>; <a href="1cor11.htm#28">1Cor 11:28-32</a>) They also suggest the judgment of our works as believers, which is yet future and will take place in heaven when the Lord comes for His church. <a href="2cor5.htm#10">2Cor 5:10</a>; <a href="1cor3.htm#9">1Cor 3:9-15</a></p></dl>
