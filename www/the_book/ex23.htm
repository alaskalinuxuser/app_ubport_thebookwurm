Exodus  23<br>1. Thou shalt not raise a false report: put not thine hand with the wicked to be an unrighteous witness.<br><a name="2">2</a>  Thou shalt not follow a multitude to [do] evil; neither shalt thou speak in a cause to decline after many to wrest [judgment]:<br><a name="3">3</a>  Neither shalt thou countenance a poor man in his cause.<br><a name="4">4</a>  If thou meet thine enemy's ox or his ass going astray, thou shalt surely bring it back to him again.<br><a name="5">5</a>  If thou see the ass of him that hateth thee lying under his burden, and wouldest forbear to help him, thou shalt surely help with him.<br><a name="6">6</a>  Thou shalt not wrest the judgment of thy poor in his cause.<br><a name="7">7</a>  Keep thee far from a false matter; and the innocent and righteous slay thou not: for I will not justify the wicked.<br><a name="8">8</a>  And thou shalt take no gift: for the gift blindeth the wise, and perverteth the words of the righteous.<br><a name="9">9</a>  Also thou shalt not oppress a stranger: for ye know the heart of a stranger, seeing ye were strangers in the land of Egypt.<br><a name="10">10</a>. And six years thou shalt sow thy land, and shalt gather in the fruits thereof:<br><a name="11">11</a>  But the seventh [year] thou shalt let it rest and lie still; that the poor of thy people may eat: and what they leave the beasts of the field shall eat. In like manner thou shalt deal with thy vineyard, [and] with thy oliveyard.<br><a name="12">12</a>  Six days thou shalt do thy work, and on the seventh day thou shalt rest: that thine ox and thine ass may rest, and the son of thy handmaid, and the stranger, may be refreshed.<br><a name="13">13</a>  And in all [things] that I have said unto you be circumspect: and make no mention of the name of other gods, neither let it be heard out of thy mouth.<br><a name="14">14</a>  Three times thou shalt keep a feast unto me in the year.<br><a name="15">15</a>  Thou shalt keep the feast of unleavened bread: (thou shalt eat unleavened bread seven days, as I commanded thee, in the time appointed of the month Abib; for in it thou camest out from Egypt: and none shall appear before me empty:)<br><a name="16">16</a>  And the feast of harvest, the firstfruits of thy labours, which thou hast sown in the field: and the feast of ingathering, [which is] in the end of the year, when thou hast gathered in thy labours out of the field.<br><a name="17">17</a>  Three times in the year all thy males shall appear before the Lord GOD.<br><a name="18">18</a>  Thou shalt not offer the blood of my sacrifice with leavened bread; neither shall the fat of my sacrifice remain until the morning.<br><a name="19">19</a>  The first of the firstfruits of thy land thou shalt bring into the house of the LORD thy God. Thou shalt not seethe a kid in his mother's milk.<br><a name="20">20</a>. Behold, I send an Angel before thee, to keep thee in the way, and to bring thee into the place which I have prepared.<br><a name="21">21</a>  Beware of him, and obey his voice, provoke him not; for he will not pardon your transgressions: for my name [is] in him.<br><a name="22">22</a>  But if thou shalt indeed obey his voice, and do all that I speak; then I will be an enemy unto thine enemies, and an adversary unto thine adversaries.<br><a name="23">23</a>  For mine Angel shall go before thee, and bring thee in unto the Amorites, and the Hittites, and the Perizzites, and the Canaanites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites: and I will cut them off.<br><a name="24">24</a>  Thou shalt not bow down to their gods, nor serve them, nor do after their works: but thou shalt utterly overthrow them, and quite break down their images.<br><a name="25">25</a>  And ye shall serve the LORD your God, and he shall bless thy bread, and thy water; and I will take sickness away from the midst of thee.<br><a name="26">26</a>  There shall nothing cast their young, nor be barren, in thy land: the number of thy days I will fulfil.<br><a name="27">27</a>  I will send my fear before thee, and will destroy all the people to whom thou shalt come, and I will make all thine enemies turn their backs unto thee.<br><a name="28">28</a>  And I will send hornets before thee, which shall drive out the Hivite, the Canaanite, and the Hittite, from before thee.<br><a name="29">29</a>  I will not drive them out from before thee in one year; lest the land become desolate, and the beast of the field multiply against thee.<br><a name="30">30</a>  By little and little I will drive them out from before thee, until thou be increased, and inherit the land.<br><a name="31">31</a>  And I will set thy bounds from the Red sea even unto the sea of the Philistines, and from the desert unto the river: for I will deliver the inhabitants of the land into your hand; and thou shalt drive them out before thee.<br><a name="32">32</a>  Thou shalt make no covenant with them, nor with their gods.<br><a name="33">33</a>  They shall not dwell in thy land, lest they make thee sin against me: for if thou serve their gods, it will surely be a snare unto thee.<br><br>Go to <a href="ex24.htm#1">Exodus 24</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
