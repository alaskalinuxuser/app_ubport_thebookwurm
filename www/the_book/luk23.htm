Luke  23<br> 1. And the whole multitude of them arose, and led him unto Pilate.<br><a name="2">2</a>  And they began to accuse him, saying, We found this [fellow] perverting the nation, and forbidding to give tribute to Caesar, saying that he himself is Christ a King.<br><a name="3">3</a>  And Pilate asked him, saying, Art thou the King of the Jews? And he answered him and said, Thou sayest [it].<br><a name="4">4</a>  Then said Pilate to the chief priests and [to] the people, I find no fault in this man.<br><a name="5">5</a>  And they were the more fierce, saying, He stirreth up the people, teaching throughout all Jewry, beginning from Galilee to this place.<br><a name="6">6</a>  When Pilate heard of Galilee, he asked whether the man were a Galilaean.<br><a name="7">7</a>  And as soon as he knew that he belonged unto Herod's jurisdiction, he sent him to Herod, who himself also was at Jerusalem at that time.<br><a name="8">8</a>  And when Herod saw Jesus, he was exceeding glad: for he was desirous to see him of a long [season], because he had heard many things of him; and he hoped to have seen some miracle done by him.<br><a name="9">9</a>  Then he questioned with him in many words; but he answered him nothing.<br><a name="10">10</a>  And the chief priests and scribes stood and vehemently accused him.<br><a name="11">11</a>  And Herod with his men of war set him at nought, and mocked [him], and arrayed him in a gorgeous robe, and sent him again to Pilate.<br><a name="12">12</a>  And the same day Pilate and Herod were made friends together: for before they were at enmity between themselves.<br><a name="13">13</a>. And Pilate, when he had called together the chief priests and the rulers and the people,<br><a name="14">14</a>  Said unto them, Ye have brought this man unto me, as one that perverteth the people: and, behold, I, having examined [him] before you, have found no fault in this man touching those things whereof ye accuse him:<br><a name="15">15</a>  No, nor yet Herod: for I sent you to him; and, lo, nothing worthy of death is done unto him.<br><a name="16">16</a>  I will therefore chastise him, and release [him].<br><a name="17">17</a>  (For of necessity he must release one unto them at the feast.)<br><a name="18">18</a>  And they cried out all at once, saying, Away with this [man], and release unto us Barabbas:<br><a name="19">19</a>  (Who for a certain sedition made in the city, and for murder, was cast into prison.)<br><a name="20">20</a>  Pilate therefore, willing to release Jesus, spake again to them.<br><a name="21">21</a>  But they cried, saying, Crucify [him], crucify him.<br><a name="22">22</a>  And he said unto them the third time, Why, what evil hath he done? I have found no cause of death in him: I will therefore chastise him, and let [him] go.<br><a name="23">23</a>  And they were instant with loud voices, requiring that he might be crucified. And the voices of them and of the chief priests prevailed.<br><a name="24">24</a>  And Pilate gave sentence that it should be as they required.<br><a name="25">25</a>  And he released unto them him that for sedition and murder was cast into prison, whom they had desired; but he delivered Jesus to their will.<br><a name="26">26</a>. And as they led him away, they laid hold upon one Simon, a Cyrenian, coming out of the country, and on him they laid the cross, that he might bear [it] after Jesus.<br><a name="27">27</a>  And there followed him a great company of people, and of women, which also bewailed and lamented him.<br><a name="28">28</a>  But Jesus turning unto them said, Daughters of Jerusalem, weep not for me, but weep for yourselves, and for your children.<br><a name="29">29</a>  For, behold, the days are coming, in the which they shall say, Blessed [are] the barren, and the wombs that never bare, and the paps which never gave suck.<br><a name="30">30</a>  Then shall they begin to say to the mountains, Fall on us; and to the hills, Cover us.<br><a name="31">31</a>  For if they do these things in a green tree, what shall be done in the dry?<br><a name="32">32</a>. And there were also two other, malefactors, led with him to be put to death.<br><a name="33">33</a>  And when they were come to the place, which is called Calvary, there they crucified him, and the malefactors, one on the right hand, and the other on the left.<br><a name="34">34</a>  Then said Jesus, Father, forgive them; for they know not what they do. And they parted his raiment, and cast lots.<br><a name="35">35</a>  And the people stood beholding. And the rulers also with them derided [him], saying, He saved others; let him save himself, if he be Christ, the chosen of God.<br><a name="36">36</a>  And the soldiers also mocked him, coming to him, and offering him vinegar,<br><a name="37">37</a>  And saying, If thou be the king of the Jews, save thyself.<br><a name="38">38</a>  And a superscription also was written over him in letters of Greek, and Latin, and Hebrew, THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS.<br><a name="39">39</a>  And one of the malefactors which were hanged railed on him, saying, If thou be Christ, save thyself and us.<br><a name="40">40</a>  But the other answering rebuked him, saying, Dost not thou fear God, seeing thou art in the same condemnation?<br><a name="41">41</a>  And we indeed justly; for we receive the due reward of our deeds: but this man hath done nothing amiss.<br><a name="42">42</a>  And he said unto Jesus, Lord, remember me when thou comest into thy kingdom.<br><a name="43">43</a>  And Jesus said unto him, Verily I say unto thee, To day shalt thou be with me in paradise.<br><a name="44">44</a>. And it was about the sixth hour, and there was a darkness over all the earth until the ninth hour.<br><a name="45">45</a>  And the sun was darkened, and the veil of the temple was rent in the midst.<br><a name="46">46</a>  And when Jesus had cried with a loud voice, he said, Father, into thy hands I commend my spirit: and having said thus, he gave up the ghost.<br><a name="47">47</a>  Now when the centurion saw what was done, he glorified God, saying, Certainly this was a righteous man.<br><a name="48">48</a>  And all the people that came together to that sight, beholding the things which were done, smote their breasts, and returned.<br><a name="49">49</a>  And all his acquaintance, and the women that followed him from Galilee, stood afar off, beholding these things.<br><a name="50">50</a>. And, behold, [there was] a man named Joseph, a counsellor; [and he was] a good man, and a just:<br><a name="51">51</a>  (The same had not consented to the counsel and deed of them;) [he was] of Arimathaea, a city of the Jews: who also himself waited for the kingdom of God.<br><a name="52">52</a>  This [man] went unto Pilate, and begged the body of Jesus.<br><a name="53">53</a>  And he took it down, and wrapped it in linen, and laid it in a sepulchre that was hewn in stone, wherein never man before was laid.<br><a name="54">54</a>  And that day was the preparation, and the sabbath drew on.<br><a name="55">55</a>  And the women also, which came with him from Galilee, followed after, and beheld the sepulchre, and how his body was laid.<br><a name="56">56</a>  And they returned, and prepared spices and ointments; and rested the sabbath day according to the commandment.<br><br>Go to <a href="luk24.htm#1">Luke 24</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
