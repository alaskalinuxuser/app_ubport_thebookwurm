Genesis  11<br>1. And the whole earth was of one language, and of one speech.<br><a name="2">2</a>  And it came to pass, as they journeyed from the east, that they found a plain in the land of Shinar; and they dwelt there.<br><a name="3">3</a>  And they said one to another, Go to, let us make brick, and burn them throughly. And they had brick for stone, and slime had they for morter.<br><a name="4">4</a>  And they said, Go to, let us build us a city and a tower, whose top [may reach] unto heaven; and let us make us a name, lest we be scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth.<br><a name="5">5</a>. And the LORD came down to see the city and the tower, which the children of men builded.<br><a name="6">6</a>  And the LORD said, Behold, the people [is] one, and they have all one language; and this they begin to do: and now nothing will be restrained from them, which they have imagined to do.<br><a name="7">7</a>  Go to, let us go down, and there confound their language, that they may not understand one another's speech.<br><a name="8">8</a>  So the LORD scattered them abroad from thence upon the face of all the earth: and they left off to build the city.<br><a name="9">9</a>  Therefore is the name of it called Babel; because the LORD did there confound the language of all the earth: and from thence did the LORD scatter them abroad upon the face of all the earth.<br><a name="10">10</a>. These [are] the generations of Shem: Shem [was] an hundred years old, and begat Arphaxad two years after the flood:<br><a name="11">11</a>  And Shem lived after he begat Arphaxad five hundred years, and begat sons and daughters.<br><a name="12">12</a>  And Arphaxad lived five and thirty years, and begat Salah:<br><a name="13">13</a>  And Arphaxad lived after he begat Salah four hundred and three years, and begat sons and daughters.<br><a name="14">14</a>  And Salah lived thirty years, and begat Eber:<br><a name="15">15</a>  And Salah lived after he begat Eber four hundred and three years, and begat sons and daughters.<br><a name="16">16</a>  And Eber lived four and thirty years, and begat Peleg:<br><a name="17">17</a>  And Eber lived after he begat Peleg four hundred and thirty years, and begat sons and daughters.<br><a name="18">18</a>  And Peleg lived thirty years, and begat Reu:<br><a name="19">19</a>  And Peleg lived after he begat Reu two hundred and nine years, and begat sons and daughters.<br><a name="20">20</a>  And Reu lived two and thirty years, and begat Serug:<br><a name="21">21</a>  And Reu lived after he begat Serug two hundred and seven years, and begat sons and daughters.<br><a name="22">22</a>  And Serug lived thirty years, and begat Nahor:<br><a name="23">23</a>  And Serug lived after he begat Nahor two hundred years, and begat sons and daughters.<br><a name="24">24</a>  And Nahor lived nine and twenty years, and begat Terah:<br><a name="25">25</a>  And Nahor lived after he begat Terah an hundred and nineteen years, and begat sons and daughters.<br><a name="26">26</a>  And Terah lived seventy years, and begat Abram, Nahor, and Haran.<br><a name="27">27</a>. Now these [are] the generations of Terah: Terah begat Abram, Nahor, and Haran; and Haran begat Lot.<br><a name="28">28</a>  And Haran died before his father Terah in the land of his nativity, in Ur of the Chaldees.<br><a name="29">29</a>  And Abram and Nahor took them wives: the name of Abram's wife [was] Sarai; and the name of Nahor's wife, Milcah, the daughter of Haran, the father of Milcah, and the father of Iscah.<br><a name="30">30</a>  But Sarai was barren; she [had] no child.<br><a name="31">31</a>  And Terah took Abram his son, and Lot the son of Haran his son's son, and Sarai his daughter in law, his son Abram's wife; and they went forth with them from Ur of the Chaldees, to go into the land of Canaan; and they came unto Haran, and dwelt there.<br><a name="32">32</a>  And the days of Terah were two hundred and five years: and Terah died in Haran.<br><br>Go to <a href="gen12.htm#1">Genesis 12</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
