Psalms  83<br>1. A Song [or] Psalm of Asaph. Keep not thou silence, O God: hold not thy peace, and be not still, O God.<br><a name="2">2</a>  For, lo, thine enemies make a tumult: and they that hate thee have lifted up the head.<br><a name="3">3</a>  They have taken crafty counsel against thy people, and consulted against thy hidden ones.<br><a name="4">4</a>  They have said, Come, and let us cut them off from [being] a nation; that the name of Israel may be no more in remembrance.<br><a name="5">5</a>  For they have consulted together with one consent: they are confederate against thee:<br><a name="6">6</a>  The tabernacles of Edom, and the Ishmaelites; of Moab, and the Hagarenes;<br><a name="7">7</a>  Gebal, and Ammon, and Amalek; the Philistines with the inhabitants of Tyre;<br><a name="8">8</a>  Assur also is joined with them: they have holpen the children of Lot. Selah.<br><a name="9">9</a>. Do unto them as [unto] the Midianites; as [to] Sisera, as [to] Jabin, at the brook of Kison:<br><a name="10">10</a>  [Which] perished at Endor: they became [as] dung for the earth.<br><a name="11">11</a>  Make their nobles like Oreb, and like Zeeb: yea, all their princes as Zebah, and as Zalmunna:<br><a name="12">12</a>  Who said, Let us take to ourselves the houses of God in possession.<br><a name="13">13</a>  O my God, make them like a wheel; as the stubble before the wind.<br><a name="14">14</a>  As the fire burneth a wood, and as the flame setteth the mountains on fire;<br><a name="15">15</a>  So persecute them with thy tempest, and make them afraid with thy storm.<br><a name="16">16</a>  Fill their faces with shame; that they may seek thy name, O LORD.<br><a name="17">17</a>  Let them be confounded and troubled for ever; yea, let them be put to shame, and perish:<br><a name="18">18</a>  That [men] may know that thou, whose name alone [is] JEHOVAH, [art] the most high over all the earth.<br><br>Go to <a href="psa84.htm#1">Psalm 84</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
