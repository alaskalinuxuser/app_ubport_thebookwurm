Isaiah  43<br> 1. But now thus saith the LORD that created thee, O Jacob, and he that formed thee, O Israel, Fear not: for I have redeemed thee, I have called [thee] by thy name; thou [art] mine.<br><a name="2">2</a>  When thou passest through the waters, I [will be] with thee; and through the rivers, they shall not overflow thee: when thou walkest through the fire, thou shalt not be burned; neither shall the flame kindle upon thee.<br><a name="3">3</a>  For I [am] the LORD thy God, the Holy One of Israel, thy Saviour: I gave Egypt [for] thy ransom, Ethiopia and Seba for thee.<br><a name="4">4</a>  Since thou wast precious in my sight, thou hast been honourable, and I have loved thee: therefore will I give men for thee, and people for thy life.<br><a name="5">5</a>  Fear not: for I [am] with thee: I will bring thy seed from the east, and gather thee from the west;<br><a name="6">6</a>  I will say to the north, Give up; and to the south, Keep not back: bring my sons from far, and my daughters from the ends of the earth;<br><a name="7">7</a>  [Even] every one that is called by my name: for I have created him for my glory, I have formed him; yea, I have made him.<br><a name="8">8</a>. Bring forth the blind people that have eyes, and the deaf that have ears.<br><a name="9">9</a>  Let all the nations be gathered together, and let the people be assembled: who among them can declare this, and shew us former things? let them bring forth their witnesses, that they may be justified: or let them hear, and say, [It is] truth.<br><a name="10">10</a>  Ye [are] my witnesses, saith the LORD, and my servant whom I have chosen: that ye may know and believe me, and understand that I [am] he: before me there was no God formed, neither shall there be after me.<br><a name="11">11</a>  I, [even] I, [am] the LORD; and beside me [there is] no saviour.<br><a name="12">12</a>  I have declared, and have saved, and I have shewed, when [there was] no strange [god] among you: therefore ye [are] my witnesses, saith the LORD, that I [am] God.<br><a name="13">13</a>  Yea, before the day [was] I [am] he; and [there is] none that can deliver out of my hand: I will work, and who shall let it?<br><a name="14">14</a>. Thus saith the LORD, your redeemer, the Holy One of Israel; For your sake I have sent to Babylon, and have brought down all their nobles, and the Chaldeans, whose cry [is] in the ships.<br><a name="15">15</a>  I [am] the LORD, your Holy One, the creator of Israel, your King.<br><a name="16">16</a>  Thus saith the LORD, which maketh a way in the sea, and a path in the mighty waters;<br><a name="17">17</a>  Which bringeth forth the chariot and horse, the army and the power; they shall lie down together, they shall not rise: they are extinct, they are quenched as tow.<br><a name="18">18</a>  Remember ye not the former things, neither consider the things of old.<br><a name="19">19</a>  Behold, I will do a new thing; now it shall spring forth; shall ye not know it? I will even make a way in the wilderness, [and] rivers in the desert.<br><a name="20">20</a>  The beast of the field shall honour me, the dragons and the owls: because I give waters in the wilderness, [and] rivers in the desert, to give drink to my people, my chosen.<br><a name="21">21</a>  This people have I formed for myself; they shall shew forth my praise.<br><a name="22">22</a>. But thou hast not called upon me, O Jacob; but thou hast been weary of me, O Israel.<br><a name="23">23</a>  Thou hast not brought me the small cattle of thy burnt offerings; neither hast thou honoured me with thy sacrifices. I have not caused thee to serve with an offering, nor wearied thee with incense.<br><a name="24">24</a>  Thou hast bought me no sweet cane with money, neither hast thou filled me with the fat of thy sacrifices: but thou hast made me to serve with thy sins, thou hast wearied me with thine iniquities.<br><a name="25">25</a>  I, [even] I, [am] he that blotteth out thy transgressions for mine own sake, and will not remember thy sins.<br><a name="26">26</a>  Put me in remembrance: let us plead together: declare thou, that thou mayest be justified.<br><a name="27">27</a>  Thy first father hath sinned, and thy teachers have transgressed against me.<br><a name="28">28</a>  Therefore I have profaned the princes of the sanctuary, and have given Jacob to the curse, and Israel to reproaches.<br><br>Go to <a href="isa44.htm#1">Isaiah 44</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
