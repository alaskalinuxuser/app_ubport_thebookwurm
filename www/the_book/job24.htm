Job  24<br>1. Why, seeing times are not hidden from the Almighty, do they that know him not see his days?<br><a name="2">2</a>  [Some] remove the landmarks; they violently take away flocks, and feed [thereof].<br><a name="3">3</a>  They drive away the ass of the fatherless, they take the widow's ox for a pledge.<br><a name="4">4</a>  They turn the needy out of the way: the poor of the earth hide themselves together.<br><a name="5">5</a>  Behold, [as] wild asses in the desert, go they forth to their work; rising betimes for a prey: the wilderness [yieldeth] food for them [and] for [their] children.<br><a name="6">6</a>  They reap [every one] his corn in the field: and they gather the vintage of the wicked.<br><a name="7">7</a>  They cause the naked to lodge without clothing, that [they have] no covering in the cold.<br><a name="8">8</a>  They are wet with the showers of the mountains, and embrace the rock for want of a shelter.<br><a name="9">9</a>  They pluck the fatherless from the breast, and take a pledge of the poor.<br><a name="10">10</a>  They cause [him] to go naked without clothing, and they take away the sheaf [from] the hungry;<br><a name="11">11</a>  [Which] make oil within their walls, [and] tread [their] winepresses, and suffer thirst.<br><a name="12">12</a>  Men groan from out of the city, and the soul of the wounded crieth out: yet God layeth not folly [to them].<br><a name="13">13</a>. They are of those that rebel against the light; they know not the ways thereof, nor abide in the paths thereof.<br><a name="14">14</a>  The murderer rising with the light killeth the poor and needy, and in the night is as a thief.<br><a name="15">15</a>  The eye also of the adulterer waiteth for the twilight, saying, No eye shall see me: and disguiseth [his] face.<br><a name="16">16</a>  In the dark they dig through houses, [which] they had marked for themselves in the daytime: they know not the light.<br><a name="17">17</a>  For the morning [is] to them even as the shadow of death: if [one] know [them, they are in] the terrors of the shadow of death.<br><a name="18">18</a>. He [is] swift as the waters; their portion is cursed in the earth: he beholdeth not the way of the vineyards.<br><a name="19">19</a>  Drought and heat consume the snow waters: [so doth] the grave [those which] have sinned.<br><a name="20">20</a>  The womb shall forget him; the worm shall feed sweetly on him; he shall be no more remembered; and wickedness shall be broken as a tree.<br><a name="21">21</a>  He evil entreateth the barren [that] beareth not: and doeth not good to the widow.<br><a name="22">22</a>  He draweth also the mighty with his power: he riseth up, and no [man] is sure of life.<br><a name="23">23</a>  [Though] it be given him [to be] in safety, whereon he resteth; yet his eyes [are] upon their ways.<br><a name="24">24</a>  They are exalted for a little while, but are gone and brought low; they are taken out of the way as all [other], and cut off as the tops of the ears of corn.<br><a name="25">25</a>  And if [it be] not [so] now, who will make me a liar, and make my speech nothing worth?<br><br>Go to <a href="job25.htm#1">Job 25</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
