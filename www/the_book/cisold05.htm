<b>Volume 4, Lesson 5</b><br>
by C.I. Scofield
<h2>The Chosen Family, Part II</h2>
<h3><i>True and False Heirs</i></h3></center>
<p>The Abrahamic covenant introduces a new dispensation of promise. It must be remembered that this concerns the Abrahamic family, and that the blessings of the promises reach the Gentile only through Abraham and his seed (see <a href="eph2.htm#11">Ephesians 2:11,12</a>; <a href="gal3.htm#6">Galatians 3:6-9</a>; <a href="rom11.htm#13">Romans 11:13-21</a>). The great Gentile world goes on under the Adamic covenant (<a href="gen3.htm#14">Genesis 3:14-19</a>, and the covenant with Noah (<a href="gen9.htm#1">Genesis 9:1-7</a>). From <a href="gen12.htm#1">Genesis 12</a> to the end of that book, we have the story of the Abrahamic family. As a narrative, it concerns Abraham's son, Isaac, his grandson, Jacob, and twelve great grandsons, the offspring of Jacob. Throughout the history of Abraham's family, false heirs were rejected.</p>

<li>Eliezer<ul>

<li><a href="gen21.htm#1">Genesis 21:1-14</a> -- &quot;Hagar... and the child... and sent her away.&quot; The bondwoman and her son were cast out.
<li><a href="gal4.htm#22">Galatians 4:22,23</a> -- &quot;He of the freewoman was by promise.&quot;<br>Contrast the law, a system of bondage that was typified by Ishmael, and grace, a system of freedom that was typified by Isaac.</ul>
<li>Esau<ul>
<li><a href="gen25.htm#19">Genesis 25:19-34</a> -- &quot;[Esau] sold his birthright unto Jacob&quot;</ul></ol><b>
<li>Jacob becomes the heir</b><ul>
<li><a href="gen28.htm#10">Genesis 28:10-19</a> -- &quot;The land whereon thou liest, to thee will I give it, and to thy seed.&quot; The ladder vision was Jacob's confirmation of the covenant.
<li><a href="gen32.htm#28">Genesis 32:28</a> -- &quot;Thy name shall be called no more Jacob, but Israel.&quot; Jacob, the &quot;supplanter,&quot; becomes &quot;Israel,&quot; a prince with God.</ul></ol>
