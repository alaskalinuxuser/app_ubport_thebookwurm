Habakkuk   3<br> 1. A prayer of Habakkuk the prophet upon Shigionoth.<br><a name="2">2</a>  O LORD, I have heard thy speech, [and] was afraid: O LORD, revive thy work in the midst of the years, in the midst of the years make known; in wrath remember mercy.<br><a name="3">3</a>. God came from Teman, and the Holy One from mount Paran. Selah. His glory covered the heavens, and the earth was full of his praise.<br><a name="4">4</a>  And [his] brightness was as the light; he had horns [coming] out of his hand: and there [was] the hiding of his power.<br><a name="5">5</a>  Before him went the pestilence, and burning coals went forth at his feet.<br><a name="6">6</a>  He stood, and measured the earth: he beheld, and drove asunder the nations; and the everlasting mountains were scattered, the perpetual hills did bow: his ways [are] everlasting.<br><a name="7">7</a>  I saw the tents of Cushan in affliction: [and] the curtains of the land of Midian did tremble.<br><a name="8">8</a>  Was the LORD displeased against the rivers? [was] thine anger against the rivers? [was] thy wrath against the sea, that thou didst ride upon thine horses [and] thy chariots of salvation?<br><a name="9">9</a>  Thy bow was made quite naked, [according] to the oaths of the tribes, [even thy] word. Selah. Thou didst cleave the earth with rivers.<br><a name="10">10</a>  The mountains saw thee, [and] they trembled: the overflowing of the water passed by: the deep uttered his voice, [and] lifted up his hands on high.<br><a name="11">11</a>  The sun [and] moon stood still in their habitation: at the light of thine arrows they went, [and] at the shining of thy glittering spear.<br><a name="12">12</a>  Thou didst march through the land in indignation, thou didst thresh the heathen in anger.<br><a name="13">13</a>  Thou wentest forth for the salvation of thy people, [even] for salvation with thine anointed; thou woundedst the head out of the house of the wicked, by discovering the foundation unto the neck. Selah.<br><a name="14">14</a>  Thou didst strike through with his staves the head of his villages: they came out as a whirlwind to scatter me: their rejoicing [was] as to devour the poor secretly.<br><a name="15">15</a>  Thou didst walk through the sea with thine horses, [through] the heap of great waters.<br><a name="16">16</a>. When I heard, my belly trembled; my lips quivered at the voice: rottenness entered into my bones, and I trembled in myself, that I might rest in the day of trouble: when he cometh up unto the people, he will invade them with his troops.<br><a name="17">17</a>  Although the fig tree shall not blossom, neither [shall] fruit [be] in the vines; the labour of the olive shall fail, and the fields shall yield no meat; the flock shall be cut off from the fold, and [there shall be] no herd in the stalls:<br><a name="18">18</a>  Yet I will rejoice in the LORD, I will joy in the God of my salvation.<br><a name="19">19</a>  The LORD God [is] my strength, and he will make my feet like hinds' [feet], and he will make me to walk upon mine high places.
