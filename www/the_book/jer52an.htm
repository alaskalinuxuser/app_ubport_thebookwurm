<dl><dt><b>The Fall of Jerusalem in Retrospect,</b> ch. 52
<dt>I. The fall of the city, <a href="jer52.htm#1" target="lwr_lt">v.1-7</a><dd>
Scripture records the account of Jerusalem's captivity and destruction four times: <a href="jer39.htm#1">Jer 39</a>; Jer 52; <a href="2kin25.htm#1">2Kin 25</a>; <a href="2chr36.htm#1">2Chr 36</a>. This repetition, taken with <a href="mat23.htm#37">Mat 23:37</a> and <a href="luk19.htm#41">Luk 19:41</a> &quot;shews how deeply God loves His people, even when their conduct proves them to be wholly unworthy of being loved.&quot;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Did children act toward a father as Israel acted toward God, they would certainly extinguish all love for themselves in their father's heart. But it is impossible to exhaust the love that fills God's heart.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;But, as in the case of Jerusalem, appalling chastisements must visit aggravated sinfulness (vs.2-3).<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Disobedience to the Word of God ensures hunger, defeat and slavery (vs.4-7). Many in their spiritual experience have had this sad experience.&quot; [in quotes, from GWms]
<dt>II. The fate of Zedekiah, <a href="jer52.htm#8" target="lwr_lt">v.8-11</a><ul>
<li>Zedekiah and his soldiers &quot;were defeated and captured in the very scene of Israel's first victory [Jericho]. So, in the Christian's life, defeat may dishonour a once victorious field when there is a departure from the first love.&quot; [GWms]
<li>Zedekiah's fivefold sentence: [These points are in the words of GWms.]<ol type="1">
<li>The execution of his sons before his eyes
<li>the slaughter of his princes
<li>the loss of his eyes
<li>his degradation to slavery
<li>his condemnation to penal labour for life. (The prison was a house of hard labor. cp. <a href="judg16.htm#21">Judg 16:21</a>)</ol></ul>
<dt>III. The fate of the city, the Temple, the people, <a href="jer52.htm#12" target="lwr_lt">v.12-23</a><ul>
<li>Some imagine a conflict between v.12 and <a href="2kin25.htm#8">2Kin 25:8</a>. A careful reading shows that on the seventh day, he came &quot;unto,&quot; and on the tenth day, he went &quot;into&quot; the city.
<li>Additional detail (omitted in ch. 39) is given here concerning the destruction of the Temple and the deportation of its furnishings and remaining vessels.<ul>
<li>The various types of vessels and tools (v.18,19) were used by the priests in the sacrificial ministry. The word &quot;caldron&quot; (used twice here) is elsewhere translated as pans or pots (eg. <a href="ex27.htm#3">Ex 27:3</a>; <a href="ex38.htm#3">38:3</a>). The pans were used to catch the ashes from the altar. The pots were used to boil meat that was not consumed upon the altar, to provide food for the priests. The bowls and basons were for cleansing.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Note that most of these items were of brass, because most of the gold and silver vessels had already been carried away previously (<a href="2kin24.htm#11">2Kin 24:11-13</a>). Now even the brass would not remain. While the world hoarded their fine metals, the Lord had reserved something of greater value for His people. Brass speaks symbolically of judgment upon sin. At the brazen altar, blood was shed for the remission of sin. At the brazen laver there was cleansing for incidental sin. From the brass pots, the priests were nourished in the service of the Lord. Or, so it would have been, had they desired to serve Him alone, and had they acknowledged their sinfulness and repented of it. But now, the neglected means of cleansing would be taken from them.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even those items which were too heavy to move (the brass pillars, the brass sea and its supporting brass bulls) would be carried away in pieces, though they were &quot;without weight&quot; (<a href="1kin7.htm#47">1Kin 7:47</a>).</ul>
<li>Why is so much detail given to the size and beauty of the two brass pillars (<a href="jer52.htm#21" target="lwr_lt">v.21-23</a>) at such a time as this?<ol type="A">
<li>They were Symbols of the Kingdom -<dd>These great pillars stood on either side of the door of the Temple in Jerusalem. These pillars, constructed by Solomon, more than 400 years earlier (<a href="1kin7.htm#15">1Kin 7:15-22</a>), had an immovable association with the perpetual kingdom of David, which the Lord promised him. There were no similar structures accompanying the Tabernacle in the wilderness, for then God traveled with His people in the pillar of fire by night and of cloud by day. But in the future Kingdom, He will dwell with them (<a href="rev21.htm#3">Rev 21:3</a>).
<li>They were Symbols of the Great King -<ul>
<li>Their names-  &quot;Jachin&quot; {He shall establish} and &quot;Boaz&quot; {In Him is strength} (<a href="1kin7.htm#21">1Kin 7:21</a>).<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Observe these dual aspects of the Lord's relationship to His people: <a href="2the3.htm#3">2The 3:3</a> with <a href="1the5.htm#24">1The 5:24</a>; <a href="1cor1.htm#9">1Cor 1:9</a> with <a href="1cor10.htm#13">10:13</a>
<li>Their construction-<ol type="a">
<li>of molten brass speaks of the One who bore the judgment for our iniquities (<a href="isa53.htm#1">Isa 53</a>).
<li>of imposing size (about 35 feet tall and 18 feet in circumference) and strength (4 inch thick brass) speak of the glory and power of His victory. It is by Him that His people are established to stand before Him. It is by His strength that His people can stand against the attacks of the enemy. 
<li>with intricate ornamentation depicting pomegranates, symbolic of the fruitfulness of those whose lives rest upon and are intertwined with His (<a href="joh15.htm#5">Joh 15:5</a>).<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Taken together, these pillars represent Christ, as He will be in His future kingdom, and as He is now for those whose confidence is in Him alone. But because His people had rejected Him, Babylon robbed them of the glory and power that would have been theirs.</ol></ul></ol></ul>
<dt>IV. The fate of certain individuals, <a href="jer52.htm#24" target="lwr_lt">v.24-27</a><dd>
These men who held important religious, political and military offices were slain.<br>
The account in <a href="2kin25.htm#19">2Kin 25:19</a> mentions five men who had been closely associated with the king, whereas v.25 records seven. The difference may be explained by loss during the long journey from Jerusalem to Riblah.
<dt>V. The captivities of Judah under Nebuchadnezzar, <a href="jer52.htm#27" target="lwr_lt">v.27b-30</a><dd>
The nation, which was carried away in the great captivity of v.27b, suffered multiple partial captivities. Comparing the number of deportees, and the year of Nebuchadnezzar in which they occurred, it appears that the first two minor captivities, mentioned here, occurred about a year before each ofthe two major captivities which marked the start and finish of Zedekiah's reign (cp. v.28 with <a href="2kin24.htm#11">2Kin 24:11-17</a>; cp. <a href="jer52.htm#29" target="lwr_lt">v.29</a> with <a href="jer52.htm#10" target="lwr_lt">v.10-12</a>). The third minor captivity (<a href="jer52.htm#30" target="lwr_lt">v.30</a>) was apparently Nebuchadnezzar's response to the rebellion which deposed Gedaliah whom he had appointed as governor in the land following the fall of Jerusalem (cp. <a href="jer41.htm#17">Jer 41:17,18</a>).
<dt>VI. The elevation and death of Jehoiachin in captivity, <a href="jer52.htm#31" target="lwr_lt">v.31-34</a><dd>
Evil-Merodach {meaning &quot;man of Merodach,&quot; a false god} succeeded Nebuchadnezzar as king of Babylon. [The day of Jehoiachin's elevation differs between v.31 and <a href="2kin25.htm#27">2Kin 25:27</a>. It seems probable that there were two days of preparation before the former prisoner was ready to be presented before the king.] The favor shown to Jehoiachin may have given hope to the captives that the promised restoration would occur in spite of their present sufferings. However, that hope of restoration did not benefit the former king, who died in Babylon, without an heir for the throne of David (cp. <a href="jer22.htm#24">Jer 22:24-30</a>).<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elevation by the world system is a poor substitute for honor from God (<a href="1cor4.htm#5">1Cor 4:5</a>).<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Neither the rebellion of God's people, nor the opposition of the world system, will prevent the Lord from establishing His King and Kingdom (<a href="psa2.htm#1">Psa 2</a>). Yet, today, He grieves for the sorrows of His people (see the Lamentations of Jeremiah).
