Isaiah   3<br>1. For, behold, the Lord, the LORD of hosts, doth take away from Jerusalem and from Judah the stay and the staff, the whole stay of bread, and the whole stay of water,<br><a name="2">2</a>  The mighty man, and the man of war, the judge, and the prophet, and the prudent, and the ancient,<br><a name="3">3</a>  The captain of fifty, and the honourable man, and the counsellor, and the cunning artificer, and the eloquent orator.<br><a name="4">4</a>  And I will give children [to be] their princes, and babes shall rule over them.<br><a name="5">5</a>  And the people shall be oppressed, every one by another, and every one by his neighbour: the child shall behave himself proudly against the ancient, and the base against the honourable.<br><a name="6">6</a>  When a man shall take hold of his brother of the house of his father, [saying], Thou hast clothing, be thou our ruler, and [let] this ruin [be] under thy hand:<br><a name="7">7</a>  In that day shall he swear, saying, I will not be an healer; for in my house [is] neither bread nor clothing: make me not a ruler of the people.<br><a name="8">8</a>  For Jerusalem is ruined, and Judah is fallen: because their tongue and their doings [are] against the LORD, to provoke the eyes of his glory.<br><a name="9">9</a>. The shew of their countenance doth witness against them; and they declare their sin as Sodom, they hide [it] not. Woe unto their soul! for they have rewarded evil unto themselves.<br><a name="10">10</a>  Say ye to the righteous, that [it shall be] well [with him]: for they shall eat the fruit of their doings.<br><a name="11">11</a>  Woe unto the wicked! [it shall be] ill [with him]: for the reward of his hands shall be given him.<br><a name="12">12</a>  [As for] my people, children [are] their oppressors, and women rule over them. O my people, they which lead thee cause [thee] to err, and destroy the way of thy paths.<br><a name="13">13</a>  The LORD standeth up to plead, and standeth to judge the people.<br><a name="14">14</a>  The LORD will enter into judgment with the ancients of his people, and the princes thereof: for ye have eaten up the vineyard; the spoil of the poor [is] in your houses.<br><a name="15">15</a>  What mean ye [that] ye beat my people to pieces, and grind the faces of the poor? saith the Lord GOD of hosts.<br><a name="16">16</a>. Moreover the LORD saith, Because the daughters of Zion are haughty, and walk with stretched forth necks and wanton eyes, walking and mincing [as] they go, and making a tinkling with their feet:<br><a name="17">17</a>  Therefore the Lord will smite with a scab the crown of the head of the daughters of Zion, and the LORD will discover their secret parts.<br><a name="18">18</a>  In that day the Lord will take away the bravery of [their] tinkling ornaments [about their feet], and [their] cauls, and [their] round tires like the moon,<br><a name="19">19</a>  The chains, and the bracelets, and the mufflers,<br><a name="20">20</a>  The bonnets, and the ornaments of the legs, and the headbands, and the tablets, and the earrings,<br><a name="21">21</a>  The rings, and nose jewels,<br><a name="22">22</a>  The changeable suits of apparel, and the mantles, and the wimples, and the crisping pins,<br><a name="23">23</a>  The glasses, and the fine linen, and the hoods, and the vails.<br><a name="24">24</a>  And it shall come to pass, [that] instead of sweet smell there shall be stink; and instead of a girdle a rent; and instead of well set hair baldness; and instead of a stomacher a girding of sackcloth; [and] burning instead of beauty.<br><a name="25">25</a>  Thy men shall fall by the sword, and thy mighty in the war.<br><a name="26">26</a>  And her gates shall lament and mourn; and she [being] desolate shall sit upon the ground.<br><br>Go to <a href="isa4.htm#1">Isaiah 4</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
