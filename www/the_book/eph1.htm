Blessed [be] the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly [places] in Christ:<br><a name="4">4</a>  According as he hath chosen us in him before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and without blame before him in love:<br><a name="5">5</a>  Having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself, according to the good pleasure of his will,<br><a name="6">6</a>  To the praise of the glory of his grace, wherein he hath made us accepted in the beloved.<br><a name="7">7</a>  In whom we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of sins, according to the riches of his grace;<br><a name="8">8</a>  Wherein he hath abounded toward us in all wisdom and prudence;<br><a name="9">9</a>  Having made known unto us the mystery of his will, according to his good pleasure which he hath purposed in himself:<br><a name="10">10</a>  That in the dispensation of the fulness of times he might gather together in one all things in Christ, both which are in heaven, and which are on earth; [even] in him:<br><a name="11">11</a>  In whom also we have obtained an inheritance, being predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the counsel of his own will:<br><a name="12">12</a>  That we should be to the praise of his glory, who first trusted in Christ.<br><a name="13">13</a>  In whom ye also [trusted], after that ye heard the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation: in whom also after that ye believed, ye were sealed with that holy Spirit of promise,<br><a name="14">14</a>  Which is the earnest of our inheritance until the redemption of the purchased possession, unto the praise of his glory.<br><a name="15">15</a>.
