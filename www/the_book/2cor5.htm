For we know that if our earthly house of [this] tabernacle were dissolved, we have a building of God, an house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens.<br><a name="2">2</a>  For in this we groan, earnestly desiring to be clothed upon with our house which is from heaven:<br><a name="3">3</a>  If so be that being clothed we shall not be found naked.<br><a name="4">4</a>  For we that are in [this] tabernacle do groan, being burdened: not for that we would be unclothed, but clothed upon, that mortality might be swallowed up of life.<br><a name="5">5</a>  Now he that hath wrought us for the selfsame thing [is] God, who also hath given unto us the earnest of the Spirit.<br><a name="6">6</a>  Therefore [we are] always confident, knowing that, whilst we are at home in the body, we are absent from the Lord:<br><a name="7">7</a>  (For we walk by faith, not by sight:)<br><a name="8">8</a>  We are confident, [I say], and willing rather to be absent from the body, and to be present with the Lord.<br><a name="9">9</a>  Wherefore we labour, that, whether present or absent, we may be accepted of him.<br><a name="10">10</a>  For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ; that every one may receive the things [done] in [his] body, according to that he hath done, whether [it be] good or bad.<br><a name="11">11</a>  Knowing therefore the terror of the Lord, we persuade men; but we are made manifest unto God; and I trust also are made manifest in your consciences.<br><a name="12">12</a>. For we commend not ourselves again unto you, but give you occasion to glory on our behalf, that ye may have somewhat to [answer] them which glory in appearance, and not in heart.<br><a name="13">13</a>  For whether we be beside ourselves, [it is] to God: or whether we be sober, [it is] for your cause.<br><a name="14">14</a>  For the love of Christ constraineth us; because we thus judge, that if one died for all, then were all dead:<br><a name="15">15</a>  And [that] he died for all, that they which live should not henceforth live unto themselves, but unto him which died for them, and rose again.<br><a name="16">16</a>. Wherefore henceforth know we no man after the flesh: yea, though we have known Christ after the flesh, yet now henceforth know we [him] no more.<br> <a name="17"></a>17  Therefore if any man [be] in Christ, [he is] a new creature: old things are passed away; behold, all things are become new.<br><a name="18">18</a>  And all things [are] of God, who hath reconciled us to himself by Jesus Christ, and hath given to us the ministry of reconciliation;<br><a name="19">19</a>  To wit, that God was in Christ, reconciling the world unto himself, not imputing their trespasses unto them; and hath committed unto us the word of reconciliation.<br><a name="20">20</a>  Now then we are ambassadors for Christ, as though God did beseech [you] by us: we pray [you] in Christ's stead, be ye reconciled to God.<br><a name="21">21</a>  For he hath made him [to be] sin for us, who knew no sin; that we might be made the righteousness of God in him.<br><br>Go to <a href="2cor6.htm#1">II Corinthians 6</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
