Proverbs  27<br>1. Boast not thyself of to morrow; for thou knowest not what a day may bring forth.<br><a name="2">2</a>. Let another man praise thee, and not thine own mouth; a stranger, and not thine own lips.<br><a name="3">3</a>. A stone [is] heavy, and the sand weighty; but a fool's wrath [is] heavier than them both.<br><a name="4">4</a>  Wrath [is] cruel, and anger [is] outrageous; but who [is] able to stand before envy?<br><a name="5">5</a>. Open rebuke [is] better than secret love.<br><a name="6">6</a>  Faithful [are] the wounds of a friend; but the kisses of an enemy [are] deceitful.<br><a name="7">7</a>. The full soul loatheth an honeycomb; but to the hungry soul every bitter thing is sweet.<br><a name="8">8</a>. As a bird that wandereth from her nest, so [is] a man that wandereth from his place.<br><a name="9">9</a>. Ointment and perfume rejoice the heart: so [doth] the sweetness of a man's friend by hearty counsel.<br><a name="10">10</a>  Thine own friend, and thy father's friend, forsake not; neither go into thy brother's house in the day of thy calamity: [for] better [is] a neighbour [that is] near than a brother far off.<br><a name="11">11</a>. My son, be wise, and make my heart glad, that I may answer him that reproacheth me.<br><a name="12">12</a>. A prudent [man] foreseeth the evil, [and] hideth himself; [but] the simple pass on, [and] are punished.<br><a name="13">13</a>. Take his garment that is surety for a stranger, and take a pledge of him for a strange woman.<br><a name="14">14</a>. He that blesseth his friend with a loud voice, rising early in the morning, it shall be counted a curse to him.<br><a name="15">15</a>. A continual dropping in a very rainy day and a contentious woman are alike.<br><a name="16">16</a>  Whosoever hideth her hideth the wind, and the ointment of his right hand, [which] bewrayeth [itself].<br><a name="17">17</a>. Iron sharpeneth iron; so a man sharpeneth the countenance of his friend.<br><a name="18">18</a>. Whoso keepeth the fig tree shall eat the fruit thereof: so he that waiteth on his master shall be honoured.<br><a name="19">19</a>. As in water face [answereth] to face, so the heart of man to man.<br><a name="20">20</a>. Hell and destruction are never full; so the eyes of man are never satisfied.<br><a name="21">21</a>. [As] the fining pot for silver, and the furnace for gold; so [is] a man to his praise.<br><a name="22">22</a>. Though thou shouldest bray a fool in a mortar among wheat with a pestle, [yet] will not his foolishness depart from him.<br><a name="23">23</a>. Be thou diligent to know the state of thy flocks, [and] look well to thy herds.<br><a name="24">24</a>  For riches [are] not for ever: and doth the crown [endure] to every generation?<br><a name="25">25</a>  The hay appeareth, and the tender grass sheweth itself, and herbs of the mountains are gathered.<br><a name="26">26</a>  The lambs [are] for thy clothing, and the goats [are] the price of the field.<br><a name="27">27</a>  And [thou shalt have] goats' milk enough for thy food, for the food of thy household, and [for] the maintenance for thy maidens.<br><br>Go to <a href="pro28.htm#1">Proverbs 28</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
