<b><i>7:1  After these things Jesus walked in Galilee: for he would not walk in Jewry</i></b> {ie., in Judaea}<b><i>,<br>
because the Jews sought to kill him.</i></b>{cp. <a href="joh5.htm#18">5:18</a>}<br>
<b><i>7:2  Now the Jews' feast of tabernacles was at hand.</i></b></dt><dl>
<dt>after these things- ie., the events of ch. 6, near a Passover (<a href="joh6.htm#4">6:4</a>).
<dt>feast of tabernacles- occurs in the fall, six months after Passover.
<dd>The events recorded in 7:2 through <a href="joh10.htm#21">10:21</a> took place at this feast.<ul>
<li>Jesus has been ministering in Galilee for a year or more, since His last recorded visit to Jerusalem (in <a href="joh5.htm#1">5:1</a>).
<li>six months have elapsed since ch. 6.
<li>six months remain before the Passover at which Jesus would be crucified.</ul>
<dd>The Feast of Tabernacles (tents), also called the Feast of Booths (HB= Succot), and the Feast of Ingathering (see <a href="lev23.htm#33">Lev 23:33-43</a>; <a href="num29.htm#12">Num 29:12-38</a>) is... <ul>
<li>one of three feasts that all Jewish men were required to attend. <a href="ex23.htm#14">Ex 23:14-17</a>; <a href="deu16.htm#16">Deu 16:16</a>
<li>a harvest celebration at the end of the growing season. <a href="lev23.htm#39">Lev 23:39</a>
<li>a memorial of Israel's deliverance from Egypt. <a href="lev23.htm#43">Lev 23:43</a>
<li>prophetic of Israel's future deliverance &amp; restoration by the Messiah. <a href="zech14.htm#16">Zech 14:16-19</a>; <a href="rev21.htm#3">Rev 21:3-6</a><br>The prophetic significance of this feast may have prompted Peter's reaction when he was given a preview of Christ's kingdom glory. <a href="mat17.htm#4">Mat 17:4</a></ul>
<dt>the Jews- This term, as used by John, usually refers to the religious leaders
<dd>in contrast to the 'Jewish people.' While the religious leaders sought to kill Him, some of the people were still considering His claims (cp. <a href="joh7.htm#31" target="lwr_lt">v.31</a>).</dl><dt>
<b><i>7:3  His brethren therefore said unto him, Depart hence, and go into Judaea,<br>
that thy disciples also may see the works that thou doest.<br>
7:4  For [there is] no man [that] doeth any thing in secret,<br>
and he himself seeketh to be known openly.<br>
If thou do these things, shew thyself to the world.<br>
7:5  For neither did his brethren believe in him.</i></b></dt><dl>
<dt>his brethren...- ie., Mary's other children did not believe in Him as the Messiah<dd>(<a href="psa69.htm#8">Psa 69:8</a>; <a href="mat12.htm#46">Mat 12:46</a>; <a href="mat13.htm#55">13:55</a>; <a href="mar3.htm#21">Mark 3:21,31</a>; <a href="joh1.htm#10">Joh 1:10,11</a>), until later (<a href="act1.htm#14">Acts 1:14</a>).
<dt>The advice they offered Him may have been given with a measure of sarcasm, but 
<dd>from the perspective of the natural man, it was sound: If you want your movement  to grow...<ul>
<li>Go into Judaea- ie., the population and political center, for best advertising exposure.
<li>Do nothing in secret... Seek to be known openly... Show yourself to the world.</ul> 
<dd>Jesus did not receive their counsel. His actions (eg., <a href="joh7.htm#10" target="lwr_lt">v.10</a> and <a href="joh7.htm#18" target="lwr_lt">18</a>) would be according to God's wisdom, which is foolishness to the world. <a href="1cor2.htm#14">1Cor 2:14-16</a>; <a href="1cor3.htm#19">3:19</a></dl><dt>
<b><i>7:6  Then Jesus said unto them, My time is not yet come:<br>
but your time is alway ready.<br>
7:7  The world cannot hate you; but me it hateth,<br>
because I testify of it, that the works thereof are evil</i></b> {GK= ponera, wicked, pernicious}<b><i>.<br>
7:8  Go ye up unto this feast:<br>
I go not up yet unto this feast; for my time is not yet full come.</i></b></dt><dl>
<dt>my time is not yet come- This phrase is distinct from 'My hour is not yet come.'<ul>
<li>time- GK= kairos, appointed time, season. This word is used 3x in <a href="joh7.htm#6" target="lwr_lt">v.6-8</a>. (cp. use in <a href="act1.htm#7">Acts 1:7</a>)
<li>hour- GK= hora, a specific time. This word is used wherever Jesus spoke of 'His hour', <br>referring to His sacrificial death on the cross. (<a href="joh2.htm#4">2:4</a>; <a href="joh7.htm#30">7:30</a>
; <a href="joh8.htm#20">8:20</a>; <a href="joh12.htm#23">12:23</a>; <a href="joh13.htm#1">13:1</a>; <a href="joh17.htm#1">17:1</a>)</ul>
<dt>my time... your time...- Whatever Jesus did was according to the Father's direction. <a href="joh5.htm#19">5:19</a>; <a href="joh8.htm#28">8:28,29</a>
<dt>I go not yet up... - He would go up to Jerusalem, but on the Father's time schedule.
<dd>But His earthly brothers were not so constrained and could go up, at any time.
<dt>the world cannot hate you... me it hateth- cp. <a href="joh3.htm#19">3:19,20</a>; <a href="joh15.htm#18">15:18-19</a>; <a href="joh17.htm#14">17:14</a></dl><dt>
<b><i>7:9  When he had said these words unto them, he abode [still] in Galilee.<br>
7:10  But when his brethren were gone up,<br>
then went he also up unto the feast, not openly, but as it were in secret.</i></b></dt><dl>
<dt>in secret - GK= kruptos, secret, hidden, concealed. (also <a href="joh7.htm#4" target="lwr_lt">v.4</a>)
<dd>He did not call attention to Himself. 
<dd>Yet, He did not conceal God's word from the people. cp. <a href="joh7.htm#14" target="lwr_lt">v.14</a>; <a href="psa40.htm#9">Psa 40:9-10</a>; <a href="joh18.htm#20">Joh 18:20</a></dl><dt>
<b><i>7:11  Then the Jews sought him at the feast, and said, Where is he?</b></i> {cp. <a href="joh7.htm#25" target="lwr_lt">v.25</a>; <a href="joh11.htm#56">11:56</a>}<b><i><br>
7:12  And there was much murmuring among the people concerning him:<br>
for some said, He is a good man:<br>
others said, Nay; but he deceiveth the people.<br>
7:13  Howbeit no man spake openly of him for fear of the Jews. </i></b>{ie., the religious leaders, cp. <a href="joh9.htm#22">9:22</a>}</dt><dl>
<dt>murmuring... concerning him- Jesus was 'the issue' at this feast,<dd>even while He was hidden from public view. Popular opinion was widely divided. cp. <a href="joh7.htm#43" target="lwr_lt">v.43</a>; <a href="mat10.htm#32">Mat 10:32-36</a></dl><dt>
<b><i>7:14  Now about the midst of the feast Jesus went up into the temple, and taught.<br>
7:15  And the Jews marvelled, saying,<br>
How knoweth this man letters, having never learned?</i></b> {cp. <a href="psa119.htm#97">Psa 119:97-104</a>}</dt><dl>
<dt>the midst of the feast- The Feast of Tabernacles extends for 7 days and concludes with an eighth day. 
<dd>On or about day 4, Jesus 'suddenly appeared' in the temple. cp. <a href="mal3.htm#1">Mal 3:1</a>
<dt>He... taught- His priority was on the Word of God (not on works, cf. <a href="joh7.htm#3" target="lwr_lt">v.3,4</a>).
<dd>He did not come to <i>prove</i> Himself, but rather to <i>present</i> the Messiah (Himself) who was sent by God, and described by the scriptures.
<dt>never learned- ie., in a rabbinical school (cp. the credentials of Paul, Peter &amp; John, <a href="act22.htm#3">Acts 22:3</a>; <a href="act4.htm#13">4:13</a>).</dl><dt>
<b><i>7:16  Jesus answered them, and said,<br>
My doctrine is not mine, but his that sent me.<br>
7:17  If any man will do his will </i></b>{lit., if any man wills to do His will},<br>
<b><i>he shall know of the doctrine,<br>
whether it be of God, or [whether] I speak of </i></b>{from}<i><b> myself.<br>
7:18  He that speaketh of </i></b>{from}<i><b> himself seeketh his own glory:<br>
but he that seeketh his glory that sent him, the same is true,<br>

7:19  Did not Moses give you the law, and [yet] none of you keepeth the law?<br>
Why go ye about to kill me?</i></b></dt><dl>
<dt>my doctrine is not mine- cp. <a href="deu18.htm#15">Deu 18:15,18,19</a>, &quot;...I will put my words in his mouth...&quot;

<dt>if any man wills to do... he shall know- God reveals His will to those who desire to obey Him.
<dd>Obedience to God's will begins with believing in Christ. <a href="joh6.htm#29">6:29,40</a>
<dd>Understanding of God's will grows in those who sincerely follow Him. cp. <a href="joh8.htm#31">8:31,32</a>; <a href="psa25.htm#9">Psa 25:9-14</a>
<dt>he that seeks {not his own glory} but the glory of Him that sent Him... is true-  cp. <a href="joh8.htm#50">8:50</a>
<dd>Jesus was fully focused on fulfilling the purpose for which the Father commissioned Him.<br>He taught only the Father's message. He sought to do only the Father's will.<br>
He stood in stark contrast to the religious leaders...
<dt>none of you...- ie., you religious leaders, 
<dd>who have received the Law of Moses (<a href="joh7.htm#19" target="lwr_lt">v.19a</a>),<br> 
who consider yourselves experts in the law (<a href="joh7.htm#15" target="lwr_lt">v.15</a>, <a href="joh7.htm#48" target="lwr_lt">48,49</a>), and<br>
who are responsible to teach it and to live according to it (cp. <a href="mat23.htm#2">Mat 23:2,3</a>; <a href="mal2.htm#7">Mal 2:7,8</a>)...
<dt>none of you keepeth the law...- (cp. <a href="rom2.htm#17">Rom 2:17-24</a>)<dd>In fact, they were actively planning to violate <a href="ex20.htm#13">Ex 20:13</a>.
<br>Their will was far from alignment with God's will (<a href="joh7.htm#17" target="lwr_lt">v.17</a>).<br>How could they recognize the true One who stood before them?  <a href="gal3.htm#24">Gal 3:24</a></dl><dt>
<b><i>7:20  The people answered and said,<br>
Thou hast a devil: who goeth about to kill thee?</i></b></dt><dl>
<dt>the people answered- the crowd at large, which included many from other cities, may have been...
<dd>-- unaware of the leaders' plot to kill Jesus, or 
<dd>-- unaware that the teacher to whom they were listening was Jesus. cp. <a href="joh7.htm#25" target="lwr_lt">v.25</a>
<dt>you have a devil {demon}- in other words, 'You are crazy (or, paranoid)...' cp. <a href="joh10.htm#20">10:20</a></dl><dt>
<b><i>7:21  Jesus answered and said unto them,<br>
I have done one work, and ye all marvel.<br>
7:22  Moses therefore gave unto you circumcision;<br>
(not because it is of Moses, but of the fathers;)<br>
and ye on the sabbath day circumcise a man.<br>
7:23  If a man on the sabbath day receive circumcision,<br>
that the law of Moses should not be broken;<br>
are ye angry at me, because I have made a man every whit whole on the sabbath day?<br>
7:24  Judge not according to the appearance, but judge righteous judgment.</i></b></dt><dl>
<dt>I have done one work...- He refers to the healing at Bethesda, during His prior visit to Jerusalem.
<dd>Since that incident, the leaders sought to slay Him for violation of the sabbath (<a href="joh5.htm#1">5:1-16</a>).
<dt>ye on the sabbath day circumcise a man...- The argument, here, is as follows...<ul>
<li>The covenant given to Abraham (who predates Moses) requires that an infant boy be circumcised 8 days after birth.  <a href="gen17.htm#8">Gen 17:8-14</a><br>Moses included circumcision as a requirement of the law. <a href="lev12.htm#3">Lev 12:3</a>
<li>Moses' law  also requires that the sabbath be kept.
<li>If the 'eighth day' falls on a sabbath, circumcision takes precedence over the sabbath,<br>
because it is 'lawful to do good' or 'to save life' on the sabbath. <a href="mar3.htm#4">Mark 3:4</a>
<li>Why, then, is this healing a crime, since it blessed a man's whole body not just a small part?</ul>
<dt>judge not according to 'appearance'- GK= opsis, that which meets the eye, the face.<dd>cp. <a href="deu1.htm#17">Deu 1:17</a>; <a href="deu16.htm#18">16:18,19</a>
<br>In other words, Do not prejudge a case. Do not decide a matter for political advantage.<br>The Messiah's appearance would not attract men to Him. <a href="isa53.htm#2">Isa 53:2</a>
<dt>judge righteous judgment- cp. <a href="joh7.htm#51" target="lwr_lt">v.51</a>; <a href="isa11.htm#1">Isa 11:1-4</a><dd>The religious leaders had misjudged Him for healing on the Sabbath. He was explaining their error, and giving them an opportunity to reconsider.</dl><dt>
<b><i>7:25  Then said some of them of Jerusalem,<br>
Is not this he, whom they seek to kill?<br>
7:26  But, lo, he speaketh boldly, and they say nothing unto him.<br>
Do the rulers know indeed that this is the very Christ?<br>7:27  Howbeit we know this man whence he is:<br>
but when Christ cometh, no man knoweth whence he is.</i></b></dt><dl>
<dt>some... of Jerusalem- At least, some of the residents of Jerusalem<dd>were aware of the leaders' plot. cp. <a href="joh7.htm#20" target="lwr_lt">v.20</a>
<dt>he speaks boldly- cp. <a href="joh7.htm#14" target="lwr_lt">v.14</a>; <a href="psa40.htm#9">Psa 40:9,10</a>
<dt>they say nothing- The leaders' inaction suggested that they had reconsidered Jesus' claims.
<dt>when Christ comes, no man knows {from where he comes}-
<dd>On the other hand, some people thought that their knowledge of Jesus' origins (as having come from Nazareth) disqualified Him as the Messiah.<br>
&quot;The rabbis taught that the Messiah would come from Bethlehem, and then be hidden, no one knew where [as King Joash had been hidden]. <a href="2chr22.htm#11">2Chr 22:11</a>; <a href="2chr23.htm#11">23:11</a>&quot; [GWms]<br>Of course, these things were true of Him, but they had not searched out the facts. <a href="mat2.htm#1">Mat 2:1,2,13-15</a></dl><dt>
<b><i>7:28  Then cried Jesus in the temple as he taught, saying,<br>
Ye both know me, and ye know whence I am:<br>
and I am not come of myself, but he that sent me is true,<br>
whom ye know not.<br>
7:29  But I know him: for I am from him, and he hath sent me.<br>
7:30  Then they sought to take him:<br>
but no man laid hands on him, because his hour was not yet come.</i></b></dt><dl>
<dt>ye know... ye know not...-
<dd>&quot;Ye know Me as Jesus of Nazareth;<br>
and yet you do not know Me, for you do not know Him that sent Me;<br>
but I am from Him, and He that sent Me is true.&quot; [paraphrase by GWms]
<dt>he that sent me is true- ie., trustworthy, reliable, (in contrast to the ambivalent leaders)
<dt>he hath sent me.- Jesus is...<ul><li>the One<i> sent out </i>from the Father {GK= pempo, <a href="joh7.htm#28" target="lwr_lt">v.28</a>, cp. <a href="joh5.htm#23">5:23</a>}, and 
<li>the One<i> sent on a mission </i>by the Father {GK= apostello, <a href="joh7.htm#29" target="lwr_lt">v.29</a>, cp. <a href="joh5.htm#36">5:36</a>}.</ul>
<dt>they sought to take him- 'take' is GK= piazo, to apprehend, to arrest (also used in <a href="joh7.htm#32" target="lwr_lt">v.32,44</a>).
<dt>no man laid hands on him.. his hour was not yet come.-<dd>The hour of His sacrifice would not be determined by man. cp. <a href="joh10.htm#17">10:17,18</a></dl><dt>
<b><i>7:31  And many of the people believed on him, and said,<br>
When Christ cometh, will he do more miracles than these which this [man] hath done?<br>
7:32  The Pharisees heard that the people murmured such things concerning him;<br>
and the Pharisees and the chief priests sent officers to take him.</i></b>
<dd>The leaders could not tolerate public opinion in favor of Jesus. They took action.<dt>
<b><i>7:33  Then said Jesus unto them,<br>
Yet a little while am I with you, and [then] I go unto him that sent me.<br>
7:34  Ye shall seek me, and shall not find [me]:<br>
and where I am, [thither] ye cannot come.<br>
7:35  Then said the Jews among themselves,<br>
Whither will he go, that we shall not find him?<br>
will he go unto the dispersed among the Gentiles, and teach the Gentiles?<br>
7:36  What [manner of] saying is this that he said,<br>
Ye shall seek me, and shall not find [me]: and where I am, [thither] ye cannot come?</i></b></dt><dl>
<dt>yet a little while am I with you- for a limited time, and inspite of their desire to destroy Him,
<dd>the One sent from the Father (<a href="joh7.htm#28" target="lwr_lt">v.28,29</a>; cp. <a href="joh5.htm#23">5:23</a>) would continue to tabernacle with His people.

<dt>ye shall seek me...- After His departure, Israel would seek vainly for...<dd><ol type="a">

<dt>will he go unto the dispersed...? - ie., to the Jewish people, who were scattered
<dd>among the Gentile nations, by the historic captivities of Israel. cp. <a href="jam1.htm#1">James 1:1</a><br>
They doubted that He would be able to hide from them. Yet, He was hidden already from their eyes.</dl><dt><a name="37"></a>
<b><i>7:37  In the last day, that great [day] of the feast,<br>
Jesus stood and cried, saying, If any man thirst, let him come unto me, and drink.<br>

out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water.<br>
7:39  (But this spake he of the Spirit, which they that believe on him should receive:<br>
for the Holy Ghost was not yet [given]; because that Jesus was not yet glorified.)</i></b></dt><dl>
<dt>the great day of the feast- the seventh day, is called the 'Great Hosanna' (HB, Hoshanna Rabba)
<dd>because of the use of prayers beginning with the word 'Hosanna' (meaning 'save now') and the singing of 'the Hallel' (Psalms 113 through 118; see <a href="psa118.htm#25">118:25-29</a>).<br>On this seventh day, the celebrations reached their high point of significance and joy (the number 7 speaks of completion and fulfillment).<br>While the second Temple stood, a special ceremony took place on each of the 7 feast days-- A priest, in procession with trumpeters and singers, went from the temple to the Pool of Siloam (cp. the significance of this name, <a href="joh9.htm#7">9:7</a>, with <a href="joh7.htm#28" target="lwr_lt">v.28,29</a>). At this pool, he filled a ceremonial pitcher with water and then returned to the temple, where the water was poured out at the altar of sacrifice, as the singers voiced the words of <a href="isa12.htm#3">Isa 12:3</a>.<dd>This ceremony...<ul><li>remembered the water from the rock in the wilderness. <a href="ex17.htm#6">Ex 17:6</a>; <a href="num20.htm#8">Num 20:8-11</a>; <a href="psa78.htm#15">Psa 78:15,16</a><li>anticipated the time when the Lord, tabernacling among His people, would provide waters of life to the world. <a href="zech13.htm#1">Zech 13:1</a>; <a href="zech14.htm#3">14:3,4,8</a>; <a href="rev21.htm#3">Rev 21:3-6</a></ul>
<dd>It was, as this ceremony came to its climactic conclusion, that Jesus' voice resounded in the temple courts:
<dt>if any man thirst, let him come unto me and drink...-  cp. <a href="isa44.htm#3">Isa 44:3</a>; <a href="isa55.htm#1">55:1</a>

<li>freewill ('let him come...'), cp. <a href="joh6.htm#37">6:37b,40</a>
<li>personal participation ('...and drink. He that believeth...' <a href="joh7.htm#37" target="lwr_lt">7:37,38</a>).<br>To drink of Him is to believe on Him. cp. <a href="joh6.htm#47">6:47</a></ul>
<dt>out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water-  The source of this flow is not the believer, 
<dd>but it is the Lord, from Whom the believer drinks, and by Whom the believer is continually supplied. cp. <a href="joh4.htm#14">4:14</a>. See also <a href="isa12.htm#3">Isa 12:3</a>; <a href="isa55.htm#1">55:1</a>; <a href="isa58.htm#11">58:11</a>.

and they said unto them, Why have ye not brought him?</b></i> {cp. <a href="joh7.htm#32" target="lwr_lt">v.32</a>}<b><i><br>
7:46  The officers answered, Never man spake like this man.</i></b></dt><dl>
<dt>Never man spake...- lit., 'Never spoke thus a man.' [TBKC] -
<dd>Their report implies...<ul>
<li>An observation - He speaks with unusual authority. <a href="mat7.htm#28">Mat 7:28,29</a>
<li>A question - Could He be more than a man?</ul></dl><dt>
<b><i>7:47  Then answered them the Pharisees, Are ye also deceived?<br>
7:48  Have any of the rulers or of the Pharisees believed on him?<br>
7:49  But this people who knoweth not the law are cursed.</i></b></dt><dl>
<dt>the rulers and the Pharisees -<ul><li>were educated in the scriptures (cp. <a href="joh7.htm#15" target="lwr_lt">v.15</a>),
<li>were charged with teaching the law to the people (cp. <a href="joh7.htm#49" target="lwr_lt">v.49</a>),
<li>dangerously elevated their own authority above that of scripture. cp. <a href="joh7.htm#48" target="lwr_lt">v.48</a>; <a href="isa29.htm#11">Isa 29:11-19</a></ul>
<dt>have any of the rulers... believed...?-  some had, many would. cp. <a href="joh12.htm#42">12:42</a>; <a href="joh19.htm#38">19:38,39</a>; <a href="act6.htm#7">Acts 6:7</a></dl><dt>
<b><i>7:50  Nicodemus saith unto them, (he that came to Jesus by night, being one of them,)<br>
7:51  Doth our law judge [any] man, before it hear him, and know what he doeth?<br>
7:52  They answered and said unto him, Art thou also of Galilee?<br>
Search, and look: for out of Galilee ariseth no prophet.</i></b></dt><dl>
<dt>Nicodemus- who had gone to Jesus with questions (<a href="joh3.htm#1">3:1 f</a>), and had taken time to 'hear Him,'
<dd>suggested that the assembly of rulers do the same, in keeping with the law (cp. <a href="joh7.htm#24" target="lwr_lt">v.24</a>; <a href="deu1.htm#16">Deu 1:16,17</a>; <a href="pro18.htm#13">Prov 18:13</a>). 
<dt>search and look... out of Galilee ariseth no prophet- They dismissed Jesus' claims out of hand. 
<dd>He was disqualified according to their 'superior knowledge' of scripture.<br>
But in truth, they did not know God's Word (cp. <a href="isa9.htm#1">Isa 9:1,2,6,7</a> with <a href="mat4.htm#13">Mat 4:13-16</a>; also <a href="joh7.htm#16" target="lwr_lt">John 7:16,17</a>),<br>
and they did not know Him. He had made Himself available (<a href="joh7.htm#33" target="lwr_lt">v.33</a>), but they did not want to know Him (<a href="joh7.htm#28" target="lwr_lt">v.28,29</a>). Any of them could have enquired of Him privately (as Nicodemus had once done). Yet, they refused their own counsel to &quot;search and look&quot; {GK=eido, to discern, to discover, to perceive} (cp. <a href="joh5.htm#39">Joh 5:39</a>). Therefore, He would remain unknown to them. The truth concerning Him, like His presence at the feast, was not presented ostentatiously, but &quot;as it were in secret&quot; (<a href="joh7.htm#10" target="lwr_lt">v.10</a>), to be discovered by those who thirsted for it (<a href="joh7.htm#37" target="lwr_lt">v.37</a>).</dl><dt>
<b><i>7:53  And every man went unto his own house.<br>

<dt>Note the movement here--
<dd>-- they, away from Him. - - He, away from them.
<dd>-- they, to their private lives. - - He, toward the place of a future appointment.
<dt>At the mount of Olives, Israel will eventually recognize Him, at His second coming.<dd><a href="zech12.htm#10">Zech 12:10</a>; <a href="zech13.htm#1">13:1</a>; <a href="zech14.htm#4">14:4</a>
