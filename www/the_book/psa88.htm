Psalms  88<br>1. A Song [or] Psalm for the sons of Korah, to the chief Musician upon Mahalath Leannoth, Maschil of Heman the Ezrahite. O LORD God of my salvation, I have cried day [and] night before thee:<br><a name="2">2</a>  Let my prayer come before thee: incline thine ear unto my cry;<br><a name="3">3</a>  For my soul is full of troubles: and my life draweth nigh unto the grave.<br><a name="4">4</a>  I am counted with them that go down into the pit: I am as a man [that hath] no strength:<br><a name="5">5</a>  Free among the dead, like the slain that lie in the grave, whom thou rememberest no more: and they are cut off from thy hand.<br><a name="6">6</a>  Thou hast laid me in the lowest pit, in darkness, in the deeps.<br><a name="7">7</a>  Thy wrath lieth hard upon me, and thou hast afflicted [me] with all thy waves. Selah.<br><a name="8">8</a>  Thou hast put away mine acquaintance far from me; thou hast made me an abomination unto them: [I am] shut up, and I cannot come forth.<br><a name="9">9</a>  Mine eye mourneth by reason of affliction: LORD, I have called daily upon thee, I have stretched out my hands unto thee.<br><a name="10">10</a>. Wilt thou shew wonders to the dead? shall the dead arise [and] praise thee? Selah.<br><a name="11">11</a>  Shall thy lovingkindness be declared in the grave? [or] thy faithfulness in destruction?<br><a name="12">12</a>  Shall thy wonders be known in the dark? and thy righteousness in the land of forgetfulness?<br><a name="13">13</a>  But unto thee have I cried, O LORD; and in the morning shall my prayer prevent thee.<br><a name="14">14</a>  LORD, why castest thou off my soul? [why] hidest thou thy face from me?<br><a name="15">15</a>  I [am] afflicted and ready to die from [my] youth up: [while] I suffer thy terrors I am distracted.<br><a name="16">16</a>  Thy fierce wrath goeth over me; thy terrors have cut me off.<br><a name="17">17</a>  They came round about me daily like water; they compassed me about together.<br><a name="18">18</a>  Lover and friend hast thou put far from me, [and] mine acquaintance into darkness.<br><br>Go to <a href="psa89.htm#1">Psalm 89</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
