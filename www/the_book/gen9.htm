Genesis   9<br>1. And God blessed Noah and his sons, and said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth.<br><a name="2">2</a>  And the fear of you and the dread of you shall be upon every beast of the earth, and upon every fowl of the air, upon all that moveth [upon] the earth, and upon all the fishes of the sea; into your hand are they delivered.<br><a name="3">3</a>  Every moving thing that liveth shall be meat for you; even as the green herb have I given you all things.<br><a name="4">4</a>  But flesh with the life thereof, [which is] the blood thereof, shall ye not eat.<br><a name="5">5</a>  And surely your blood of your lives will I require; at the hand of every beast will I require it, and at the hand of man; at the hand of every man's brother will I require the life of man.<br><a name="6">6</a>  Whoso sheddeth man's blood, by man shall his blood be shed: for in the image of God made he man.<br><a name="7">7</a>  And you, be ye fruitful, and multiply; bring forth abundantly in the earth, and multiply therein.<br><a name="8">8</a>. And God spake unto Noah, and to his sons with him, saying,<br><a name="9">9</a>  And I, behold, I establish my covenant with you, and with your seed after you;<br><a name="10">10</a>  And with every living creature that [is] with you, of the fowl, of the cattle, and of every beast of the earth with you; from all that go out of the ark, to every beast of the earth.<br><a name="11">11</a>  And I will establish my covenant with you; neither shall all flesh be cut off any more by the waters of a flood; neither shall there any more be a flood to destroy the earth.<br><a name="12">12</a>. And God said, This [is] the token of the covenant which I make between me and you and every living creature that [is] with you, for perpetual generations:<br><a name="13">13</a>  I do set my bow in the cloud, and it shall be for a token of a covenant between me and the earth.<br><a name="14">14</a>  And it shall come to pass, when I bring a cloud over the earth, that the bow shall be seen in the cloud:<br><a name="15">15</a>  And I will remember my covenant, which [is] between me and you and every living creature of all flesh; and the waters shall no more become a flood to destroy all flesh.<br><a name="16">16</a>  And the bow shall be in the cloud; and I will look upon it, that I may remember the everlasting covenant between God and every living creature of all flesh that [is] upon the earth.<br><a name="17">17</a>  And God said unto Noah, This [is] the token of the covenant, which I have established between me and all flesh that [is] upon the earth.<br><a name="18">18</a>. And the sons of Noah, that went forth of the ark, were Shem, and Ham, and Japheth: and Ham [is] the father of Canaan.<br><a name="19">19</a>  These [are] the three sons of Noah: and of them was the whole earth overspread.<br><a name="20">20</a>  And Noah began [to be] an husbandman, and he planted a vineyard:<br><a name="21">21</a>  And he drank of the wine, and was drunken; and he was uncovered within his tent.<br><a name="22">22</a>  And Ham, the father of Canaan, saw the nakedness of his father, and told his two brethren without.<br><a name="23">23</a>  And Shem and Japheth took a garment, and laid [it] upon both their shoulders, and went backward, and covered the nakedness of their father; and their faces [were] backward, and they saw not their father's nakedness.<br><a name="24">24</a>. And Noah awoke from his wine, and knew what his younger son had done unto him.<br><a name="25">25</a>  And he said, Cursed [be] Canaan; a servant of servants shall he be unto his brethren.<br><a name="26">26</a>  And he said, Blessed [be] the LORD God of Shem; and Canaan shall be his servant.<br><a name="27">27</a>  God shall enlarge Japheth, and he shall dwell in the tents of Shem; and Canaan shall be his servant.<br><a name="28">28</a>. And Noah lived after the flood three hundred and fifty years.<br><a name="29">29</a>  And all the days of Noah were nine hundred and fifty years: and he died.<br><br>Go to <a href="gen10.htm#1">Genesis 10</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
