Mark  12<br>1. And he began to speak unto them by parables. A [certain] man planted a vineyard, and set an hedge about [it], and digged [a place for] the winefat, and built a tower, and let it out to husbandmen, and went into a far country.<br><a name="2">2</a>  And at the season he sent to the husbandmen a servant, that he might receive from the husbandmen of the fruit of the vineyard.<br><a name="3">3</a>  And they caught [him], and beat him, and sent [him] away empty.<br><a name="4">4</a>  And again he sent unto them another servant; and at him they cast stones, and wounded [him] in the head, and sent [him] away shamefully handled.<br><a name="5">5</a>  And again he sent another; and him they killed, and many others; beating some, and killing some.<br><a name="6">6</a>  Having yet therefore one son, his wellbeloved, he sent him also last unto them, saying, They will reverence my son.<br><a name="7">7</a>  But those husbandmen said among themselves, This is the heir; come, let us kill him, and the inheritance shall be ours.<br><a name="8">8</a>  And they took him, and killed [him], and cast [him] out of the vineyard.<br><a name="9">9</a>  What shall therefore the lord of the vineyard do? he will come and destroy the husbandmen, and will give the vineyard unto others.<br><a name="10">10</a>  And have ye not read this scripture; The stone which the builders rejected is become the head of the corner:<br><a name="11">11</a>  This was the Lord's doing, and it is marvellous in our eyes?<br><a name="12">12</a>  And they sought to lay hold on him, but feared the people: for they knew that he had spoken the parable against them: and they left him, and went their way.<br><a name="13">13</a>. And they send unto him certain of the Pharisees and of the Herodians, to catch him in [his] words.<br><a name="14">14</a>  And when they were come, they say unto him, Master, we know that thou art true, and carest for no man: for thou regardest not the person of men, but teachest the way of God in truth: Is it lawful to give tribute to Caesar, or not?<br><a name="15">15</a>  Shall we give, or shall we not give? But he, knowing their hypocrisy, said unto them, Why tempt ye me? bring me a penny, that I may see [it].<br><a name="16">16</a>  And they brought [it]. And he saith unto them, Whose [is] this image and superscription? And they said unto him, Caesar's.<br><a name="17">17</a>  And Jesus answering said unto them, Render to Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and to God the things that are God's. And they marvelled at him.<br><a name="18">18</a>. Then come unto him the Sadducees, which say there is no resurrection; and they asked him, saying,<br><a name="19">19</a>  Master, Moses wrote unto us, If a man's brother die, and leave [his] wife [behind him], and leave no children, that his brother should take his wife, and raise up seed unto his brother.<br><a name="20">20</a>  Now there were seven brethren: and the first took a wife, and dying left no seed.<br><a name="21">21</a>  And the second took her, and died, neither left he any seed: and the third likewise.<br><a name="22">22</a>  And the seven had her, and left no seed: last of all the woman died also.<br><a name="23">23</a>  In the resurrection therefore, when they shall rise, whose wife shall she be of them? for the seven had her to wife.<br><a name="24">24</a>  And Jesus answering said unto them, Do ye not therefore err, because ye know not the scriptures, neither the power of God?<br><a name="25">25</a>  For when they shall rise from the dead, they neither marry, nor are given in marriage; but are as the angels which are in heaven.<br><a name="26">26</a>  And as touching the dead, that they rise: have ye not read in the book of Moses, how in the bush God spake unto him, saying, I [am] the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob?<br><a name="27">27</a>  He is not the God of the dead, but the God of the living: ye therefore do greatly err.<br><a name="28">28</a>. And one of the scribes came, and having heard them reasoning together, and perceiving that he had answered them well, asked him, Which is the first commandment of all?<br><a name="29">29</a>  And Jesus answered him, The first of all the commandments [is], Hear, O Israel; The Lord our God is one Lord:<br><a name="30">30</a>  And thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind, and with all thy strength: this [is] the first commandment.<br><a name="31">31</a>  And the second [is] like, [namely] this, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself. There is none other commandment greater than these.<br><a name="32">32</a>  And the scribe said unto him, Well, Master, thou hast said the truth: for there is one God; and there is none other but he:<br><a name="33">33</a>  And to love him with all the heart, and with all the understanding, and with all the soul, and with all the strength, and to love [his] neighbour as himself, is more than all whole burnt offerings and sacrifices.<br><a name="34">34</a>  And when Jesus saw that he answered discreetly, he said unto him, Thou art not far from the kingdom of God. And no man after that durst ask him [any question].<br><a name="35">35</a>. And Jesus answered and said, while he taught in the temple, How say the scribes that Christ is the Son of David?<br><a name="36">36</a>  For David himself said by the Holy Ghost, The LORD said to my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, till I make thine enemies thy footstool.<br><a name="37">37</a>  David therefore himself calleth him Lord; and whence is he [then] his son? And the common people heard him gladly.<br><a name="38">38</a>  And he said unto them in his doctrine, Beware of the scribes, which love to go in long clothing, and [love] salutations in the marketplaces,<br><a name="39">39</a>  And the chief seats in the synagogues, and the uppermost rooms at feasts:<br><a name="40">40</a>  Which devour widows' houses, and for a pretence make long prayers: these shall receive greater damnation.<br><a name="41">41</a>. And Jesus sat over against the treasury, and beheld how the people cast money into the treasury: and many that were rich cast in much.<br><a name="42">42</a>  And there came a certain poor widow, and she threw in two mites, which make a farthing.<br><a name="43">43</a>  And he called [unto him] his disciples, and saith unto them, Verily I say unto you, That this poor widow hath cast more in, than all they which have cast into the treasury:<br><a name="44">44</a>  For all [they] did cast in of their abundance; but she of her want did cast in all that she had, [even] all her living.<br><br>Go to <a href="mar13.htm#1">Mark 13</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
