Proverbs  21<br>1. The king's heart [is] in the hand of the LORD, [as] the rivers of water: he turneth it whithersoever he will.<br><a name="2">2</a>. Every way of a man [is] right in his own eyes: but the LORD pondereth the hearts.<br><a name="3">3</a>. To do justice and judgment [is] more acceptable to the LORD than sacrifice.<br><a name="4">4</a>. An high look, and a proud heart, [and] the plowing of the wicked, [is] sin.<br><a name="5">5</a>. The thoughts of the diligent [tend] only to plenteousness; but of every one [that is] hasty only to want.<br><a name="6">6</a>. The getting of treasures by a lying tongue [is] a vanity tossed to and fro of them that seek death.<br><a name="7">7</a>. The robbery of the wicked shall destroy them; because they refuse to do judgment.<br><a name="8">8</a>. The way of man [is] froward and strange: but [as for] the pure, his work [is] right.<br><a name="9">9</a>. [It is] better to dwell in a corner of the housetop, than with a brawling woman in a wide house.<br><a name="10">10</a>. The soul of the wicked desireth evil: his neighbour findeth no favour in his eyes.<br><a name="11">11</a>. When the scorner is punished, the simple is made wise: and when the wise is instructed, he receiveth knowledge.<br><a name="12">12</a>. The righteous [man] wisely considereth the house of the wicked: [but God] overthroweth the wicked for [their] wickedness.<br><a name="13">13</a>. Whoso stoppeth his ears at the cry of the poor, he also shall cry himself, but shall not be heard.<br><a name="14">14</a>. A gift in secret pacifieth anger: and a reward in the bosom strong wrath.<br><a name="15">15</a>. [It is] joy to the just to do judgment: but destruction [shall be] to the workers of iniquity.<br><a name="16">16</a>. The man that wandereth out of the way of understanding shall remain in the congregation of the dead.<br><a name="17">17</a>. He that loveth pleasure [shall be] a poor man: he that loveth wine and oil shall not be rich.<br><a name="18">18</a>. The wicked [shall be] a ransom for the righteous, and the transgressor for the upright.<br><a name="19">19</a>. [It is] better to dwell in the wilderness, than with a contentious and an angry woman.<br><a name="20">20</a>. [There is] treasure to be desired and oil in the dwelling of the wise; but a foolish man spendeth it up.<br><a name="21">21</a>. He that followeth after righteousness and mercy findeth life, righteousness, and honour.<br><a name="22">22</a>. A wise [man] scaleth the city of the mighty, and casteth down the strength of the confidence thereof.<br><a name="23">23</a>. Whoso keepeth his mouth and his tongue keepeth his soul from troubles.<br><a name="24">24</a>. Proud [and] haughty scorner [is] his name, who dealeth in proud wrath.<br><a name="25">25</a>. The desire of the slothful killeth him; for his hands refuse to labour.<br><a name="26">26</a>  He coveteth greedily all the day long: but the righteous giveth and spareth not.<br><a name="27">27</a>. The sacrifice of the wicked [is] abomination: how much more, [when] he bringeth it with a wicked mind?<br><a name="28">28</a>. A false witness shall perish: but the man that heareth speaketh constantly.<br><a name="29">29</a>. A wicked man hardeneth his face: but [as for] the upright, he directeth his way.<br><a name="30">30</a>. [There is] no wisdom nor understanding nor counsel against the LORD.<br><a name="31">31</a>  The horse [is] prepared against the day of battle: but safety [is] of the LORD.<br><br>Go to <a href="pro22.htm#1">Proverbs 22</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
