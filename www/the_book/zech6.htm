Zechariah   6<br> 1. And I turned, and lifted up mine eyes, and looked, and, behold, there came four chariots out from between two mountains; and the mountains [were] mountains of brass.<br><a name="2">2</a>  In the first chariot [were] red horses; and in the second chariot black horses;<br><a name="3">3</a>  And in the third chariot white horses; and in the fourth chariot grisled and bay horses.<br><a name="4">4</a>  Then I answered and said unto the angel that talked with me, What [are] these, my lord?<br><a name="5">5</a>  And the angel answered and said unto me, These [are] the four spirits of the heavens, which go forth from standing before the Lord of all the earth.<br><a name="6">6</a>  The black horses which [are] therein go forth into the north country; and the white go forth after them; and the grisled go forth toward the south country.<br><a name="7">7</a>  And the bay went forth, and sought to go that they might walk to and fro through the earth: and he said, Get you hence, walk to and fro through the earth. So they walked to and fro through the earth.<br><a name="8">8</a>  Then cried he upon me, and spake unto me, saying, Behold, these that go toward the north country have quieted my spirit in the north country.<br><a name="9">9</a>. And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,<br><a name="10">10</a>  Take of [them of] the captivity, [even] of Heldai, of Tobijah, and of Jedaiah, which are come from Babylon, and come thou the same day, and go into the house of Josiah the son of Zephaniah;<br><a name="11">11</a>  Then take silver and gold, and make crowns, and set [them] upon the head of Joshua the son of Josedech, the high priest;<br><a name="12">12</a>  And speak unto him, saying, Thus speaketh the LORD of hosts, saying, Behold the man whose name [is] The BRANCH; and he shall grow up out of his place, and he shall build the temple of the LORD:<br><a name="13">13</a>  Even he shall build the temple of the LORD; and he shall bear the glory, and shall sit and rule upon his throne; and he shall be a priest upon his throne: and the counsel of peace shall be between them both.<br><a name="14">14</a>  And the crowns shall be to Helem, and to Tobijah, and to Jedaiah, and to Hen the son of Zephaniah, for a memorial in the temple of the LORD.<br><a name="15">15</a>  And they [that are] far off shall come and build in the temple of the LORD, and ye shall know that the LORD of hosts hath sent me unto you. And [this] shall come to pass, if ye will diligently obey the voice of the LORD your God.<br><br>Go to <a href="zech7.htm#1">Zechariah 7</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
