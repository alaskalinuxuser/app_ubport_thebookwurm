Colossians   4<br>1. Masters, give unto [your] servants that which is just and equal; knowing that ye also have a Master in heaven.<br><a name="2">2</a>. Continue in prayer, and watch in the same with thanksgiving;<br><a name="3">3</a>  Withal praying also for us, that God would open unto us a door of utterance, to speak the mystery of Christ, for which I am also in bonds:<br><a name="4">4</a>  That I may make it manifest, as I ought to speak.<br><a name="5">5</a>. Walk in wisdom toward them that are without, redeeming the time.<br><a name="6">6</a>  Let your speech [be] alway with grace, seasoned with salt, that ye may know how ye ought to answer every man.<br><a name="7">7</a>. All my state shall Tychicus declare unto you, [who is] a beloved brother, and a faithful minister and fellowservant in the Lord:<br><a name="8">8</a>  Whom I have sent unto you for the same purpose, that he might know your estate, and comfort your hearts;<br><a name="9">9</a>  With Onesimus, a faithful and beloved brother, who is [one] of you.

These only [are my] fellowworkers unto the kingdom of God, which have been a comfort unto me.<br><a name="12">12</a>  Epaphras, who is [one] of you, a servant of Christ, saluteth you, always labouring fervently for you in prayers, that ye may stand perfect and complete in all the will of God.<br><a name="13">13</a>  For I bear him record, that he hath a great zeal for you, and them [that are] in Laodicea, and them in Hierapolis.<br><a name="14">14</a>  Luke, the beloved physician, and Demas, greet you.<br><a name="15">15</a>  Salute the brethren which are in Laodicea, and Nymphas, and the church which is in his house.<br><a name="16">16</a>  And when this epistle is read among you, cause that it be read also in the church of the Laodiceans; and that ye likewise read the [epistle] from Laodicea.<br><a name="17">17</a>  And say to Archippus, Take heed to the ministry which thou hast received in the Lord, that thou fulfil it.<br><a name="18">18</a>  The salutation by the hand of me Paul.
