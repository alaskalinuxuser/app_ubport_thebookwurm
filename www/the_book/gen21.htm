Genesis  21<br>1. And the LORD visited Sarah as he had said, and the LORD did unto Sarah as he had spoken.<br><a name="2">2</a>  For Sarah conceived, and bare Abraham a son in his old age, at the set time of which God had spoken to him.<br><a name="3">3</a>  And Abraham called the name of his son that was born unto him, whom Sarah bare to him, Isaac.<br><a name="4">4</a>  And Abraham circumcised his son Isaac being eight days old, as God had commanded him.<br><a name="5">5</a>  And Abraham was an hundred years old, when his son Isaac was born unto him.<br><a name="6">6</a>  And Sarah said, God hath made me to laugh, [so that] all that hear will laugh with me.<br><a name="7">7</a>  And she said, Who would have said unto Abraham, that Sarah should have given children suck? for I have born [him] a son in his old age.<br><a name="8">8</a>  And the child grew, and was weaned: and Abraham made a great feast the [same] day that Isaac was weaned.<br><a name="9">9</a>. And Sarah saw the son of Hagar the Egyptian, which she had born unto Abraham, mocking.<br><a name="10">10</a>  Wherefore she said unto Abraham, Cast out this bondwoman and her son: for the son of this bondwoman shall not be heir with my son, [even] with Isaac.<br><a name="11">11</a>  And the thing was very grievous in Abraham's sight because of his son.<br><a name="12">12</a>  And God said unto Abraham, Let it not be grievous in thy sight because of the lad, and because of thy bondwoman; in all that Sarah hath said unto thee, hearken unto her voice; for in Isaac shall thy seed be called.<br><a name="13">13</a>  And also of the son of the bondwoman will I make a nation, because he [is] thy seed.<br><a name="14">14</a>. And Abraham rose up early in the morning, and took bread, and a bottle of water, and gave [it] unto Hagar, putting [it] on her shoulder, and the child, and sent her away: and she departed, and wandered in the wilderness of Beersheba.<br><a name="15">15</a>  And the water was spent in the bottle, and she cast the child under one of the shrubs.<br><a name="16">16</a>  And she went, and sat her down over against [him] a good way off, as it were a bowshot: for she said, Let me not see the death of the child. And she sat over against [him], and lift up her voice, and wept.<br><a name="17">17</a>  And God heard the voice of the lad; and the angel of God called to Hagar out of heaven, and said unto her, What aileth thee, Hagar? fear not; for God hath heard the voice of the lad where he [is].<br><a name="18">18</a>  Arise, lift up the lad, and hold him in thine hand; for I will make him a great nation.<br><a name="19">19</a>  And God opened her eyes, and she saw a well of water; and she went, and filled the bottle with water, and gave the lad drink.<br><a name="20">20</a>  And God was with the lad; and he grew, and dwelt in the wilderness, and became an archer.<br><a name="21">21</a>  And he dwelt in the wilderness of Paran: and his mother took him a wife out of the land of Egypt.<br><a name="22">22</a>. And it came to pass at that time, that Abimelech and Phichol the chief captain of his host spake unto Abraham, saying, God [is] with thee in all that thou doest:<br><a name="23">23</a>  Now therefore swear unto me here by God that thou wilt not deal falsely with me, nor with my son, nor with my son's son: [but] according to the kindness that I have done unto thee, thou shalt do unto me, and to the land wherein thou hast sojourned.<br><a name="24">24</a>  And Abraham said, I will swear.<br><a name="25">25</a>  And Abraham reproved Abimelech because of a well of water, which Abimelech's servants had violently taken away.<br><a name="26">26</a>  And Abimelech said, I wot not who hath done this thing: neither didst thou tell me, neither yet heard I [of it], but to day.<br><a name="27">27</a>  And Abraham took sheep and oxen, and gave them unto Abimelech; and both of them made a covenant.<br><a name="28">28</a>  And Abraham set seven ewe lambs of the flock by themselves.<br><a name="29">29</a>  And Abimelech said unto Abraham, What [mean] these seven ewe lambs which thou hast set by themselves?<br><a name="30">30</a>  And he said, For [these] seven ewe lambs shalt thou take of my hand, that they may be a witness unto me, that I have digged this well.<br><a name="31">31</a>  Wherefore he called that place Beersheba; because there they sware both of them.<br><a name="32">32</a>  Thus they made a covenant at Beersheba: then Abimelech rose up, and Phichol the chief captain of his host, and they returned into the land of the Philistines.<br><a name="33">33</a>. And [Abraham] planted a grove in Beersheba, and called there on the name of the LORD, the everlasting God.<br><a name="34">34</a>  And Abraham sojourned in the Philistines' land many days.<br><br>Go to <a href="gen22.htm#1">Genesis 22</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
