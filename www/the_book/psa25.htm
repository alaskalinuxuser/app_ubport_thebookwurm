Unto thee, O LORD, do I lift up my soul.<br><a name="2">2</a>  O my God, I trust in thee: let me not be ashamed, let not mine enemies triumph over me.<br><a name="3">3</a>  Yea, let none that wait on thee be ashamed: let them be ashamed which transgress without cause.<br><a name="4">4</a>  Shew me thy ways, O LORD; teach me thy paths.<br><a name="5">5</a>  Lead me in thy truth, and teach me: for thou [art] the God of my salvation; on thee do I wait all the day.<br><a name="6">6</a>  Remember, O LORD, thy tender mercies and thy lovingkindnesses; for they [have been] ever of old.<br><a name="7">7</a>  Remember not the sins of my youth, nor my transgressions: according to thy mercy remember thou me for thy goodness' sake, O LORD.<br><a name="8"></a> 8. Good and upright [is] the LORD: therefore will he teach sinners in the way.<br><a name="9">9</a>  The meek will he guide in judgment: and the meek will he teach his way.<br><a name="10">10</a>  All the paths of the LORD [are] mercy and truth unto such as keep his covenant and his testimonies.<br><a name="11">11</a>  For thy name's sake, O LORD, pardon mine iniquity; for it [is] great.<br><a name="12">12</a>  What man [is] he that feareth the LORD? him shall he teach in the way [that] he shall choose.<br><a name="13">13</a>  His soul shall dwell at ease; and his seed shall inherit the earth.<br><a name="14">14</a>  The secret of the LORD [is] with them that fear him; and he will shew them his covenant.<br><a name="15">15</a>. Mine eyes [are] ever toward the LORD; for he shall pluck my feet out of the net.<br><a name="16">16</a>  Turn thee unto me, and have mercy upon me; for I [am] desolate and afflicted.<br><a name="17">17</a>  The troubles of my heart are enlarged: [O] bring thou me out of my distresses.<br><a name="18">18</a>  Look upon mine affliction and my pain; and forgive all my sins.<br><a name="19">19</a>  Consider mine enemies; for they are many; and they hate me with cruel hatred.<br><a name="20">20</a>  O keep my soul, and deliver me: let me not be ashamed; for I put my trust in thee.<br><a name="21">21</a>  Let integrity and uprightness preserve me; for I wait on thee.<br><a name="22">22</a>  Redeem Israel, O God, out of all his troubles.<br><br>Go to <a href="psa26.htm#1">Psalm 26</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
