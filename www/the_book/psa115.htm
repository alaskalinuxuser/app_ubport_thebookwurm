Psalms 115<br> 1. Not unto us, O LORD, not unto us, but unto thy name give glory, for thy mercy, [and] for thy truth's sake.<br><a name="2">2</a>  Wherefore should the heathen say, Where [is] now their God?<br><a name="3">3</a>  But our God [is] in the heavens: he hath done whatsoever he hath pleased.<br><a name="4">4</a>  Their idols [are] silver and gold, the work of men's hands.<br><a name="5">5</a>  They have mouths, but they speak not: eyes have they, but they see not:<br><a name="6">6</a>  They have ears, but they hear not: noses have they, but they smell not:<br><a name="7">7</a>  They have hands, but they handle not: feet have they, but they walk not: neither speak they through their throat.<br><a name="8">8</a>  They that make them are like unto them; [so is] every one that trusteth in them.<br><a name="9">9</a>. O Israel, trust thou in the LORD: he [is] their help and their shield.<br><a name="10">10</a>  O house of Aaron, trust in the LORD: he [is] their help and their shield.<br><a name="11">11</a>  Ye that fear the LORD, trust in the LORD: he [is] their help and their shield.<br><a name="12">12</a>  The LORD hath been mindful of us: he will bless [us]; he will bless the house of Israel; he will bless the house of Aaron.<br><a name="13">13</a>  He will bless them that fear the LORD, [both] small and great.<br><a name="14">14</a>  The LORD shall increase you more and more, you and your children.<br><a name="15">15</a>  Ye [are] blessed of the LORD which made heaven and earth.<br><a name="16">16</a>  The heaven, [even] the heavens, [are] the LORD'S: but the earth hath he given to the children of men.<br><a name="17">17</a>  The dead praise not the LORD, neither any that go down into silence.<br><a name="18">18</a>  But we will bless the LORD from this time forth and for evermore.
