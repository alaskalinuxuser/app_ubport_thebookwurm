Ezekiel  35<br>1. Moreover the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,<br><a name="2">2</a>  Son of man, set thy face against mount Seir, and prophesy against it,<br><a name="3">3</a>  And say unto it, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, O mount Seir, I [am] against thee, and I will stretch out mine hand against thee, and I will make thee most desolate.<br><a name="4">4</a>  I will lay thy cities waste, and thou shalt be desolate, and thou shalt know that I [am] the LORD.<br><a name="5">5</a>  Because thou hast had a perpetual hatred, and hast shed [the blood of] the children of Israel by the force of the sword in the time of their calamity, in the time [that their] iniquity [had] an end:<br><a name="6">6</a>  Therefore, [as] I live, saith the Lord GOD, I will prepare thee unto blood, and blood shall pursue thee: sith thou hast not hated blood, even blood shall pursue thee.<br><a name="7">7</a>  Thus will I make mount Seir most desolate, and cut off from it him that passeth out and him that returneth.<br><a name="8">8</a>  And I will fill his mountains with his slain [men]: in thy hills, and in thy valleys, and in all thy rivers, shall they fall that are slain with the sword.<br><a name="9">9</a>  I will make thee perpetual desolations, and thy cities shall not return: and ye shall know that I [am] the LORD.<br><a name="10">10</a>. Because thou hast said, These two nations and these two countries shall be mine, and we will possess it; whereas the LORD was there:<br><a name="11">11</a>  Therefore, [as] I live, saith the Lord GOD, I will even do according to thine anger, and according to thine envy which thou hast used out of thy hatred against them; and I will make myself known among them, when I have judged thee.<br><a name="12">12</a>  And thou shalt know that I [am] the LORD, [and that] I have heard all thy blasphemies which thou hast spoken against the mountains of Israel, saying, They are laid desolate, they are given us to consume.<br><a name="13">13</a>  Thus with your mouth ye have boasted against me, and have multiplied your words against me: I have heard [them].<br><a name="14">14</a>  Thus saith the Lord GOD; When the whole earth rejoiceth, I will make thee desolate.<br><a name="15">15</a>  As thou didst rejoice at the inheritance of the house of Israel, because it was desolate, so will I do unto thee: thou shalt be desolate, O mount Seir, and all Idumea, [even] all of it: and they shall know that I [am] the LORD.<br><br>Go to <a href="eze36.htm#1">Ezekiel 36</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
