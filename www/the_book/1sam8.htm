1Samuel   8<br>1. And it came to pass, when Samuel was old, that he made his sons judges over Israel.<br><a name="2">2</a>  Now the name of his firstborn was Joel; and the name of his second, Abiah: [they were] judges in Beersheba.<br><a name="3">3</a>  And his sons walked not in his ways, but turned aside after lucre, and took bribes, and perverted judgment.<br><a name="4">4</a>. Then all the elders of Israel gathered themselves together, and came to Samuel unto Ramah,<br><a name="5">5</a>  And said unto him, Behold, thou art old, and thy sons walk not in thy ways: now make us a king to judge us like all the nations.<br><a name="6">6</a>  But the thing displeased Samuel, when they said, Give us a king to judge us. And Samuel prayed unto the LORD.<br><a name="7">7</a>  And the LORD said unto Samuel, Hearken unto the voice of the people in all that they say unto thee: for they have not rejected thee, but they have rejected me, that I should not reign over them.<br><a name="8">8</a>  According to all the works which they have done since the day that I brought them up out of Egypt even unto this day, wherewith they have forsaken me, and served other gods, so do they also unto thee.<br><a name="9">9</a>  Now therefore hearken unto their voice: howbeit yet protest solemnly unto them, and shew them the manner of the king that shall reign over them.<br><a name="10">10</a>  And Samuel told all the words of the LORD unto the people that asked of him a king.<br><a name="11">11</a>  And he said, This will be the manner of the king that shall reign over you: He will take your sons, and appoint [them] for himself, for his chariots, and [to be] his horsemen; and [some] shall run before his chariots.<br><a name="12">12</a>  And he will appoint him captains over thousands, and captains over fifties; and [will set them] to ear his ground, and to reap his harvest, and to make his instruments of war, and instruments of his chariots.<br><a name="13">13</a>  And he will take your daughters [to be] confectionaries, and [to be] cooks, and [to be] bakers.<br><a name="14">14</a>  And he will take your fields, and your vineyards, and your oliveyards, [even] the best [of them], and give [them] to his servants.<br><a name="15">15</a>  And he will take the tenth of your seed, and of your vineyards, and give to his officers, and to his servants.<br><a name="16">16</a>  And he will take your menservants, and your maidservants, and your goodliest young men, and your asses, and put [them] to his work.<br><a name="17">17</a>  He will take the tenth of your sheep: and ye shall be his servants.<br><a name="18">18</a>  And ye shall cry out in that day because of your king which ye shall have chosen you; and the LORD will not hear you in that day.<br><a name="19">19</a>  Nevertheless the people refused to obey the voice of Samuel; and they said, Nay; but we will have a king over us;<br><a name="20">20</a>  That we also may be like all the nations; and that our king may judge us, and go out before us, and fight our battles.<br><a name="21">21</a>  And Samuel heard all the words of the people, and he rehearsed them in the ears of the LORD.<br><a name="22">22</a>  And the LORD said to Samuel, Hearken unto their voice, and make them a king. And Samuel said unto the men of Israel, Go ye every man unto his city.<br><br>Go to <a href="1sam9.htm#1">I Samuel 9</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
