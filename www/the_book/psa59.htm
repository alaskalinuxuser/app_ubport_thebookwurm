Psalms  59<br>1. To the chief Musician, Altaschith, Michtam of David; when Saul sent, and they watched the house to kill him. Deliver me from mine enemies, O my God: defend me from them that rise up against me.<br><a name="2">2</a>  Deliver me from the workers of iniquity, and save me from bloody men.<br><a name="3">3</a>  For, lo, they lie in wait for my soul: the mighty are gathered against me; not [for] my transgression, nor [for] my sin, O LORD.<br><a name="4">4</a>  They run and prepare themselves without [my] fault: awake to help me, and behold.<br><a name="5">5</a>  Thou therefore, O LORD God of hosts, the God of Israel, awake to visit all the heathen: be not merciful to any wicked transgressors. Selah.<br><a name="6">6</a>  They return at evening: they make a noise like a dog, and go round about the city.<br><a name="7">7</a>  Behold, they belch out with their mouth: swords [are] in their lips: for who, [say they], doth hear?<br><a name="8">8</a>. But thou, O LORD, shalt laugh at them; thou shalt have all the heathen in derision.<br><a name="9">9</a>  [Because of] his strength will I wait upon thee: for God [is] my defence.<br><a name="10">10</a>  The God of my mercy shall prevent me: God shall let me see [my desire] upon mine enemies.<br><a name="11">11</a>  Slay them not, lest my people forget: scatter them by thy power; and bring them down, O Lord our shield.<br><a name="12">12</a>  [For] the sin of their mouth [and] the words of their lips let them even be taken in their pride: and for cursing and lying [which] they speak.<br><a name="13">13</a>  Consume [them] in wrath, consume [them], that they [may] not [be]: and let them know that God ruleth in Jacob unto the ends of the earth. Selah.<br><a name="14">14</a>  And at evening let them return; [and] let them make a noise like a dog, and go round about the city.<br><a name="15">15</a>  Let them wander up and down for meat, and grudge if they be not satisfied.<br><a name="16">16</a>  But I will sing of thy power; yea, I will sing aloud of thy mercy in the morning: for thou hast been my defence and refuge in the day of my trouble.<br><a name="17">17</a>  Unto thee, O my strength, will I sing: for God [is] my defence, [and] the God of my mercy.<br><br>Go to <a href="psa60.htm#1">Psalm 60</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
