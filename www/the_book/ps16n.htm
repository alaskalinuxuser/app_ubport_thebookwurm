<b><a href="psa16.htm#1" target="lwr_lt">PSALM 16</a> - The Resurrection of the Messiah</b><br><dl><dt>
<i><b>16:1 Michtam of David. </b></i></dt><dl>
<dt>Michtam- the meaning is uncertain. Its derivation could be from one of several root words. 
<dd>Suggested meanings: a writing, an engraving, golden, hidden, precious, secret.
<dd>A Suggested Title: <i>The Psalm of the Precious Secret </i>[CHS] 
<dt>This Psalm is a prayer. We do not know what may have moved David to pray in this way. 
<dd>However, both Peter &amp; Paul quote this Psalm in reference to Christ's resurrection. 
<dd>- - Peter says that David spoke as a prophet, in <a href="act2.htm#25">&quot;Acts 2:25-32&quot;</a>.
<dd>- - Paul quotes this Psalm, in <a href="act13.htm#32">Acts 13:32-&quot;35&quot;-37</a>.
<dd>Notice that the quoted verses, like the entire Psalm, are voiced in the first person. The prophetic picture is of Jesus Christ communing with the Father, in confident surrender to His perfect Will, as the hour of His crucifixion drew near. Since this Psalm is one continuous prayer, we will consider the entire Psalm as a prayer of Christ. The believer, who is aware that he has been crucified and raised with Christ (<a href="rom6.htm#3">Rom 6:3,4</a>), will find much to learn from our Lord's obedience of faith (<a href="heb5.htm#7">Heb 5:7-9</a>).</dl><dt>&nbsp;
<dt><i><b>Preserve me, O God: for in thee do I put my trust. </b></i></dt><dl>
<dt>Preserve me...- {HB= shamar, keep, tend, watch over}
<dd>The Lord preserved Israel in their wanderings. (<a href="josh24.htm#17">Josh 24:17</a>)
<dd>Job addressed God: &quot;O thou Preserver of men.&quot; (<a href="job7.htm#20">Job 7:20</a>)
<dd>Believers are &quot;sanctified... preserved in Christ Jesus, and called&quot; (<a href="jude1.htm#1">Jude 1:1</a>).
<dd>- - But the One calling upon God, here, is the Lord Jesus... perhaps in Gethsemane.<br>Consider the Father's answer to the Son's request in <a href="isa49.htm#8">Isa 49:8</a>, and context <a href="isa49.htm#4">49:4-10</a>.
<dd>Here we have a glimpse into the heart of &quot;He that hath mercy&quot; on us. 
<dt>O God - HB= &quot;El&quot;: the Mighty God, the One with power to deliver. 
<dt>my trust - ie., my confidence, my refuge, the One to whom I flee.
<dd>When we sincerely rest by faith in God's mercy, we may rest assured. [CHS]
<dd>cp. <a href="psa17.htm#6">Psa 17:6,7</a>; <a href="psa18.htm#2">18:2</a></dl>
<dt><b><i>16:2 [O my soul], thou hast said unto the LORD</b></i> {Jehovah, the everliving One},<br><b><i>
Thou [art] my Lord </b></i>{Adonai, Master}: </dt><dl>
<dt>Christ lived in perfect submission to His Father. He humbled Himself... 
<dd><a href="php2.htm#6">Php 2:6-8</a>; <a href="joh5.htm#30">Joh 5:30</a>; <a href="mat26.htm#39">Mat 26:39</a></dl>
<dt><i><b>my goodness [extendeth] not to thee; </b></i>{or: I have no good apart from thee.}</dt><dl>
<dt>Christ's righteous life and obedience unto death...
<dd>-- was not for God's benefit. cp. <a href="job22.htm#2">Job 22:2,3</a>; <a href="luk17.htm#10">Luk 17:10</a>
<dd>-- did not make God any more righteous or complete.</dl>
<dt><b><i>16:3 [But] to the saints that [are] in the earth,<br>
and [to] the excellent, in whom [is] all my delight. </b></i></dt><dl>
<dt>but to the saints - the holy ones, the set apart ones (cp. <a href="1cor1.htm#2">1Cor 1:2</a>) .
<dt>Christ's goodness extends to us.-<dd>He is our righteousness. In Him we are made righteous. <a href="1cor1.htm#30">1Cor 1:30</a>;  <a href="2cor5.htm#21">2Cor 5:21</a>
<dt>the excellent - a title expressing splendor &amp; majesty. 
<dt>my delight - a title expressing the pleasure of the beholder in the one beheld. 
<dd>Both terms apply first and foremost to our Lord Jesus Christ
<dd>(cp. <a href="psa8.htm#1">Psa 8:1</a>; <a href="heb1.htm#4">Heb 1:4</a>; <a href="isa42.htm#1">Isa 42:1</a>; <a href="2pet1.htm#17">2Pet 1:17</a>),
<dd>and secondly to His Bride who shares:<ul>
<li>His Name, which is Excellent. 
<li>His Father's pleasure, My Delight. 
<li>His Home, the excellent Glory.</ul>
<dd>These things do not belong to those who are not &quot;in Him&quot;...</dl>
<dt><i><b>16:4 Their sorrows shall be multiplied [that] hasten [after] another [god]: </b></i></dt><dl>
<dt>sorrows... multiplied...
<dd>- - by the present consequences of eagerly pursuing ungodliness. <a href="gal6.htm#7">Gal 6:7</a>
<dd>- - by the future judgment of God. cp. <a href="judg10.htm#13">Judg 10:13,14</a>; <a href="isa43.htm#10">Isa 43:10-13</a>
<dt>another [god] - Note that the word 'god' was supplied by the translators.
<dd>The idols which men pursue are, in the final analysis, 'nothing in the world.' <a href="1cor8.htm#4">1Cor 8:4-6</a>
<dt>gods - of wood, or stone, or breathing clay cannot save from the wrath of God.</dl>
<dt><i><b>their drink offerings of blood will I not offer,<br> 
nor take up their names into my lips. </b></i></dt><dl>
<dt>Historically, Israel turned from the true God to pursue the heathen gods of their neighbors. 
<dd>They sacrificed their children unto devils, they swore by their names. <a href="josh23.htm#6">Josh 23:6-8</a>; <a href="psa106.htm#34">Psa 106:34-40</a>
<dd>Do we sacrifice our children by abortion, or by abandoning them to worldy ways &amp; wisdom?
<dt>drink offerings of blood... their names...
<dd>Drink offerings were poured out to express the worth of that which was worshipped.<dd>A drink offering of blood would be the pouring out of life itself. <dd>What do I honor with my life? personal wealth... position... pleasure... political causes...?
<dd>Do I have gods that must be put away, before I can expect the Lord to preserve me? <a href="josh24.htm#14">Josh 24:14-17</a>
<dt>The religious leaders, of Jesus' day, sought to pour out His blood because they served such false gods. 
<dd>cp. <a href="joh8.htm#37">Joh 8:37-38, 42-44</a>; <a href="joh11.htm#47">11:47-50</a>
<dt>Today, few seek the Kingdom of God and His righteousness, thinking the cost is too high (eg., <a href="mat19.htm#22">Mat 19:22-24</a>).
<dd>God's way is not without sorrows. But these will not last, for He will lift them away in due time. <a href="2cor4.htm#17">2Cor 4:17,18</a> 
<dt>Jesus also was tempted, in all points as we are tempted, by the god of this world: 
<dd>&quot;All these things will I give thee, if thou wilt...  worship me&quot; (<a href="mat4.htm#8">Mat 4:8,9</a>).
<dd>But He had only His Father's Name on His lips (<a href="mat4.htm#10">Mat 4:10</a>).</dl>
<dt><i><b>16:5 The LORD [is] the portion of mine inheritance and of my cup:</b></i></dt><dl> 
<dt>The LORD is... my portion...-
<dd>In the Father, the Son possessed all things. cp. <a href="psa2.htm#8">Psa 2:8</a>; <a href="joh16.htm#15">Joh 16:15</a>; <a href="joh17.htm#4">17:5</a>
<dd>In Him, the believer's portion is beyond estimation. <a href="psa73.htm#25">Psa 73:25,26</a>; <a href="1cor2.htm#9">1Cor 2:9</a>
<dt>my inheritance - my sure possession, which endures beyond present difficulties, even beyond death.
<dd>In Him, the believer has secure treasure, though, in this life, his lot may be empty and hopeless. cp. <a href="gen15.htm#1">Gen 15:1</a>; <a href="1pet1.htm#3">1Pet 1:3-5</a>
<dt>my cup - that part of God's provision, of which I partake, at this time.
<dd>The cup which Jesus drank, in our behalf, was bitter beyond what we will ever know. <a href="luk22.htm#41">Luk 22:41-44</a>
<dd>Yet, knowing the Father, whose will is perfect, He drank, committing Himself to the One who is His portion. <a href="mat26.htm#42">Mat 26:42</a>
<dd>So we, who are in Him, may confidently look beyond our present trials, to the faithful One, who transcends time. <a href="heb12.htm#2">Heb 12:2</a></dl>
<dt><i><b>thou maintainest my lot.</b></i> </dt><dl>
<dt>my lot - my portion, that which falls to me by rights. <a href="psa2.htm#6">Psa 2:6</a>; <a href="psa9.htm#4">9:4</a>; <a href="psa118.htm#6">118:6,7</a>; <a href="isa49.htm#4">Isa 49:4</a></dl>
<dt><b><i>
16:6 The lines are fallen unto me in pleasant [places];<br>
yea, I have a goodly heritage.</b></i> </dt><dl>
<dt>lines - the &quot;surveying cords&quot; which measure out my inheritance. 
<dd>There is no boundary or limitation to His possession (nor to ours, if we are in Him). 
<dd><a href="heb1.htm#1">Heb 1:1,2</a>; <a href="rev21.htm#7">Rev 21:7</a>
<dt>a goodly heritage - His inheritance includes those in whom He delights (cp. <a href="psa16.htm#3" target="lwr_lt">v.3</a>; <a href="eph1.htm#18">Eph 1:18</a>).</dl>
<dt><i><b>16:7 I will bless the LORD, who hath given me counsel:<br>
my reins also instruct me in the night seasons. </b></i></dt><dl>
<dt>counsel - direction, purpose - especially as set forth in God's Word 
<dd>(cp. <a href="psa73.htm#24">Psa 73:24</a>; <a href="eph1.htm#11">Eph 1:11</a>; <a href="heb6.htm#17">Heb 6:17</a>; <a href="act20.htm#27">Acts 20:27</a>).
<dd>The Scriptures, which reveal to us the Anointed One, by whom God's purposes are fulfilled,<br>also provided direction for Him as He walked the path of obedience, as a man.
<dt>reins - inward parts, heart (cp. word usage in <a href="psa73.htm#21">Psa 73:21</a>).
<dt>night seasons - cp: <a href="psa63.htm#5">Psa 63:5-8</a>; <a href="psa119.htm#148">119:148</a>; <a href="isa26.htm#9">Isa 26:9</a>; <a href="luk6.htm#12">Luk 6:12</a>
<dd>The Lord Jesus sought His Father's will in His Word, and in whole nights of prayer. 
<dd>He found what He sought.  The same resource is available to us. (cp. <a href="psa73.htm#24">Psa 73:24</a>) 
<dd>Even when darkness veiled the Father's face (in Gethsemane <a href="psa77.htm#2">Psa 77:2-6</a>; on Calvary <a href="psa22.htm#2">Psa 22:2</a>), 
<dd>our Lord held the course He knew was set for Him. (<a href="isa50.htm#4">Isa 50:4-6</a>; <a href="luk18.htm#31">Luk 18:31-33</a>; <a href="joh8.htm#28">Joh 8:28</a>).</dl>
<dt><b><i>
16:8 I have set the LORD always before me:<br>
because [he is] at my right hand, I shall not be moved. </b></i></dt><dl>
<dt>Compare <a href="psa16.htm#8" target="lwr_lt">v.8-11</a> as quoted in <a href="act2.htm#25">&quot;Acts 2:25-28&quot;</a>. 
<dt>set - [In Acts 2, this word is &quot;foresaw&quot;- to see beforehand, to keep before one's eyes.]
<dd>Jesus had but one object of desire: to please the Father. <a href="joh8.htm#29">Joh 8:29</a>
<dd>cp. <a href="psa27.htm#4">Psa 27:4</a>; <a href="psa73.htm#23">Psa 73:23,26</a>; <a href="psa119.htm#30">119:30</a> (where the word for 'set' is rendered 'laid')
<dd>So, the believer's eyes must always be toward our Lord  (<a href="heb12.htm#2">Heb 12:2</a>).
<dt>because he... I shall not be moved.- 
<dd>The LORD would ensure that Christ fulfilled His purpose 'without deviation' (as an arrow going straight to its mark). 
<dd><a href="psa62.htm#6">Psa 62:6</a>; <a href="psa110.htm#5">110:5</a>; <a href="isa49.htm#2">Isa 49:2</a> </dl>
<dt><b><i>16:9 Therefore my heart is glad, and my glory rejoiceth:<br>
my flesh also shall rest in hope. </b></i></dt><dl>
<dt>glory- HB= kabod: honor, weight, abundance.  
<dd>[In <a href="act2.htm#26">&quot;Acts 2:26&quot;</a>, the word is &quot;tongue&quot;, ie., the organ of praise.] 
<dd>This is equivalent to saying: &quot;All that is within me...&quot; (<a href="psa103.htm#1">Psa 103:1</a>).<br>cp. <a href="psa30.htm#12">Psa 30:12</a>; <a href="psa57.htm#8">57:8</a>; re: Christ <a href="joh17.htm#4">Joh 17:4,5</a> 
<dt>my flesh... shall rest...- refers to the death of the body.
<dt>...in hope.- ie., in confident expectation - cp. the Christian's hope: <a href="1the4.htm#13">1Thes 4:13,14-f</a>.</dl>
<dt><b><i>16:10 For thou wilt not leave my soul in hell;<br>
neither wilt thou suffer thine Holy One to see corruption. </b></i></dt><dl>
<dt>hell - HB= sheol, the grave, the place of the dead. 
<dd>[In <a href="act2.htm#27">&quot;Acts 2:27&quot;</a>, the GK word is 'hades', the grave, the state of consciousness after death.] 
<dt>corruption - the destruction of the flesh, the decay of death.
<dd>David, whose body decomposed after his death, was not writing about himself, but about Christ's resurrection, and ascension into heaven.<br><a href="act13.htm#32">Acts 13:32-&quot;35&quot;-37</a>; <a href="act2.htm#27">Acts 2:&quot;27&quot;-37</a></dl>
<dt><i><b>16:11 Thou wilt shew me the path of life: </b></i></dt><dl>
<dt>[cp. <a href="act2.htm#28">&quot;Acts 2:28&quot;</a>- Thou <i>hast made known</i> to me the ways of life. (past tense)]
<dt>This Psalm anticipated Christ's resurrection. The apostles bore witness to His resurrection.
<dd>Christ has become the firstfruits from the dead. <a href="1cor15.htm#20">1Cor 15:20</a></dl>
<dt><i><b>in thy presence [is] fulness of joy;</b></i></dt><dl>
<dt>[cp. <a href="act2.htm#28">&quot;Acts 2:28&quot;</a>- Thou shalt make me full of joy<i> with thy countenance </i>(ie., face, presence).]</dl>
<dt><i><b>at thy right hand [there are] pleasures for evermore. </b></i></dt><dl>
<dt>True joy &amp; pleasure are found only in His Presence.<dd>The sorrows of death will be forgotten. <a href="psa21.htm#4">Psa 21:4-6</a>
<dd>Because our Lord drank the cup that we deserved, but passed through death into life in the Father's Presence, we, who belong to Him, rejoice in confident expectation of joining Him there. <a href="joh17.htm#24">Joh 17:24</a>; <a href="heb6.htm#19">Heb 6:19,20</a><br><hr width=25% align=center size=1>
<dt>The theme of the Messiah's death and resurrection can be traced through the next several psalms.<dd>Compare the following passages with <a href="psa16.htm#1" target="lwr_lt">Psalm 16</a>...<ul>
<li><a href="psa17.htm#1">Psa 17:1-4, 13-15</a> - The tested One anticipates joy in God's presence.
<li><a href="psa18.htm#1">Psa 18:1-6, 46-50</a> - The Rock -- strength and comfort in the distresses of death;<dd>-- deliverance and exaltation in the power of the One who lives.</dd>
<li><a href="psa19.htm#1">Psa 19</a> - The eternal Word emerges from a &quot;chamber&quot; (v.5).
<li><a href="psa20.htm#6">Psa 20:6</a> - Confidence in the LORD who delivers His Anointed.
<li><a href="psa21.htm#1">Psa 21:1-7</a> - The King in His joy.
