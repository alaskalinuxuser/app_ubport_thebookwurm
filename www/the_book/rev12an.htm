<dl><dt>
Following the sounding of the 7th Trumpet (the third &quot;Woe&quot; <a href="rev8.htm#12">8:12,13</a>), in <a href="rev11.htm#15">11:15</a>, there is an extended parenthetic episode, consisting of several visions (11:15 - 15:4). This parenthetic provides an overview of the conflict, which is behind the scenes of human history and which is central to the judgments of the Day of the Lord. When the parenthetic closes, narration concerning the divine judgment contained in the third &quot;Woe&quot; resumes (at <a href="rev15.htm#5">15:5,6</a>) with the outpouring of God's wrath in the 7 Bowl or Vial judgments, which will bring about the end foretold in <a href="rev11.htm#15">11:15</a>. <dd>The middle chapter of this section focuses on the reign of the antichrist and his prophet (the two beasts of ch. 13), which is itself a great Woe for those who dwell upon the earth (cp. <a href="rev12.htm#12" target="lwr_lt">v.12</a>). Note that two visions of the heavenly Temple, each focusing on the security of God's testimony in heaven, bracket the narrative concerning this terrible time. Though all men believe the lie, God's Word remains sure. Those who trust Him will not be disappointed. (cp. <a href="rev11.htm#19">11:19</a>; <a href="rev15.htm#5">15:5</a>; <a href="psa119.htm#89">Psa 119:89</a>)
<dt>The first section of the parenthetic introduces 7 Personages:
<dd>(1) A Woman clothed with the sun (Israel)
<br>(2) A Dragon (Satan)
<br>(3) A Male Child (Christ)
<br>(4) Michael (the archangel)
<br>(5) the Remnant of Israel which escapes
<br>(6) the Beast out of the sea 
<br>(7) the Beast out of the land.
<br>Most of the above are literal persons (natural or supernatural). The nation of Israel is symbolically depicted, as a woman, in #1 and 5.
<dt>Note that we are at the mid-point of Revelation's 22 chapters.
<dd>It is no coincidence that ch. 11 &amp; 12 focus our attention on Israel.
<br>Remember, the Tribulation is called &quot;the time of Jacob's trouble&quot; (<a href="jer30.htm#7">Jer 30:7</a>).<dt>
<b><i>12:1 And there appeared a great wonder in heaven; <br>
a woman clothed with the sun,<br>
and the moon under her feet,<br>
and upon her head a crown of twelve stars:</i></b></dt><dl>
<dt>a great 'wonder' {lit., sign} in heaven-
<dd>The significance of this &quot;personage&quot; is essential for understanding God's prophetic program.
<dt>Who is this woman? 
<dd>The R.C.C. identifies her as Mary, the mother of Jesus.
<br>Many protestants say she is the Church. 
<br>However, Scripture says she is Israel.<ul>
<li>sun... moon... twelve stars ('twelve' corresponds to the number of Israel's tribes):<dd>Other passages apply these symbols to Israel (eg., <a href="gen37.htm#9">Gen 37:9,10</a>; <a href="jer31.htm#35">Jer 31:35-37</a>).</dd>
<li>The Lord often refers to Israel as a woman in the OT. A few examples:<dd>
<a href="isa54.htm#3">Isa 54:3-7</a>; <a href="jer3.htm#6">Jer 3:6-10</a>; <a href="jer31.htm#32">31:32</a>; <a href="hos3.htm#1">Hos 3:1</a></dd></ul>
<dt>Note: There are 4 &quot;women&quot; in Rev. <dd>These are distinct and must not be confused:<ol type="1">
<li>Jezebel, a source of error in the Church (<a href="rev2.htm#20">2:20</a>).
<li>The Woman clothed with the sun, Israel (ch. 12).
<li>The Woman riding the beast, the great whore, <br>the counterfeit church of the Tribulation.(<a href="rev17.htm#1">17:1-6</a>).
<li>The Bride of Christ (<a href="rev19.htm#7">19:7,8</a>).</ol></dl><dt>
<b><i>12:2 And she being with child cried,<br>
travailing in birth, and pained to be delivered.</i></b></dt><dl>
<dt>The child will be identified at <a href="rev12.htm#5" target="lwr_lt">v.5</a>.
<dt>However, we will see (at v.5) that the birth of the child is not the reason for her travail. Rather, birth pangs &amp; travail describe the experience of Israel during the Tribulation. <dd><a href="jer30.htm#6">Jer 30:6,7</a>; <a href="mat24.htm#21">Mat 24:21</a></dl><dt>
<b><i>12:3 And there appeared another wonder in heaven;<br>
and behold a great red dragon,<br>
having seven heads and ten horns, and seven crowns upon his heads.</i></b></dt><dl>
<dt>another wonder {sign}- whose significance is essential to understanding Rev.
<dt>The Dragon- is clearly identified as the Devil (Satan) in <a href="rev12.htm#9" target="lwr_lt">v.9</a>.
<dt>great- he is the god of this world.
<dd>The kingdoms are under his control (cp. <a href="mat4.htm#8">Mat 4:8,9</a>).
<dt>red- he is a murderer,
<dd>responsible for the martyrdom of countless saints (cp. <a href="joh8.htm#44">Joh 8:44</a>).
<dt>seven heads- speaks of his perfection of wisdom (cp. <a href="eze28.htm#12">Eze 28:12</a>).
<dt>seven heads and ten horns- The heads &amp; horns speak of kings &amp; kingdoms.
<dd>We will discuss these in ch. 13.
<dt>7 crowns- on his 7 heads (in ch. 13, there are 10 crowns on the 10 horns).</dl><dt>
<b><i>12:4 And his tail drew the third part of the stars of heaven,<br>
and did cast them to the earth:</i></b></dt><dl>
<dt>stars of heaven- refer to angels (as elsewhere in Rev. eg., <a href="rev1.htm#20">1:20</a>).
<dd>Satan apparently led a third of the angels in rebellion against God.
<dd>(Review <a href="rev9an.htm#1">9:1,2 notes</a>. cp. <a href="dan8.htm#10">Dan 8:10</a>; <a href="jude1.htm#6">Jude 1:6</a>)</dl>
<b><i>and the dragon stood before the woman which was ready to be delivered,<br>
for to devour her child as soon as it was born.</i></b></dt><dl>
<dt>This child is to be the undoing of Satan. 
<dd>Therefore, Satan desired to destroy Him. <a href="gen3.htm#15">Gen 3:15</a>
<dt>the woman- is best seen as Israel here. 
<dd>Although Mary was the individual woman, who birthed Jesus, many mothers in Israel suffered by the dragon's action against this child. Satan attempted to destroy Jesus through King Herod's slaughter of the innocents (<a href="mat2.htm#16">Mat 2:16</a>). Christ came into the world, through Israel (<a href="rom9.htm#5">Rom 9:5</a>).</dl><dt>
<b><i>12:5 And she brought forth a man </i></b>{male} <b><i>child </i></b>{GK= uios, son}<b><i>,<br>
who was to rule all nations with a rod of iron:<br>
and her child </i></b>{GK= teknon, child}<b><i> was caught up unto God, and [to] his throne.</i></b></dt><dl>
<dt>The child is Jesus Christ, Messiah of Israel. Note:
<dt>-- His dual characterization: a child, a son.
<dd>A child: born to Israel, born of a woman, born a man (human), born under the Law.
<br>A Son: The Son of God, The Son of David, who will occupy David's throne.
<br><a href="isa7.htm#14">Isa 7:14</a>; <a href="isa9.htm#6">9:6,7</a>; <a href="rom9.htm#4">Rom 9:4,5</a>; <a href="gal4.htm#4">Gal 4:4,5</a>
<dt>-- His destiny: to rule all nations (this line alludes to <a href="psa2.htm#8">Psa 2:8,9</a>).
<dt>-- His departure: &quot;Caught up to God&quot; refers to His ascension (cp. <a href="act1.htm#9">Acts 1:9-11</a>).
<dd> This should not be confused with the Rapture of the Church.
<br>- - - Here, the one caught up is the woman's Son.
<br>- - - At the rapture, the one caught up is the Son's Bride.
<br>- - - Also, the Church does not occupy the Father's throne, although they share in Christ's Millennial throne. (cp. &quot;My Father's throne&quot; vs. &quot;My throne,&quot; <a href="rev3.htm#21">3:21</a>).
<dt>Note that there is no travail mentioned in connection with Christ's birth,
<dd>here, or in any passage of scripture on the topic. By the record, it was indeed a &quot;silent night.&quot;
<br>cp. <a href="isa7.htm#14">Isa 7:14</a>; <a href="isa9.htm#6">9:6</a> and also: <a href="mat1.htm#21">Mat 1:21,25</a>; <a href="luk1.htm#31">Luk 1:31</a>; <a href="luk2.htm#7">2:7</a>
<dt>Scripture states that the male child would be born <b><i>before</i></b> Israel's travail.
<dd>(This child is an individual, a literal and physical person, the Messiah.)
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her travail (<a href="rev12.htm#2" target="lwr_lt">v.2</a>) will result in the birth of her child<b><i>ren</i></b> (<a href="isa66.htm#7">Isa 66:7-10</a>). These children represent the corporate figurative spiritual birth of the nation of Israel. [JBS]
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her travail stems from her rejection of God and His Messiah, for which cause He &quot;gave them up,&quot; temporarily and partially, to destruction until they would return to Him. cp. <a href="mic5.htm#2">Mic 5:2,3</a>; <a href="hos5.htm#15">Hos 5:15</a>; <a href="hos6.htm#1">6:1-3</a>; <a href="hos11.htm#1">11:1-9</a></dl><dt>
<b><i>12:6 And the woman fled into the wilderness</i></b> {uninhabited region [Wuest]}<b><i>,<br>
where she hath a place prepared</i></b> {in a state of preparedness [Wuest]} <b><i>of God,<br>
that they should feed her there a thousand two hundred [and] threescore days.</i></b></dt><dl>
<dt>fled- cp. &quot;Then let them which be in Judea flee unto the mountains.&quot; <a href="mat24.htm#15">Mat 24:15,16</a>
<dd>This is at the time of the abomination of desolation, when the antichrist occupies the Temple.
<br>[Mountains and wilderness are not mutually exclusive. cp. <a href="act7.htm#38">Acts 7:38</a>; <a href="lam4.htm#19">Lam 4:19</a>]
<dt>a place- Some say this is the city of Petra. But the location is not identified. cp. <a href="hos2.htm#14">Hos 2:14,15</a>
<dt>feed- Israel will be physically provided for. How? By whom? We are not told.
<dt>1260 days- They will be in this place of refuge for the last half of the 7 year Tribulation.</dl><dt>
<b><i>12:7 And there was war in heaven: <br>
Michael and his angels fought against the dragon;<br>
and the dragon fought and his angels,<br>
12:8 And prevailed not; neither was their place found any more in heaven.</i></b></dt><dl>
<dt>Michael- the archangel who stands in behalf of Israel (cp. <a href="dan12.htm#1">Dan 12:1</a> &amp; <a href="rev10an.htm#1">note at Rev 10:1</a>).
<dd>As a &quot;prince,&quot; Michael has charge over other angels in God's service.
<dt>The Dragon- (ie., Satan) has command of the fallen angels (<a href="rev12.htm#4" target="lwr_lt">v.4</a>).
<dt>war...fought- the language used here implies a single battle (cf. <a href="rev12.htm#17" target="lwr_lt">v.17</a>).
<dt>no place in heaven- Scripture speaks of three distinct &quot;heavens&quot;:<dd><ul>
<li>The 3rd Heaven- Where God dwells. (eg., <a href="2cor12.htm#2">2 Cor 12:2</a>)
<li>The 2nd heaven- Containing sun, moon, stars (eg., <a href="mat24.htm#29">Mat 24:29</a>)
<li>The 1st heaven- Containing clouds &amp; birds (eg., <a href="mat8.htm#20">Mat 8:20</a>; <a href="rev19.htm#17">Rev 19:17</a>)</ul>
<dd>Many see this as Satan being cast out of the 3rd Heaven. However, ever since Satan sinned, he has not been welcome in Heaven, where God's will is done, and where no liars enter. <a href="mat6.htm#9">Mat 6:9,10</a>; <a href="rev21.htm#27">Rev 21:27</a>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bible nowhere states that when Satan sinned, he was cast out of heaven. Rather, it appears that he was on earth (in the Garden of Eden) when he sinned. [JBS] This is also implied by: &quot;I will ascend into heaven... above the...clouds...&quot; <a href="eze28.htm#13">Eze 28:13-18</a>; <a href="isa14.htm#12">Isa 14:12-17</a>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since his fall into sin, Satan has been excluded from the presence of God (the third heaven). His realm has been confined to the environs of earth including the 1st heaven. He is called the &quot;god of this world&quot; and &quot;the prince of the power of the air.&quot; <a href="2cor4.htm#4">2Cor 4:4</a>; <a href="eph2.htm#2">Eph 2:2</a>; cp. <a href="job2.htm#2">Job 2:2</a></dl><dt>
<b><i>12:9 And the great dragon was cast out, that old serpent,<br>
called the Devil, and Satan, which deceiveth the whole world:</i></b></dt><dl>
<dt>that old serpent- 'old' is GK= archaios, ancient, original, primal.
<dd>The very serpent who deceived Adam &amp; Eve. (<a href="gen3.htm#1">Gen 3:1,13</a>)
<dt>the Devil- GK= diablos, slanderer, accuser. Very similar in meaning to:
<dt>Satan- HB= satan, adversary.<ul>
<li>Although Satan does not dwell in Heaven,<dd>he does have sufficient access or audience with God to bring accusation against God's people.<br>cp. <a href="rev12.htm#10" target="lwr_lt">v.10</a> (and related note, below); <a href="job1.htm#6">Job 1:6-12</a>; <a href="job2.htm#1">2:1-7</a></dd>
<li>As God allows, the Adversary seeks to destroy or to hinder God's people.<dd><a href="1pet5.htm#8">1Pet 5:8</a>; <a href="zech3.htm#1">Zech 3:1,2</a></dd></ul>
<dt>who deceives- cp. <a href="joh8.htm#44">Joh 8:44</a>; <a href="2cor4.htm#4">2Cor 4:4</a>; <a href="2joh1.htm#7">2Joh 1:7</a>
<dt>the whole &quot;world&quot;- GK= oikoumene, inhabited earth.</dl><dt>
<b><i>he was cast out into the earth, and his angels were cast out with him.</i></b></dt><dl>
<dt>earth- GK= ge, earth as distinquished from sea or heavens (eg. <a href="mat5.htm#18">Mat 5:18</a>).
<dd>The battle with Michael results in Satan being cast out (of the 1st heaven) into the earth. His activities are now confined to the realm of men. cp. <a href="rev12.htm#12" target="lwr_lt">v.12</a>
<dd>Note: Jesus' statement: &quot;I saw Satan as lightning fall from heaven&quot; (<a href="luk10.htm#18">Luk 10:18</a>), occasioned by His disciple's exercise of power over demons, may be taken prophetically as looking forward to this event.</dl><dt>
<b><i>12:10 And I heard a loud voice saying in heaven, <br>
Now is come salvation,</i></b></dt><dl>
<dt>-- The redemption begun by Christ is about to be brought to completion.
<dd><a href="rom13.htm#11">Rom 13:11</a>; <a href="1pet1.htm#3">1Pet 1:3-5</a>; <a href="1joh3.htm#2">1Joh 3:2</a>
<dt>-- In His death and resurrection, Christ defeated Satan. <a href="joh12.htm#31">Joh 12:31</a>; <a href="joh16.htm#11">16:11</a>
<dd>But Satan's kingdom was allowed to continue for a time.<br>That period is about to be brought to a close.</dl><dt>
<b><i>and strength</i></b> {lit., the power}<i><b>,<br>
and the kingdom of our God,<br>
and the power </i></b>{ie., authority} <b><i>of his Christ:</i></b>
<dd>Now is come... the kingdom- &quot;Thine... the kingdom, and the power...&quot; <a href="mat6.htm#13">Mat 6:13</a><dt>
<b><i>for the accuser of our brethren is cast down,<br>
which accused them before our God day and night.</i></b></dt><dl>
<dt>before- GK= enopion, in His sight.
<dd>See this word in <a href="rev14.htm#10">14:10</a>, where it is translated &quot;in the presence of...&quot;
<br>This word does not require bodily presence, but refers to God's overseeing authority.<br>Satan's torment does not take place in Heaven, but Heaven guarantees that his punishment is executed. Likewise, Satan's accusation of the brethren &quot;before God&quot; does not require his presence in Heaven. 
<dt>day and night- an idiom meaning &quot;unceasingly&quot; (cp. Satan's torment, <a href="rev20.htm#10">20:10</a>)<dd>Although Satan continually spues out accusations against the saints, the Lord limits his audience before Him (appointing the time and place, and setting the agenda) and restricts his actions toward His own. cp. <a href="job1.htm#6">Job 1:6-12</a>; <a href="job2.htm#1">2:1-7</a>
<dt>our brethren- In context, this term primarily refers to the tribulation saints. 
<dd>The praise (<a href="rev12.htm#10" target="lwr_lt">v.10</a>) is offered by the martyred tribulation saints. 
<dd>This is the answer to their prayer (which was also in a loud voice, <a href="rev6.htm#9">6:9-11</a>).</dl><dt>
<b><i>12:11 And they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb,</i></b>
<dd><a href="col1.htm#13">Col 1:13,14</a><dt>
<b><i>and by the word of their testimony </i></b>{GK= marturia, witness}<b><i>;<br>
and they loved not their lives </i></b>{GK= psuche, soul} <b><i>unto the death.</i></b>
<dd>Their witness required a readiness for martyrdom.<br>Their first love was Christ, for whom they willingly poured out their souls (their conscious personal selves) as He had poured out His soul for them.<br>eg., life= soul, in: <a href="mat16.htm#25">Mat 16:25,26</a>; <a href="joh10.htm#11">Joh 10:11,15</a>; <a href="isa53.htm#12">Isa 53:12</a><dt>
<b><i>12:12 Therefore rejoice, [ye] heavens, and ye that dwell</i></b> {tabernacle} <b><i>in them.<br>
Woe to the inhabiters </i></b>{permanently settled} <b><i>of the earth and of the sea!<br>
for </i></b>{because} <b><i>the devil is come down unto you, having great wrath,<br>
because he knoweth that he hath but a short time</i></b> {Gk= kairos, season}.</dt><dl>
<dt>rejoice- because Christ's kingdom is established, and Satan's cast out of the
<dt>heavens- (plural, includes 1st, 2nd &amp; 3rd heaven)
<dt>woe- The first &quot;Woe&quot; (cp. <a href="rev8.htm#13">8:13</a>; <a href="rev9.htm#1">9:1</a>) involved the oppression of unsaved men<dd>by demons, released by their king, upon the earth.<br>This third &quot;Woe&quot; (cp. <a href="rev11.htm#14">11:14</a>) involves the oppressive reign of Satan himself as king over the citizens of earth.
<dt>Those who tabernacle (dwell temporarily) in the heavens are 
<dd>the saints who expect to dwell permanently in the City from which Christ will rule.
<dt>As Satan's territory has been limited, so has his time been limited. 
<dd>He knows what the earth dwellers have yet to discover.</dl><dt>
<b><i>12:13 And when the dragon saw that he was cast unto the earth, <br>
he persecuted the woman which brought forth the man [child].</i></b>
<dd>Unable to destroy God's Anointed One, Satan turns his wrath upon Israel (the people through whom Christ came into the world).<dt>
<b><i>12:14 And to the woman were given two wings of a great eagle,<br>
that she might fly into the wilderness,<br>
into her place, where she is nourished </i></b>{translated 'fed', in <a href="rev12.htm#6" target="lwr_lt">v.6</a>}<b><i><br>
for a time, and times, and half a time, from the face of the serpent.</i></b></dt><dl>
<dt>two wings-<ul> 
<li>Some suggest this speaks of evacuation by aircraft,<dd>perhaps provided by the United States (the eagle). However, this is speculation. Furthermore, if the place prepared (<a href="rev12.htm#6" target="lwr_lt">v.6</a>) in the wilderness is the city          of Petra, there is no place for aircraft to land.</dd>
<li>Some see 'the wilderness' as descriptive of a dispersion of Israel into the gentile nations.
<li>In the words of scripture, this speaks of the protection &amp; provision of the Lord Himself.<dd>Israel cannot deliver herself. God does for her what she cannot, and what no one else will do. eg., <a href="ex19.htm#4">Ex 19:4</a>; <a href="deu32.htm#11">Deut 32:11,12</a></dd></ul>
<dt>fly- This is the 'flight' from Judea which Jesus foretold. <a href="mat24.htm#16">Mat 24:16-22</a>
<dt>time, times and half a time= 3.5 years (cp. <a href="dan12.htm#7">Dan 12:7,11</a>)</dl><dt>
<b><i>12:15 And the serpent cast out of his mouth water as a flood</i></b> {lit., river} <b><i>after the woman,<br>
that he might cause her to be carried away of the flood</i></b> {lit., to become riverborne}.</dt><dl>
<dt>flood -- may be a literal flood of water<dd>(eg. by opening a reservoir into the valley by which Israel flees).
<br>Or, it may signify an overwhelming military force. cp. <a href="isa43.htm#2">Isa 43:2</a>; <a href="isa59.htm#19">59:19</a></dl><dt>
<b><i>12:16 And the earth helped the woman, and the earth opened her mouth,<br>
and swallowed up the flood which the dragon cast out of his mouth.</i></b></dt><dl>
<dt>earth opened her mouth -<ul>
<li>perhaps by a great earthquake (as foretold, at Christ's return, <a href="zech14.htm#1">Zech 14:1-5</a>)
<li>perhaps the 'flood' will be turned to provide for Israel (as He will turn the valley of Achor {trouble} into a door of hope. <a href="isa41.htm#17">Isa 41:17,18</a>; <a href="hos2.htm#15">Hos 2:15,16</a>)</ul></dl><dt>
<b><i>12:17 And the dragon was wroth with the woman,<br>
and went to make war with the remnant of her seed,<br>
which keep the commandments of God, and have the testimony of Jesus Christ.</i></b></dt><dl>
<dt>the remnant- GK= loipoi, the rest, those remaining. 
<dd>Satan has been unsuccessful in destroying the Jews who fled from Judea, so he turns against those living elsewhere (the rest of them). By their description, we see that this remnant of Israel are believers.
<dt>the remnant of her seed- They are physical descendants of Israel, who...<ul>
<li>keep the commandments of God- ie., they follow and adhere to the Word of God.
<dd>This word for 'commandments' is sometimes used of the OT Law.<br>However, it is also applied to the NT scriptures (eg., <a href="mat28.htm#20">Mat 28:20</a>; <a href="rev14.htm#12">Rev 14:12</a>; <a href="rev22.htm#13">22:13,14</a>).
<li>have the testimony {GK=marturia} of Jesus- They bear witness to Jesus as their Messiah,
<dd>because they &quot;have {ie., hold, possess} the testimony of Jesus.&quot; 
<br>This testimony includes all that God's Word declares about the Person and Work of the Savior (<a href="joh5.htm#39">Joh 5:39</a>; <a href="rev19.htm#10">Rev 19:10</a>),
<br>and all that Christ Himself has spoken (eg., <a href="joh14.htm#6">John 14:6</a>; <a href="rev1.htm#1">Rev 1:1-3, 8-9</a>).</ul>
<dt>make war- the idiom &quot;to make war&quot; suggests an extended campaign rather than an isolated battle.<dd>Since he cannot displace the Lord, Satan is determined to destroy &quot;the apple of His eye&quot; (<a href="deu32.htm#9">Deu 32:9,10</a>; <a href="zech2.htm#8">Zech 2:8-10</a>).</dl>
