Proverbs   7<br>1. My son, keep my words, and lay up my commandments with thee.<br><a name="2">2</a>  Keep my commandments, and live; and my law as the apple of thine eye.<br><a name="3">3</a>  Bind them upon thy fingers, write them upon the table of thine heart.<br><a name="4">4</a>  Say unto wisdom, Thou [art] my sister; and call understanding [thy] kinswoman:<br><a name="5">5</a>  That they may keep thee from the strange woman, from the stranger [which] flattereth with her words.<br><a name="6">6</a>. For at the window of my house I looked through my casement,<br><a name="7">7</a>  And beheld among the simple ones, I discerned among the youths, a young man void of understanding,<br><a name="8">8</a>  Passing through the street near her corner; and he went the way to her house,<br><a name="9">9</a>  In the twilight, in the evening, in the black and dark night:<br><a name="10">10</a>  And, behold, there met him a woman [with] the attire of an harlot, and subtil of heart.<br><a name="11">11</a>  (She [is] loud and stubborn; her feet abide not in her house:<br><a name="12">12</a>  Now [is she] without, now in the streets, and lieth in wait at every corner.)<br><a name="13">13</a>  So she caught him, and kissed him, [and] with an impudent face said unto him,<br><a name="14">14</a>  [I have] peace offerings with me; this day have I payed my vows.<br><a name="15">15</a>  Therefore came I forth to meet thee, diligently to seek thy face, and I have found thee.<br><a name="16">16</a>  I have decked my bed with coverings of tapestry, with carved [works], with fine linen of Egypt.<br><a name="17">17</a>  I have perfumed my bed with myrrh, aloes, and cinnamon.<br><a name="18">18</a>  Come, let us take our fill of love until the morning: let us solace ourselves with loves.<br><a name="19">19</a>  For the goodman [is] not at home, he is gone a long journey:<br><a name="20">20</a>  He hath taken a bag of money with him, [and] will come home at the day appointed.<br><a name="21">21</a>  With her much fair speech she caused him to yield, with the flattering of her lips she forced him.<br><a name="22">22</a>  He goeth after her straightway, as an ox goeth to the slaughter, or as a fool to the correction of the stocks;<br><a name="23">23</a>  Till a dart strike through his liver; as a bird hasteth to the snare, and knoweth not that it [is] for his life.<br><a name="24">24</a>. Hearken unto me now therefore, O ye children, and attend to the words of my mouth.<br><a name="25">25</a>  Let not thine heart decline to her ways, go not astray in her paths.<br><a name="26">26</a>  For she hath cast down many wounded: yea, many strong [men] have been slain by her.<br><a name="27">27</a>  Her house [is] the way to hell, going down to the chambers of death.<br><br>Go to <a href="pro8.htm#1">Proverbs 8</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
