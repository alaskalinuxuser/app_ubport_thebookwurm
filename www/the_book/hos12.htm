Hosea  12<br>1. Ephraim feedeth on wind, and followeth after the east wind: he daily increaseth lies and desolation; and they do make a covenant with the Assyrians, and oil is carried into Egypt.<br><a name="2">2</a>  The LORD hath also a controversy with Judah, and will punish Jacob according to his ways; according to his doings will he recompense him.<br><a name="3">3</a>  He took his brother by the heel in the womb, and by his strength he had power with God:<br><a name="4">4</a>  Yea, he had power over the angel, and prevailed: he wept, and made supplication unto him: he found him [in] Bethel, and there he spake with us;<br><a name="5">5</a>  Even the LORD God of hosts; the LORD [is] his memorial.<br><a name="6">6</a>  Therefore turn thou to thy God: keep mercy and judgment, and wait on thy God continually.<br><a name="7">7</a>. [He is] a merchant, the balances of deceit [are] in his hand: he loveth to oppress.<br><a name="8">8</a>  And Ephraim said, Yet I am become rich, I have found me out substance: [in] all my labours they shall find none iniquity in me that [were] sin.<br><a name="9">9</a>  And I [that am] the LORD thy God from the land of Egypt will yet make thee to dwell in tabernacles, as in the days of the solemn feast.<br><a name="10">10</a>  I have also spoken by the prophets, and I have multiplied visions, and used similitudes, by the ministry of the prophets.<br><a name="11">11</a>  [Is there] iniquity [in] Gilead? surely they are vanity: they sacrifice bullocks in Gilgal; yea, their altars [are] as heaps in the furrows of the fields.<br><a name="12">12</a>  And Jacob fled into the country of Syria, and Israel served for a wife, and for a wife he kept [sheep].<br><a name="13">13</a>  And by a prophet the LORD brought Israel out of Egypt, and by a prophet was he preserved.<br><a name="14">14</a>  Ephraim provoked [him] to anger most bitterly: therefore shall he leave his blood upon him, and his reproach shall his Lord return unto him.<br><br>Go to <a href="hos13.htm#1">Hosea 13</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
