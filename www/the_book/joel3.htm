Joel   3<br> 1. For, behold, in those days, and in that time, when I shall bring again the captivity of Judah and Jerusalem,<br><a name="2">2</a>  I will also gather all nations, and will bring them down into the valley of Jehoshaphat, and will plead with them there for my people and [for] my heritage Israel, whom they have scattered among the nations, and parted my land.<br><a name="3">3</a>  And they have cast lots for my people; and have given a boy for an harlot, and sold a girl for wine, that they might drink.<br><a name="4">4</a>  Yea, and what have ye to do with me, O Tyre, and Zidon, and all the coasts of Palestine? will ye render me a recompence? and if ye recompense me, swiftly [and] speedily will I return your recompence upon your own head;<br><a name="5">5</a>  Because ye have taken my silver and my gold, and have carried into your temples my goodly pleasant things:<br><a name="6">6</a>  The children also of Judah and the children of Jerusalem have ye sold unto the Grecians, that ye might remove them far from their border.<br><a name="7">7</a>  Behold, I will raise them out of the place whither ye have sold them, and will return your recompence upon your own head:<br><a name="8">8</a>  And I will sell your sons and your daughters into the hand of the children of Judah, and they shall sell them to the Sabeans, to a people far off: for the LORD hath spoken [it].<br><a name="9">9</a>. Proclaim ye this among the Gentiles; Prepare war, wake up the mighty men, let all the men of war draw near; let them come up:<br><a name="10">10</a>  Beat your plowshares into swords, and your pruninghooks into spears: let the weak say, I [am] strong.<br><a name="11">11</a>  Assemble yourselves, and come, all ye heathen, and gather yourselves together round about: thither cause thy mighty ones to come down, O LORD.<br><a name="12">12</a>  Let the heathen be wakened, and come up to the valley of Jehoshaphat: for there will I sit to judge all the heathen round about.<br><a name="13">13</a>  Put ye in the sickle, for the harvest is ripe: come, get you down; for the press is full, the fats overflow; for their wickedness [is] great.<br><a name="14">14</a>  Multitudes, multitudes in the valley of decision: for the day of the LORD [is] near in the valley of decision.<br><a name="15">15</a>  The sun and the moon shall be darkened, and the stars shall withdraw their shining.<br><a name="16">16</a>  The LORD also shall roar out of Zion, and utter his voice from Jerusalem; and the heavens and the earth shall shake: but the LORD [will be] the hope of his people, and the strength of the children of Israel.<br><a name="17">17</a>  So shall ye know that I [am] the LORD your God dwelling in Zion, my holy mountain: then shall Jerusalem be holy, and there shall no strangers pass through her any more.<br><a name="18">18</a>. And it shall come to pass in that day, [that] the mountains shall drop down new wine, and the hills shall flow with milk, and all the rivers of Judah shall flow with waters, and a fountain shall come forth of the house of the LORD, and shall water the valley of Shittim.<br><a name="19">19</a>  Egypt shall be a desolation, and Edom shall be a desolate wilderness, for the violence [against] the children of Judah, because they have shed innocent blood in their land.<br><a name="20">20</a>  But Judah shall dwell for ever, and Jerusalem from generation to generation.<br><a name="21">21</a>  For I will cleanse their blood [that] I have not cleansed: for the LORD dwelleth in Zion.<br><br>End of Joel.<br>Go to <a href="amos1.htm#1">Amos 1</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
