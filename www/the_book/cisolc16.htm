<b>Volume 3, Lesson 16</b><br>
by C.I. Scofield
<h2>The Two Advents</h2></center>
<p>The Bible teaches of two advents (or 'comings') of the Lord. One has already occurred. The other is yet future.</p><b><ol type="A">
<li>First advent</b><br>
In due time the fulfillment of Messianic prophecy began with the birth of the virgin's Son according to Isaiah, in Bethlehem according to Micah, and proceeded with perfect literalness unto the full accomplishment of every prediction of Messiah's humiliation.<ul>
<li><a href="luk2.htm#7">Luke 2:7</a> - &quot;She brought forth her firstborn Son&quot;
<li><a href="heb9.htm#26">Hebrews 9:26</a> - &quot;He appeared to put away sin by the sacrifice of Himself&quot;
<li><a href="joh3.htm#17">John 3:17</a> - &quot;God sent not His Son... to condemn... but that the world through Him might be saved&quot;
<li><a href="zech9.htm#9">Zechariah 9:9</a> - &quot;He is just... lowly, and riding upon an ass&quot;
<li><a href="joh19.htm#15">John 19:15,16</a> - &quot;Crucify Him&quot;</ul><b>
<li>Second advent</b><br>
We must not conclude that the wickedness of man has baffled the deliberate purpose of God, for His counsels include a second advent of His Son. Then the prediction concerning Messiah's earthly glory will receive the same precise and literal fulfillment as did those Scriptures which concerned His earthly sufferings.<ul>
<li><a href="act15.htm#14">Acts 15:14-17</a> - &quot;I will return&quot;
<li><a href="mat24.htm#30">Matthew 24:30</a> - &quot;Coming in the clouds of heaven with power and great glory&quot;
<li><a href="heb9.htm#28">Hebrews 9:28</a> - &quot;Unto them that look for Him shall He appear the second time&quot;
<li><a href="2the1.htm#7">2Thessalonians 1:7,8</a> - &quot;The Lord Jesus shall be revealed from heaven&quot;</ul><b>
<li>Contrasting pictures of the Messiah</b><br>
Whoever carefully considers Old Testament prophecies must be struck by two contrasting, and seemingly contradictory, lines of prophecy concerning the coming Messiah.<ol type="1">
<li>The coming of the suffering Messiah (first advent)<br>
One body of prediction speaks of Him as coming in weakness and humiliation, a man of sorrows and acquainted with grief, a root out of dry ground, having no form, nor comeliness, nor beauty that He should be desired. His visage is to be marred, His hand and feet pierced, He is to be forsaken of man and of God, and to make His grave with the wicked.<ul>
<li><a href="isa53.htm#2">Isaiah 53:2-12</a> - &quot;A root... no beauty... despised and rejected&quot;
<li><a href="psa22.htm#1">Psalm 22:1-18</a> - &quot;Forsaken... despised&quot;
<li><a href="dan9.htm#26">Daniel 9:26</a> - &quot;Messiah be cut off [die]&quot;
<li><a href="zech13.htm#6">Zechariah 13:6,7</a> - &quot;Wounded&quot;
<li><a href="mar15.htm#15">Mark 15:15</a> - &quot;Crucified&quot;</ul>
<li>The coming of the triumphant Messiah (second advent)<br>
The other line of prophecy foretells a splendid and resistless Sovereign, purging the earth with awful judgments, regathering dispersed Israel, restoring the throne of David in more than Solomon's splendor, and introducing a reign of profound peace and perfect righteousness.<ul>
<li><a href="isa11.htm#1">Isaiah 11:1,2,10-12</a> - &quot;A Branch... shall be glorious&quot;
<li><a href="isa9.htm#6">Isaiah 9:6,7</a> - &quot;Wonderful, Counsellor, The mighty God, The everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace&quot;
<li><a href="dan7.htm#13">Daniel 7:13,14</a> - &quot;Dominion and glory&quot;
<li><a href="mic5.htm#2">Micah 5:2</a> - &quot;Ruler in Israel&quot;
<li><a href="mat1.htm#1">Matthew 1:1</a> - &quot;Son of David&quot;
<li><a href="mat2.htm#2">Matthew 2:2</a> - &quot;King of the Jews&quot;
<li><a href="luk1.htm#31">Luke 1:31-33</a> - &quot;Jesus... He shall reign... for ever&quot;</ul></ol></ol>
