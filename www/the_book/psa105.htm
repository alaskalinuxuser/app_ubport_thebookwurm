Psalms 105<br>1. O give thanks unto the LORD; call upon his name: make known his deeds among the people.<br><a name="2">2</a>  Sing unto him, sing psalms unto him: talk ye of all his wondrous works.<br><a name="3">3</a>  Glory ye in his holy name: let the heart of them rejoice that seek the LORD.<br><a name="4">4</a>  Seek the LORD, and his strength: seek his face evermore.<br><a name="5">5</a>  Remember his marvellous works that he hath done; his wonders, and the judgments of his mouth;<br><a name="6">6</a>  O ye seed of Abraham his servant, ye children of Jacob his chosen.<br><a name="7">7</a>  He [is] the LORD our God: his judgments [are] in all the earth.<br><a name="8">8</a>. He hath remembered his covenant for ever, the word [which] he commanded to a thousand generations.<br><a name="9">9</a>  Which [covenant] he made with Abraham, and his oath unto Isaac;<br><a name="10">10</a>  And confirmed the same unto Jacob for a law, [and] to Israel [for] an everlasting covenant:<br><a name="11">11</a>  Saying, Unto thee will I give the land of Canaan, the lot of your inheritance:<br><a name="12">12</a>  When they were [but] a few men in number; yea, very few, and strangers in it.<br><a name="13">13</a>  When they went from one nation to another, from [one] kingdom to another people;<br><a name="14">14</a>  He suffered no man to do them wrong: yea, he reproved kings for their sakes;<br><a name="15">15</a>  [Saying], Touch not mine anointed, and do my prophets no harm.<br><a name="16">16</a>  Moreover he called for a famine upon the land: he brake the whole staff of bread.<br><a name="17">17</a>  He sent a man before them, [even] Joseph, [who] was sold for a servant:<br><a name="18">18</a>  Whose feet they hurt with fetters: he was laid in iron:<br><a name="19">19</a>  Until the time that his word came: the word of the LORD tried him.<br><a name="20">20</a>  The king sent and loosed him; [even] the ruler of the people, and let him go free.<br><a name="21">21</a>  He made him lord of his house, and ruler of all his substance:<br><a name="22">22</a>  To bind his princes at his pleasure; and teach his senators wisdom.<br><a name="23">23</a>  Israel also came into Egypt; and Jacob sojourned in the land of Ham.<br><a name="24">24</a>  And he increased his people greatly; and made them stronger than their enemies.<br><a name="25">25</a>. He turned their heart to hate his people, to deal subtilly with his servants.<br><a name="26">26</a>  He sent Moses his servant; [and] Aaron whom he had chosen.<br><a name="27">27</a>  They shewed his signs among them, and wonders in the land of Ham.<br><a name="28">28</a>  He sent darkness, and made it dark; and they rebelled not against his word.<br><a name="29">29</a>  He turned their waters into blood, and slew their fish.<br><a name="30">30</a>  Their land brought forth frogs in abundance, in the chambers of their kings.<br><a name="31">31</a>  He spake, and there came divers sorts of flies, [and] lice in all their coasts.<br><a name="32">32</a>  He gave them hail for rain, [and] flaming fire in their land.<br><a name="33">33</a>  He smote their vines also and their fig trees; and brake the trees of their coasts.<br><a name="34">34</a>  He spake, and the locusts came, and caterpillers, and that without number,<br><a name="35">35</a>  And did eat up all the herbs in their land, and devoured the fruit of their ground.<br><a name="36">36</a>  He smote also all the firstborn in their land, the chief of all their strength.<br><a name="37">37</a>  He brought them forth also with silver and gold: and [there was] not one feeble [person] among their tribes.<br><a name="38">38</a>  Egypt was glad when they departed: for the fear of them fell upon them.<br><a name="39">39</a>  He spread a cloud for a covering; and fire to give light in the night.<br><a name="40">40</a>  [The people] asked, and he brought quails, and satisfied them with the bread of heaven.<br><a name="41">41</a>  He opened the rock, and the waters gushed out; they ran in the dry places [like] a river.<br><a name="42">42</a>  For he remembered his holy promise, [and] Abraham his servant.<br><a name="43">43</a>  And he brought forth his people with joy, [and] his chosen with gladness:<br><a name="44">44</a>  And gave them the lands of the heathen: and they inherited the labour of the people;<br><a name="45">45</a>  That they might observe his statutes, and keep his laws.
