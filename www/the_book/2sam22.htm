2Samuel  22<br> 1. And David spake unto the LORD the words of this song in the day [that] the LORD had delivered him out of the hand of all his enemies, and out of the hand of Saul:<br><a name="2">2</a>. And he said, The LORD [is] my rock, and my fortress, and my deliverer;<br><a name="3">3</a>  The God of my rock; in him will I trust: [he is] my shield, and the horn of my salvation, my high tower, and my refuge, my saviour; thou savest me from violence.<br><a name="4">4</a>  I will call on the LORD, [who is] worthy to be praised: so shall I be saved from mine enemies.<br><a name="5">5</a>  When the waves of death compassed me, the floods of ungodly men made me afraid;<br><a name="6">6</a>  The sorrows of hell compassed me about; the snares of death prevented me;<br><a name="7">7</a>  In my distress I called upon the LORD, and cried to my God: and he did hear my voice out of his temple, and my cry [did enter] into his ears.<br><a name="8">8</a>  Then the earth shook and trembled; the foundations of heaven moved and shook, because he was wroth.<br><a name="9">9</a>  There went up a smoke out of his nostrils, and fire out of his mouth devoured: coals were kindled by it.<br><a name="10">10</a>  He bowed the heavens also, and came down; and darkness [was] under his feet.<br><a name="11">11</a>  And he rode upon a cherub, and did fly: and he was seen upon the wings of the wind.<br><a name="12">12</a>  And he made darkness pavilions round about him, dark waters, [and] thick clouds of the skies.<br><a name="13">13</a>  Through the brightness before him were coals of fire kindled.<br><a name="14">14</a>  The LORD thundered from heaven, and the most High uttered his voice.<br><a name="15">15</a>  And he sent out arrows, and scattered them; lightning, and discomfited them.<br><a name="16">16</a>  And the channels of the sea appeared, the foundations of the world were discovered, at the rebuking of the LORD, at the blast of the breath of his nostrils.<br><a name="17">17</a>  He sent from above, he took me; he drew me out of many waters;<br><a name="18">18</a>  He delivered me from my strong enemy, [and] from them that hated me: for they were too strong for me.<br><a name="19">19</a>  They prevented me in the day of my calamity: but the LORD was my stay.<br><a name="20">20</a>  He brought me forth also into a large place: he delivered me, because he delighted in me.<br><a name="21">21</a>  The LORD rewarded me according to my righteousness: according to the cleanness of my hands hath he recompensed me.<br><a name="22">22</a>  For I have kept the ways of the LORD, and have not wickedly departed from my God.<br><a name="23">23</a>  For all his judgments [were] before me: and [as for] his statutes, I did not depart from them.<br><a name="24">24</a>  I was also upright before him, and have kept myself from mine iniquity.<br><a name="25">25</a>  Therefore the LORD hath recompensed me according to my righteousness; according to my cleanness in his eye sight.<br><a name="26">26</a>  With the merciful thou wilt shew thyself merciful, [and] with the upright man thou wilt shew thyself upright.<br><a name="27">27</a>  With the pure thou wilt shew thyself pure; and with the froward thou wilt shew thyself unsavoury.<br><a name="28">28</a>  And the afflicted people thou wilt save: but thine eyes [are] upon the haughty, [that] thou mayest bring [them] down.<br><a name="29">29</a>  For thou [art] my lamp, O LORD: and the LORD will lighten my darkness.<br><a name="30">30</a>  For by thee I have run through a troop: by my God have I leaped over a wall.<br><a name="31">31</a>  [As for] God, his way [is] perfect; the word of the LORD [is] tried: he [is] a buckler to all them that trust in him.<br><a name="32">32</a>  For who [is] God, save the LORD? and who [is] a rock, save our God?<br><a name="33">33</a>  God [is] my strength [and] power: and he maketh my way perfect.<br><a name="34">34</a>  He maketh my feet like hinds' [feet]: and setteth me upon my high places.<br><a name="35">35</a>  He teacheth my hands to war; so that a bow of steel is broken by mine arms.<br><a name="36">36</a>  Thou hast also given me the shield of thy salvation: and thy gentleness hath made me great.<br><a name="37">37</a>  Thou hast enlarged my steps under me; so that my feet did not slip.<br><a name="38">38</a>  I have pursued mine enemies, and destroyed them; and turned not again until I had consumed them.<br><a name="39">39</a>  And I have consumed them, and wounded them, that they could not arise: yea, they are fallen under my feet.<br><a name="40">40</a>  For thou hast girded me with strength to battle: them that rose up against me hast thou subdued under me.<br><a name="41">41</a>  Thou hast also given me the necks of mine enemies, that I might destroy them that hate me.<br><a name="42">42</a>  They looked, but [there was] none to save; [even] unto the LORD, but he answered them not.<br><a name="43">43</a>  Then did I beat them as small as the dust of the earth, I did stamp them as the mire of the street, [and] did spread them abroad.<br><a name="44">44</a>  Thou also hast delivered me from the strivings of my people, thou hast kept me [to be] head of the heathen: a people [which] I knew not shall serve me.<br><a name="45">45</a>  Strangers shall submit themselves unto me: as soon as they hear, they shall be obedient unto me.<br><a name="46">46</a>  Strangers shall fade away, and they shall be afraid out of their close places.<br><a name="47">47</a>  The LORD liveth; and blessed [be] my rock; and exalted be the God of the rock of my salvation.<br><a name="48">48</a>  It [is] God that avengeth me, and that bringeth down the people under me,<br><a name="49">49</a>  And that bringeth me forth from mine enemies: thou also hast lifted me up on high above them that rose up against me: thou hast delivered me from the violent man.<br><a name="50">50</a>  Therefore I will give thanks unto thee, O LORD, among the heathen, and I will sing praises unto thy name.<br><a name="51">51</a>  [He is] the tower of salvation for his king: and sheweth mercy to his anointed, unto David, and to his seed for evermore.<br><br>Go to <a href="2sam23.htm#1">II Samuel 23</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
