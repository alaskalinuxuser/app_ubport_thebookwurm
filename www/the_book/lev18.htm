Leviticus  18<br> 1. And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,<br><a name="2">2</a>  Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, I am the LORD your God.<br><a name="3">3</a>  After the doings of the land of Egypt, wherein ye dwelt, shall ye not do: and after the doings of the land of Canaan, whither I bring you, shall ye not do: neither shall ye walk in their ordinances.<br><a name="4">4</a>  Ye shall do my judgments, and keep mine ordinances, to walk therein: I [am] the LORD your God.<br><a name="5">5</a>  Ye shall therefore keep my statutes, and my judgments: which if a man do, he shall live in them: I [am] the LORD.<br><a name="6">6</a>. None of you shall approach to any that is near of kin to him, to uncover [their] nakedness: I [am] the LORD.<br><a name="7">7</a>  The nakedness of thy father, or the nakedness of thy mother, shalt thou not uncover: she [is] thy mother; thou shalt not uncover her nakedness.<br><a name="8">8</a>  The nakedness of thy father's wife shalt thou not uncover: it [is] thy father's nakedness.<br><a name="9">9</a>  The nakedness of thy sister, the daughter of thy father, or daughter of thy mother, [whether she be] born at home, or born abroad, [even] their nakedness thou shalt not uncover.<br><a name="10">10</a>  The nakedness of thy son's daughter, or of thy daughter's daughter, [even] their nakedness thou shalt not uncover: for theirs [is] thine own nakedness.<br><a name="11">11</a>  The nakedness of thy father's wife's daughter, begotten of thy father, she [is] thy sister, thou shalt not uncover her nakedness.<br><a name="12">12</a>  Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy father's sister: she [is] thy father's near kinswoman.<br><a name="13">13</a>  Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy mother's sister: for she [is] thy mother's near kinswoman.<br><a name="14">14</a>  Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy father's brother, thou shalt not approach to his wife: she [is] thine aunt.<br><a name="15">15</a>  Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy daughter in law: she [is] thy son's wife; thou shalt not uncover her nakedness.<br><a name="16">16</a>  Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy brother's wife: it [is] thy brother's nakedness.<br><a name="17">17</a>  Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of a woman and her daughter, neither shalt thou take her son's daughter, or her daughter's daughter, to uncover her nakedness; [for] they [are] her near kinswomen: it [is] wickedness.<br><a name="18">18</a>  Neither shalt thou take a wife to her sister, to vex [her], to uncover her nakedness, beside the other in her life [time].<br><a name="19">19</a>. Also thou shalt not approach unto a woman to uncover her nakedness, as long as she is put apart for her uncleanness.<br><a name="20">20</a>  Moreover thou shalt not lie carnally with thy neighbour's wife, to defile thyself with her.<br><a name="21">21</a>  And thou shalt not let any of thy seed pass through [the fire] to Molech, neither shalt thou profane the name of thy God: I [am] the LORD.<br><a name="22">22</a>  Thou shalt not lie with mankind, as with womankind: it [is] abomination.<br><a name="23">23</a>  Neither shalt thou lie with any beast to defile thyself therewith: neither shall any woman stand before a beast to lie down thereto: it [is] confusion.<br><a name="24">24</a>  Defile not ye yourselves in any of these things: for in all these the nations are defiled which I cast out before you:<br><a name="25">25</a>  And the land is defiled: therefore I do visit the iniquity thereof upon it, and the land itself vomiteth out her inhabitants.<br><a name="26">26</a>  Ye shall therefore keep my statutes and my judgments, and shall not commit [any] of these abominations; [neither] any of your own nation, nor any stranger that sojourneth among you:<br><a name="27">27</a>  (For all these abominations have the men of the land done, which [were] before you, and the land is defiled;)<br><a name="28">28</a>  That the land spue not you out also, when ye defile it, as it spued out the nations that [were] before you.<br><a name="29">29</a>  For whosoever shall commit any of these abominations, even the souls that commit [them] shall be cut off from among their people.<br><a name="30">30</a>  Therefore shall ye keep mine ordinance, that [ye] commit not [any one] of these abominable customs, which were committed before you, and that ye defile not yourselves therein: I [am] the LORD your God.<br><br>Go to <a href="lev19.htm#1">Leviticus 19</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
