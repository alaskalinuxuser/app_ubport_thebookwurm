Hosea   4<br>1. Hear the word of the LORD, ye children of Israel: for the LORD hath a controversy with the inhabitants of the land, because [there is] no truth, nor mercy, nor knowledge of God in the land.<br><a name="2">2</a>  By swearing, and lying, and killing, and stealing, and committing adultery, they break out, and blood toucheth blood.<br><a name="3">3</a>  Therefore shall the land mourn, and every one that dwelleth therein shall languish, with the beasts of the field, and with the fowls of heaven; yea, the fishes of the sea also shall be taken away.<br><a name="4">4</a>  Yet let no man strive, nor reprove another: for thy people [are] as they that strive with the priest.<br><a name="5">5</a>  Therefore shalt thou fall in the day, and the prophet also shall fall with thee in the night, and I will destroy thy mother.<br><a name="6">6</a>. My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge: because thou hast rejected knowledge, I will also reject thee, that thou shalt be no priest to me: seeing thou hast forgotten the law of thy God, I will also forget thy children.<br><a name="7">7</a>  As they were increased, so they sinned against me: [therefore] will I change their glory into shame.<br><a name="8">8</a>  They eat up the sin of my people, and they set their heart on their iniquity.<br><a name="9">9</a>  And there shall be, like people, like priest: and I will punish them for their ways, and reward them their doings.<br><a name="10">10</a>  For they shall eat, and not have enough: they shall commit whoredom, and shall not increase: because they have left off to take heed to the LORD.<br><a name="11">11</a>  Whoredom and wine and new wine take away the heart.<br><a name="12">12</a>. My people ask counsel at their stocks, and their staff declareth unto them: for the spirit of whoredoms hath caused [them] to err, and they have gone a whoring from under their God.<br><a name="13">13</a>  They sacrifice upon the tops of the mountains, and burn incense upon the hills, under oaks and poplars and elms, because the shadow thereof [is] good: therefore your daughters shall commit whoredom, and your spouses shall commit adultery.<br><a name="14">14</a>  I will not punish your daughters when they commit whoredom, nor your spouses when they commit adultery: for themselves are separated with whores, and they sacrifice with harlots: therefore the people [that] doth not understand shall fall.<br><a name="15">15</a>  Though thou, Israel, play the harlot, [yet] let not Judah offend; and come not ye unto Gilgal, neither go ye up to Bethaven, nor swear, The LORD liveth.<br><a name="16">16</a>  For Israel slideth back as a backsliding heifer: now the LORD will feed them as a lamb in a large place.<br><a name="17">17</a>  Ephraim [is] joined to idols: let him alone.<br><a name="18">18</a>  Their drink is sour: they have committed whoredom continually: her rulers [with] shame do love, Give ye.<br><a name="19">19</a>  The wind hath bound her up in her wings, and they shall be ashamed because of their sacrifices.<br><br>Go to <a href="hos5.htm#1">Hosea 5</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
