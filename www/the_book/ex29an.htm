<dt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Consecration of the Priests (ch. 29) -
<dt><b><i>29:1 And this [is] the thing that thou shalt do unto them </b></i>{ie., Aaron &amp; his sons}<i><b><br>to hallow them, to minister unto me in the priest's office:<br>Take one young bullock, and two rams without blemish,<br>
29:2 And unleavened bread, and cakes unleavened tempered with oil,<br>and wafers unleavened anointed with oil: [of] wheaten flour shalt thou make them.<br>
29:3 And thou shalt put them into one basket,<br>and bring them in the basket, with the bullock and the two rams.<br>
29:4 And Aaron and his sons thou shalt bring unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation,<br>and shalt wash them with water.<br>
29:5 And thou shalt take the garments, and put upon Aaron the coat,<br>and the robe of the ephod, and the ephod, and the breastplate,<br>and gird him with the curious girdle of the ephod:<br>
29:6 And thou shalt put the mitre upon his head, and put the holy crown upon the mitre.<br>
29:7 Then shalt thou take the anointing oil, and pour [it] upon his head, and anoint him.</i></b></dt><dl>
<dt>Instructions for the Consecration of the priests -
<dd>These ceremonies were accomplished following the consecration of the Tabernacle, by Moses, as recorded in <a href="ex40.htm#12">Ex 40:12-16</a> and <a href="lev8.htm#1">Lev 8</a>.<br>Here also, the high priest is a type of Christ, and the other priests picture the relation of the believer-priest to Him.
<dt>The Order of Consecration -<ol type="1">
<li>wash <i>them</i> (<a href="ex29.htm#4" target="lwr_lt">v.4</a>) -<dd>All priests (except Christ) require the &quot;washing of regeneration.&quot; <a href="tit3.htm#5">Titus 3:5</a>; <a href="joh3.htm#5">Joh 3:5,6</a>.</dd><dd>However, Christ also was baptized prior to His ministry &quot;to fulfill all righteousness&quot; in identifying Himself with those who seek to serve the LORD. <a href="mat3.htm#11">Mat 3:11-15</a></dd>
<li>dress Aaron (<a href="ex29.htm#5" target="lwr_lt">v.5-6</a>) -<dd>The Garments of the High Priest depict Christ's &quot;glory and beauty,&quot; and His deity and humanity.</dd><dd>Aaron could not approach the Holy Place without these Garments, because his acceptance there was only &quot;in the Beloved.&quot;</dd><dd>Prior to His ministry in our behalf, Christ robed Himself in our humanity (<a href="heb2.htm#14">Heb 2:14-18</a>).</dd>
<li>anoint Aaron (<a href="ex29.htm#7" target="lwr_lt">v.7</a>) -<dd>Aaron (as a type of Christ), was anointed with oil (a type of the Holy Spirit) before blood was shed (in the sacrifices of v.10-42).</dd><dd>Aaron's sons (type of the believer-priest) were not anointed with oil until after blood was shed (<a href="ex29.htm#20" target="lwr_lt">v.20,21</a>).</dd><dd>Note also that upon Aaron, the anointing oil was <i>poured</i>. But after the sacrifices, the priests were only &quot;sprinkled&quot; with blood and oil.</dd><dd>This order foreshadows the preparation of Christ for His priestly ministry...<ol type="a"><li>Christ was anointed with the Holy Spirit long before His blood was shed on the cross (cp. <a href="mat3.htm#16">Mat 3:16,17</a>; <a href="luk4.htm#18">Luk 4:18,19</a>).<li>His shed blood made possible our anointing (<a href="joh7.htm#39">Joh 7:39</a>; <a href="act2.htm#32">Acts 2:32,33</a>; <a href="rev5.htm#9">Rev 5:9,10</a>).<li>Christ was anointed &quot;above His fellows&quot; (<a href="psa45.htm#7">Psa 45:7</a>; <a href="heb1.htm#9">Heb 1:9</a>; <a href="joh3.htm#34">Joh 3:34</a>) that He might have the pre-eminence (<a href="col1.htm#18">Col 1:18</a>).</dd></ol>
<li>dress Aaron's sons (<a href="ex29.htm#8" target="lwr_lt">v.8,9</a>) -<dd>Without the prior preparation of our High Priest, we would not be suited for God's service.</dd>
<li>the Sacrifices of Consecration - (to be discussed briefly, as we come to them in the text, below)<ol type="a">
<li>the Sin-offering (<a href="ex29.htm#10" target="lwr_lt">v.10-14</a>)
<li>the Whole Burnt-offering (<a href="ex29.htm#15" target="lwr_lt">v.15-18</a>)
<li>the Ram of Consecration (<a href="ex29.htm#19" target="lwr_lt">v.19-34</a>)
<li>the Continual Burnt-offerings (twice a day for the seven day consecration period, <a href="ex29.htm#35" target="lwr_lt">v.35-42</a>)</ol></ol></dl>
<dt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Sin-offering (<a href="ex29.htm#10" target="lwr_lt">v.10-14</a>) -
<dt><b><i>29:8 And thou shalt bring his sons, and put coats upon them.<br>
29:9 And thou shalt gird them with girdles, Aaron and his sons, and put the bonnets on them:<br>and the priest's office shall be theirs for a perpetual statute:<br>and thou shalt consecrate Aaron and his sons.<br>
29:10 And thou shalt cause a bullock to be brought before the tabernacle of the congregation:<br>and Aaron and his sons shall put their hands upon the head of the bullock.<br>
29:11 And thou shalt kill the bullock before the LORD,<br>[by] the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.<br>
29:12 And thou shalt take of the blood of the bullock,<br>and put [it] upon the horns of the altar with thy finger,<br>and pour all the blood beside the bottom of the altar.<br>
29:13 And thou shalt take all the fat that covereth the inwards, and the caul [that is] above the liver,<br>and the two kidneys, and the fat that [is] upon them, and burn [them] upon the altar.<br>
29:14 But the flesh of the bullock, and his skin, and his dung,<br>shalt thou burn with fire without the camp: it [is] a sin offering.</i></b></dt><dl>
<dt>The Sin-offering was the first of the three sacrifices for consecrating the priests.
<dd>It corresponds, in form and function, to the Sin-offering as described in <a href="lev4.htm#1">Lev 4:1-12</a>.
<dt>they shall put their hands upon the head of the bullock.- 
<dd>This was an act of identification. In doing this, Aaron and his sons were saying:<br>- - 'This is my substitute. This is the death I deserve. This is for my sin.'<br>
The sin-offering pictures the substitutionary death of Christ.<br> 
- - He took our sins upon Himself. He died the death that we deserve.<br>
- - Having had their sin removed, those who are identified with Him are therefore judicially righteous before God. <a href="rom5.htm#8">Rom 5:8,19</a>; <a href="2cor5.htm#21">2Cor 5:21</a>
<dt>blood - Indicated that the wages of sin had been paid (by the substitute). <a href="rom6.htm#23">Rom 6:23</a>
<dd>It was the blood of the Sin-offering, and of the Burnt-offering which were presented at the Mercy-seat on the annual Day of Atonement (<a href="lev16.htm#3">Lev 16:3,14,15</a>).
<dt>the fat... burned on the altar - The fire consumed it all. God's wrath against sin was satisfied. 
<dd>Note that the consumed organs were those dedicated to the removal of impurities from the body.
<dt>The remainder of the sacrifice was to be burned &quot;outside the camp.&quot;
<dd>It was not that the sin-offering was unfit for a holy camp. But rather, that the unholy camp was unfit for the holy sin-offering. cp. <a href="heb13.htm#11">Heb 13:11-13</a><br>- - The Lord Jesus Christ was politically incorrect, and rejected by religious people.<br>Yet, He is the Holy One, who died to make us holy. We need to be identified with Him.</dl>
<dt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Burnt-offering (<a href="ex29.htm#15" target="lwr_lt">v.15-18</a>) -
<dt><b><i>29:15 Thou shalt also take one ram;<br>and Aaron and his sons shall put their hands upon the head of the ram.<br>
29:16 And thou shalt slay the ram,<br>and thou shalt take his blood, and sprinkle [it] round about upon the altar.<br>
29:17 And thou shalt cut the ram in pieces, and wash the inwards of him, and his legs,<br>and put [them] unto his pieces, and unto his head.<br>
29:18 And thou shalt burn the whole ram upon the altar: it [is] a burnt offering unto the LORD:<br>it [is] a sweet savour, an offering made by fire unto the LORD.</i></b></dt><dl>
<dt>The Whole Burnt-offering-<ul>
<li>Aaron and his sons shall place their hands upon the head of the ram.-<dd>Again they were to be identified with the sacrifice, but, now, for a different reason.</dd>
<li>The sacrifice was to be totally consumed.- They were in effect saying:<dd>- - 'As He gave Himself for me, I yield myself to Him, entirely.'</dd><dd>In the burnt-offering, nothing is withheld from God. (cp. <a href="gen22.htm#13">Gen 22:13,15,16</a>; <a href="rom6.htm#1">Rom 6:1-11</a>; <a href="rom12.htm#1">12:1</a>)</dd>
<li>It was a sweet savour to the LORD, in that His servants were declaring that love for Him totally consumed them.
<dd>The Burnt-offering depicts the willing and complete surrender of Christ to the Father's will.</dd><dd>We who are identified with Him ought to likewise give ourselves wholly to Him. cp. <a href="psa69.htm#9">Psa 69:9</a>; <a href="joh2.htm#17">Joh 2:17</a>; <a href="eph5.htm#2">Eph 5:2</a></dd></ul></dl>
<dt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ram of Consecration (<a href="ex29.htm#19" target="lwr_lt">v.19-34</a>) -
<dt><b><i>29:19 And thou shalt take the other ram;<br>and Aaron and his sons shall put their hands upon the head of the ram.<br>
29:20 Then shalt thou kill the ram, and take of his blood,<br>and put [it] upon the tip of the right ear of Aaron, and upon the tip of the right ear of his sons,<br>and upon the thumb of their right hand, and upon the great toe of their right foot,<br>and sprinkle the blood upon the altar round about.<br>
29:21 And thou shalt take of the blood that [is] upon the altar, and of the anointing oil,<br>and sprinkle [it] upon Aaron, and upon his garments,<br>and upon his sons, and upon the garments of his sons with him:<br>and he shall be hallowed, and his garments, and his sons, and his sons' garments with him.<br>
29:22 Also thou shalt take of the ram the fat and the rump, and the fat that covereth the inwards,<br>and the caul [above] the liver, and the two kidneys, and the fat that [is] upon them, and the right shoulder;<br>for it [is] a ram of consecration:<br>
29:23 And one loaf of bread, and one cake of oiled bread,<br>and one wafer out of the basket of the unleavened bread that [is] before the LORD:<br>
29:24 And thou shalt put all in the hands of Aaron, and in the hands of his sons;<br>and shalt wave them [for] a wave offering before the LORD.<br>
29:25 And thou shalt receive them of their hands, and burn [them] upon the altar for a burnt offering,<br>for a sweet savour before the LORD: it [is] an offering made by fire unto the LORD.<br>
29:26 And thou shalt take the breast of the ram of Aaron's consecration,<br>and wave it [for] a wave offering before the LORD: and it shall be thy part.<br>
29:27 And thou shalt sanctify the breast of the wave offering, and the shoulder of the heave offering,<br>which is waved, and which is heaved up, of the ram of the consecration,<br>[even] of [that] which [is] for Aaron, and of [that] which is for his sons:<br>
29:28 And it shall be Aaron's and his sons' by a statute for ever from the children of Israel:<br>for it [is] an heave offering:<br>and it shall be an heave offering from the children of Israel of the sacrifice of their peace offerings,<br>[even] their heave offering unto the LORD.<br>
29:29 And the holy garments of Aaron shall be his sons' after him,<br>to be anointed therein, and to be consecrated in them.<br>
29:30 [And] that son that is priest in his stead shall put them on seven days,<br>when he cometh into the tabernacle of the congregation to minister in the holy [place].<br>
29:31 And thou shalt take the ram of the consecration, and seethe his flesh in the holy place.<br>
29:32 And Aaron and his sons shall eat the flesh of the ram, and the bread that [is] in the basket,<br>[by] the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.<br>
29:33 And they shall eat those things wherewith the atonement was made,<br>to consecrate [and] to sanctify them:<br>but a stranger shall not eat [thereof], because they [are] holy.<br>
29:34 And if ought of the flesh of the consecrations, or of the bread, remain unto the morning,<br>then thou shalt burn the remainder with fire: it shall not be eaten, because it [is] holy.</i></b></dt><dl>
<dt>The Ram of Consecration {ie., &quot;of setting,&quot; or &quot;of installation&quot; of priests into service}-<ul>
<li>put their hands upon the head of the ram - Again, the picture is of identification with Christ.<dd>In this case, for separation to, and empowering for, service.</dd>
<li>blood... on ear... thumb... toe (<a href="ex29.htm#20" target="lwr_lt">v.20</a>) -<dd>The priest's whole person is to be purged of sin, and yielded to Him. <a href="rom12.htm#1">Rom 12:1,2</a></dd>
<li>blood and oil... on the priests' persons and garments (<a href="ex29.htm#21" target="lwr_lt">v.21</a>) -<dd>The priest's life purpose is no longer that of the flesh (which died with Christ), but that of God's direction by the Holy Spirit. <a href="gal2.htm#20">Gal 2:20</a></dd>
<li>a portion of the ram and of the bread... waved... burned on the altar (<a href="ex29.htm#22" target="lwr_lt">v.22-25</a>) -<dd>
Here is a demonstrative statement of identification with Christ in death, to sin and to self.</dd><dd>
&quot;I am crucified with Christ...&quot;
<li>a portion of the ram and of the bread... waved... and eaten -<dd>
Here is a demonstrative statement of identification with Christ in life, to serve God.</dd><dd>&quot;... Nevertheless, I live... yet, not I... but Christ lives in me...&quot;</dd><dd>The believer-priest is nourished by Christ the Bread of Life.</ul></dl>
<dt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Continual Burnt-offering (<a href="ex29.htm#35" target="lwr_lt">v.35-42</a>) -
<dt><b><i>29:35 And thus shalt thou do unto Aaron, and to his sons,<br>according to all [things] which I have commanded thee:<br>seven days shalt thou consecrate them.<br>
29:36 And thou shalt offer every day a bullock [for] a sin offering for atonement:<br>and thou shalt cleanse the altar, when thou hast made an atonement for it,<br>and thou shalt anoint it, to sanctify it.<br>
29:37 Seven days thou shalt make an atonement for the altar, and sanctify it;<br>and it shall be an altar most holy: whatsoever toucheth the altar shall be holy.<br>
29:38 Now this [is that] which thou shalt offer upon the altar;<br>two lambs of the first year day by day continually.<br>
29:39 The one lamb thou shalt offer in the morning;<br>and the other lamb thou shalt offer at even:<br>
29:40 And with the one lamb a tenth deal </b></i>{ie., a tenth part}<i><b> of flour<br>
mingled with the fourth part of an hin of beaten oil;<br>and the fourth part of an hin of wine [for] a drink offering.</b></i><dd>{A 'hin' is a unit of liquid measure equivalent to about 4 quarts or 4 litres.}
<dt><i><b>29:41 And the other lamb thou shalt offer at even,<br>
and shalt do thereto according to the meat </b></i>{lit., 'meal'}<i><b> offering of the morning,<br>and according to the drink offering thereof,<br>for a sweet savour, an offering made by fire unto the LORD.<br>
29:42 [This shall be] a continual burnt offering throughout your generations<br>[at] the door of the tabernacle of the congregation before the LORD:<br>where I will meet you, to speak there unto thee.<br>
29:43 And there I will meet with the children of Israel,<br>and [the tabernacle] shall be sanctified by my glory.<br>
29:44 And I will sanctify the tabernacle of the congregation, and the altar:<br>I will sanctify also both Aaron and his sons, to minister to me in the priest's office.<br>
29:45 And I will dwell among the children of Israel, and will be their God.<br>
29:46 And they shall know that I [am] the LORD their God, that brought them forth out of the land of Egypt,<br>that I may dwell among them: I [am] the LORD their God.</i></b></dt><dl>
<dt>The <i>seven</i> days of the consecration ceremony suggested <i>perfection</i> or <i>completion.</i>
<dt>two lambs... day by day continually... throughout your generations - 
<dd>The Continual Burnt-offering would not stop at the end of this ceremony.<br>
These multiplied sacrifices provided only temporary &quot;atonement&quot; {HB=kaphar, covering} for sin (cp. <a href="ex30.htm#10">Ex 30:10</a>).<dd>They could not take sin away (<a href="heb10.htm#1">Heb 10:1-4</a>).<dd>But they continually pictured the Lamb who would provide the <i>perfect</i> and <i>final</i> &quot;propitiation&quot; {GK=hilasterion, mercy-seat} for sin (<a href="rom3.htm#24">Rom 3:24-26</a>; <a href="heb10.htm#12">Heb 10:12-14</a>).
