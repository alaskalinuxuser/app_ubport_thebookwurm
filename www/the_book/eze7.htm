Ezekiel   7<br>1. Moreover the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,<br><a name="2">2</a>  Also, thou son of man, thus saith the Lord GOD unto the land of Israel; An end, the end is come upon the four corners of the land.<br><a name="3">3</a>  Now [is] the end [come] upon thee, and I will send mine anger upon thee, and will judge thee according to thy ways, and will recompense upon thee all thine abominations.<br><a name="4">4</a>  And mine eye shall not spare thee, neither will I have pity: but I will recompense thy ways upon thee, and thine abominations shall be in the midst of thee: and ye shall know that I [am] the LORD.<br><a name="5">5</a>  Thus saith the Lord GOD; An evil, an only evil, behold, is come.<br><a name="6">6</a>  An end is come, the end is come: it watcheth for thee; behold, it is come.<br><a name="7">7</a>  The morning is come unto thee, O thou that dwellest in the land: the time is come, the day of trouble [is] near, and not the sounding again of the mountains.<br><a name="8">8</a>  Now will I shortly pour out my fury upon thee, and accomplish mine anger upon thee: and I will judge thee according to thy ways, and will recompense thee for all thine abominations.<br><a name="9">9</a>  And mine eye shall not spare, neither will I have pity: I will recompense thee according to thy ways and thine abominations [that] are in the midst of thee; and ye shall know that I [am] the LORD that smiteth.<br><a name="10">10</a>  Behold the day, behold, it is come: the morning is gone forth; the rod hath blossomed, pride hath budded.<br><a name="11">11</a>  Violence is risen up into a rod of wickedness: none of them [shall remain], nor of their multitude, nor of any of theirs: neither [shall there be] wailing for them.<br><a name="12">12</a>  The time is come, the day draweth near: let not the buyer rejoice, nor the seller mourn: for wrath [is] upon all the multitude thereof.<br><a name="13">13</a>  For the seller shall not return to that which is sold, although they were yet alive: for the vision [is] touching the whole multitude thereof, [which] shall not return; neither shall any strengthen himself in the iniquity of his life.<br><a name="14">14</a>  They have blown the trumpet, even to make all ready; but none goeth to the battle: for my wrath [is] upon all the multitude thereof.<br><a name="15">15</a>  The sword [is] without, and the pestilence and the famine within: he that [is] in the field shall die with the sword; and he that [is] in the city, famine and pestilence shall devour him.<br><a name="16">16</a>. But they that escape of them shall escape, and shall be on the mountains like doves of the valleys, all of them mourning, every one for his iniquity.<br><a name="17">17</a>  All hands shall be feeble, and all knees shall be weak [as] water.<br><a name="18">18</a>  They shall also gird [themselves] with sackcloth, and horror shall cover them; and shame [shall be] upon all faces, and baldness upon all their heads.<br><a name="19">19</a>  They shall cast their silver in the streets, and their gold shall be removed: their silver and their gold shall not be able to deliver them in the day of the wrath of the LORD: they shall not satisfy their souls, neither fill their bowels: because it is the stumblingblock of their iniquity.<br><a name="20">20</a>  As for the beauty of his ornament, he set it in majesty: but they made the images of their abominations [and] of their detestable things therein: therefore have I set it far from them.<br><a name="21">21</a>  And I will give it into the hands of the strangers for a prey, and to the wicked of the earth for a spoil; and they shall pollute it.<br><a name="22">22</a>  My face will I turn also from them, and they shall pollute my secret [place]: for the robbers shall enter into it, and defile it.<br><a name="23">23</a>. Make a chain: for the land is full of bloody crimes, and the city is full of violence.<br><a name="24">24</a>  Wherefore I will bring the worst of the heathen, and they shall possess their houses: I will also make the pomp of the strong to cease; and their holy places shall be defiled.<br><a name="25">25</a>  Destruction cometh; and they shall seek peace, and [there shall be] none.<br><a name="26">26</a>  Mischief shall come upon mischief, and rumour shall be upon rumour; then shall they seek a vision of the prophet; but the law shall perish from the priest, and counsel from the ancients.<br><a name="27">27</a>  The king shall mourn, and the prince shall be clothed with desolation, and the hands of the people of the land shall be troubled: I will do unto them after their way, and according to their deserts will I judge them; and they shall know that I [am] the LORD.<br><br>Go to <a href="eze8.htm#1">Ezekiel 8</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
