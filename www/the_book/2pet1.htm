<body bgcolor="e9c2a6"><a name="1"></a>2Peter   1<br> 1. Simon Peter, a servant and an apostle of Jesus Christ, to them that have obtained like precious faith with us through the righteousness of God and our Saviour Jesus Christ:<br><a name="2">2</a>  Grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of God, and of Jesus our Lord,<br><a name="3">3</a>  According as his divine power hath given unto us all things that [pertain] unto life and godliness, through the knowledge of him that hath called us to glory and virtue:<br><a name="4">4</a>  Whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises: that by these ye might be partakers of the divine nature, having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust.<br><a name="5">5</a>. And beside this, giving all diligence, add to your faith virtue; and to virtue knowledge;<br><a name="6">6</a>  And to knowledge temperance; and to temperance patience; and to patience godliness;<br><a name="7">7</a>  And to godliness brotherly kindness; and to brotherly kindness charity.<br><a name="8">8</a>  For if these things be in you, and abound, they make [you that ye shall] neither [be] barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ.<br><a name="9">9</a>  But he that lacketh these things is blind, and cannot see afar off, and hath forgotten that he was purged from his old sins.<br><a name="10">10</a>  Wherefore the rather, brethren, give diligence to make your calling and election sure: for if ye do these things, ye shall never fall:<br><a name="11">11</a>  For so an entrance shall be ministered unto you abundantly into the everlasting kingdom of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ.<br><a name="12">12</a>. Wherefore I will not be negligent to put you always in remembrance of these things, though ye know [them], and be established in the present truth.<br><a name="13">13</a>  Yea, I think it meet, as long as I am in this tabernacle, to stir you up by putting [you] in remembrance;<br><a name="14">14</a>  Knowing that shortly I must put off [this] my tabernacle, even as our Lord Jesus Christ hath shewed me.<br><a name="15">15</a>  Moreover I will endeavour that ye may be able after my decease to have these things always in remembrance.<br><a name="16">16</a>. For we have not followed cunningly devised fables, when we made known unto you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, but were eyewitnesses of his majesty.<br><a name="17">17</a>  For he received from God the Father honour and glory, when there came such a voice to him from the excellent glory, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.<br><a name="18">18</a>  And this voice which came from heaven we heard, when we were with him in the holy mount.<br><a name="19">19</a>. We have also a more sure word of prophecy; whereunto ye do well that ye take heed, as unto a light that shineth in a dark place, until the day dawn, and the day star arise in your hearts:<br><a name="20">20</a>  Knowing this first, that no prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation.<br><a name="21"> 21</a>  For the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man: but holy men of God spake [as they were] moved by the Holy Ghost.<br><br>Go to <a href="2pet2.htm#1">II Peter 2</a></html></body>
