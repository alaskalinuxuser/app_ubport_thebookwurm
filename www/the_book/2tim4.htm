2Timothy   4<br> 1. I charge [thee] therefore before God, and the Lord Jesus Christ, who shall judge the quick and the dead at his appearing and his kingdom;<br><a name="2">2</a>  Preach the word; be instant in season, out of season; reprove, rebuke, exhort with all longsuffering and doctrine.<br><a name="3">3</a>  For the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine; but after their own lusts shall they heap to themselves teachers, having itching ears;<br><a name="4">4</a>  And they shall turn away [their] ears from the truth, and shall be turned unto fables.<br><a name="5">5</a>  But watch thou in all things, endure afflictions, do the work of an evangelist, make full proof of thy ministry.<br><a name="6">6</a>  For I am now ready to be offered, and the time of my departure is at hand.<br><a name="7">7</a>  I have fought a good fight, I have finished [my] course, I have kept the faith:<br><a name="8">8</a>  Henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous judge, shall give me at that day: and not to me only, but unto all them also that love his appearing.<br><a name="9">9</a>. Do thy diligence to come shortly unto me:<br><a name="10">10</a>  For Demas hath forsaken me, having loved this present world, and is departed unto Thessalonica; Crescens to Galatia, Titus unto Dalmatia.<br><a name="11">11</a>  Only Luke is with me. Take Mark, and bring him with thee: for he is profitable to me for the ministry.<br><a name="12">12</a>  And Tychicus have I sent to Ephesus.<br><a name="13">13</a>  The cloke that I left at Troas with Carpus, when thou comest, bring [with thee], and the books, [but] especially the parchments.<br><a name="14">14</a>  Alexander the coppersmith did me much evil: the Lord reward him according to his works:<br><a name="15">15</a>  Of whom be thou ware also; for he hath greatly withstood our words.<br><a name="16">16</a>. At my first answer no man stood with me, but all [men] forsook me: [I pray God] that it may not be laid to their charge.<br><a name="17">17</a>  Notwithstanding the Lord stood with me, and strengthened me; that by me the preaching might be fully known, and [that] all the Gentiles might hear: and I was delivered out of the mouth of the lion.<br><a name="18">18</a>  And the Lord shall deliver me from every evil work, and will preserve [me] unto his heavenly kingdom: to whom [be] glory for ever and ever. Amen.<br><a name="19">19</a>  Salute Prisca and Aquila, and the household of Onesiphorus.<br><a name="20">20</a>  Erastus abode at Corinth: but Trophimus have I left at Miletum sick.<br><a name="21">21</a>  Do thy diligence to come before winter. Eubulus greeteth thee, and Pudens, and Linus, and Claudia, and all the brethren.<br><a name="22">22</a>  The Lord Jesus Christ [be] with thy spirit. Grace [be] with you.
