<dl><dd>I.C.3.<b> The Burden of Moab </b>(15:1-16:14)
<dt><b><i>1. The burden of Moab.<br>Because in the night Ar of Moab is laid waste, [and] brought to silence;<br>because in the night Kir of Moab is laid waste, [and] brought to silence;<br>
2 He is gone up to Bajith, and to Dibon, the high places, to weep:<br>Moab shall howl over Nebo, and over Medeba:<br>on all their heads [shall be] baldness, [and] every beard cut off.<br>
3 In their streets they shall gird themselves with sackcloth:<br>on the tops of their houses, and in their streets, every one shall howl, weeping abundantly.<br>
4 And Heshbon shall cry, and Elealeh:<br>their voice shall be heard [even] unto Jahaz: </i></b>{about 8 miles south}<b><i><br>therefore the armed soldiers of Moab shall cry out; his life shall be grievous unto him.</i></b></dt><dl>
<dt>Moab - A nation descended from Lot, through one of his daughters. (<a href="gen19.htm#36">Gen 19:36,37</a>)<dd>They occupied the region to the east of the Dead Sea.
<dt>in the night Ar... Kir... laid waste...- The fall of Moab is sudden and swift.<dd>Though 25 miles apart, both Ar and Kir fall in the same night.
<dt>he is gone up to... the high places, to weep...- In their distress, the Moabites cry out to their idols.<dd>But they will not help them (cp. <a href="isa16.htm#12">16:12</a>). Prominent high places were located at Bajith, Dibon, Nebo and Medeba. (The latter two were near the northern reaches of Moab. Dibon was near the River Arnon near the mid-point of the Dead Sea. The location of Bajith is presently unkown.)</dl>
<dt><b><i>5 My heart shall cry out for Moab;<br>his fugitives [shall flee] unto Zoar, an heifer of three years old:<br>for by the mounting up of Luhith with weeping shall they go it up;<br>for in the way of Horonaim they shall raise up a cry of destruction.<br>
6. For the waters of Nimrim shall be desolate:<br>for the hay is withered away, the grass faileth, there is no green thing.<br>
7 Therefore the abundance they have gotten, and that which they have laid up,<br>shall they carry away to the brook of the willows.<br>
8 For the cry is gone round about the borders of Moab;<br>the howling thereof unto Eglaim, and the howling thereof unto Beerelim.<br>
9 For the waters of Dimon shall be full of blood:<br>for I will bring more upon Dimon, lions upon him that escapeth of Moab, and upon the remnant of the land.</i></b></dt><dl>
<dt>my heart shall cry out for Moab...- Though the people of Moab worship false gods,<dd>the Lord, and His prophet weep for the troubles that are coming upon them (cp. <a href="isa16.htm#9">16:9</a>; <a href="jer48.htm#31">Jer 48:31-46</a>).
<dt>his fugitives shall flee unto Zoar - a city at the southern tip of the Dead Sea,<dd>on the border between Moab and Edom.
<dt>... an heifer of three years old - This phrase...<dd>A. may be descriptive of their cry, like a young heifer in fear (cp. <a href="jer48.htm#34">Jer 48:34</a>), or<dd>B. may be a name for a town, &quot;Eglath Shelishiyah&quot; [NASB]. If so, its location, like that of Luhith and Horonaim, is presently unknown, although, at the time, they were way points enroute to Zoar. 
<dt>in the way of Horonaim... a cry of destruction - The Assyrian (and later, Babylonian) armies<dd>would shout victoriously as they overran this place, which was evidently in the north, at some distance from Zoar (cp. <a href="jer48.htm#34">Jer 48:34</a>). The severity of the destruction is further testified by Eglaim and Beerelim, cities which were well known then, but which are also unknown to us.
<dt>for the waters of Dimon {probably Dibon} shall be full of blood...- The slaughter, coming from the north,<dd>would still be severe when it reached this river in the middle of the country.
<dt>the waters of Nimrim shall be desolate...- This stream, near the southern end of the Dead Sea,<dd>would be dried up, offering no refreshment to the refugees.
<dt>{their} abundance... laid up... to the brook of willows - Pursued and perishing from lack of water,<dd>the refugees would abandon their treasures in the struggle to preserve their lives. cp. <a href="jer48.htm#36">Jer 48:36</a>
<dt>I will bring more... lions upon him that escapeth...- Lions may refer both to fierce animals, and also to fierce kings.<dd>For example, the Lord sent lions among the gentiles who occupied the land of Israel, following the Assyrian invasion (eg., <a href="2kin17.htm#25">2Kin 17:25</a>). But later, the Moabites, who survived the Assyrian invasion, would be troubled by Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, after he devoured Israel (cp. <a href="jer50.htm#17">Jer 50:17</a>).<dt>Chapter 15 focuses on the 'near view' of the Burden of Moab. The destructions described here are matters of history.</dl>
