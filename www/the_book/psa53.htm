Corrupt are they, and have done abominable iniquity: [there is] none that doeth good.<br><a name="2">2</a>  God looked down from heaven upon the children of men, to see if there were [any] that did understand, that did seek God.<br><a name="3">3</a>  Every one of them is gone back: they are altogether become filthy; [there is] none that doeth good, no, not one.<br><a name="4">4</a>  Have the workers of iniquity no knowledge? who eat up my people [as] they eat bread: they have not called upon God.<br><a name="5">5</a>  There were they in great fear, [where] no fear was: for God hath scattered the bones of him that encampeth [against] thee: thou hast put [them] to shame, because God hath despised them.<br><a name="6">6</a>  Oh that the salvation of Israel [were come] out of Zion!
