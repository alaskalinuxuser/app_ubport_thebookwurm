1Samuel  23<br>1. Then they told David, saying, Behold, the Philistines fight against Keilah, and they rob the threshingfloors.<br><a name="2">2</a>  Therefore David enquired of the LORD, saying, Shall I go and smite these Philistines? And the LORD said unto David, Go, and smite the Philistines, and save Keilah.<br><a name="3">3</a>  And David's men said unto him, Behold, we be afraid here in Judah: how much more then if we come to Keilah against the armies of the Philistines?<br><a name="4">4</a>  Then David enquired of the LORD yet again. And the LORD answered him and said, Arise, go down to Keilah; for I will deliver the Philistines into thine hand.<br><a name="5">5</a>  So David and his men went to Keilah, and fought with the Philistines, and brought away their cattle, and smote them with a great slaughter. So David saved the inhabitants of Keilah.<br><a name="6">6</a>  And it came to pass, when Abiathar the son of Ahimelech fled to David to Keilah, [that] he came down [with] an ephod in his hand.<br><a name="7">7</a>. And it was told Saul that David was come to Keilah. And Saul said, God hath delivered him into mine hand; for he is shut in, by entering into a town that hath gates and bars.<br><a name="8">8</a>  And Saul called all the people together to war, to go down to Keilah, to besiege David and his men.<br><a name="9">9</a>  And David knew that Saul secretly practised mischief against him; and he said to Abiathar the priest, Bring hither the ephod.<br><a name="10">10</a>  Then said David, O LORD God of Israel, thy servant hath certainly heard that Saul seeketh to come to Keilah, to destroy the city for my sake.<br><a name="11">11</a>  Will the men of Keilah deliver me up into his hand? will Saul come down, as thy servant hath heard? O LORD God of Israel, I beseech thee, tell thy servant. And the LORD said, He will come down.<br><a name="12">12</a>  Then said David, Will the men of Keilah deliver me and my men into the hand of Saul? And the LORD said, They will deliver [thee] up.<br><a name="13">13</a>  Then David and his men, [which were] about six hundred, arose and departed out of Keilah, and went whithersoever they could go. And it was told Saul that David was escaped from Keilah; and he forbare to go forth.<br><a name="14">14</a>. And David abode in the wilderness in strong holds, and remained in a mountain in the wilderness of Ziph. And Saul sought him every day, but God delivered him not into his hand.<br><a name="15">15</a>  And David saw that Saul was come out to seek his life: and David [was] in the wilderness of Ziph in a wood.<br><a name="16">16</a>  And Jonathan Saul's son arose, and went to David into the wood, and strengthened his hand in God.<br><a name="17">17</a>  And he said unto him, Fear not: for the hand of Saul my father shall not find thee; and thou shalt be king over Israel, and I shall be next unto thee; and that also Saul my father knoweth.<br><a name="18">18</a>  And they two made a covenant before the LORD: and David abode in the wood, and Jonathan went to his house.<br><a name="19">19</a>. Then came up the Ziphites to Saul to Gibeah, saying, Doth not David hide himself with us in strong holds in the wood, in the hill of Hachilah, which [is] on the south of Jeshimon?<br><a name="20">20</a>  Now therefore, O king, come down according to all the desire of thy soul to come down; and our part [shall be] to deliver him into the king's hand.<br><a name="21">21</a>  And Saul said, Blessed [be] ye of the LORD; for ye have compassion on me.<br><a name="22">22</a>  Go, I pray you, prepare yet, and know and see his place where his haunt is, [and] who hath seen him there: for it is told me [that] he dealeth very subtilly.<br><a name="23">23</a>  See therefore, and take knowledge of all the lurking places where he hideth himself, and come ye again to me with the certainty, and I will go with you: and it shall come to pass, if he be in the land, that I will search him out throughout all the thousands of Judah.<br><a name="24">24</a>  And they arose, and went to Ziph before Saul: but David and his men [were] in the wilderness of Maon, in the plain on the south of Jeshimon.<br><a name="25">25</a>  Saul also and his men went to seek [him]. And they told David: wherefore he came down into a rock, and abode in the wilderness of Maon. And when Saul heard [that], he pursued after David in the wilderness of Maon.<br><a name="26">26</a>  And Saul went on this side of the mountain, and David and his men on that side of the mountain: and David made haste to get away for fear of Saul; for Saul and his men compassed David and his men round about to take them.<br><a name="27">27</a>  But there came a messenger unto Saul, saying, Haste thee, and come; for the Philistines have invaded the land.<br><a name="28">28</a>  Wherefore Saul returned from pursuing after David, and went against the Philistines: therefore they called that place Selahammahlekoth.<br><a name="29">29</a>  And David went up from thence, and dwelt in strong holds at Engedi.<br><br>Go to <a href="1sam24.htm#1">I Samuel 24</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
