Amos   5<br>1. Hear ye this word which I take up against you, [even] a lamentation, O house of Israel.<br><a name="2">2</a>  The virgin of Israel is fallen; she shall no more rise: she is forsaken upon her land; [there is] none to raise her up.<br><a name="3">3</a>  For thus saith the Lord GOD; The city that went out [by] a thousand shall leave an hundred, and that which went forth [by] an hundred shall leave ten, to the house of Israel.<br><a name="4">4</a>. For thus saith the LORD unto the house of Israel, Seek ye me, and ye shall live:<br><a name="5">5</a>  But seek not Bethel, nor enter into Gilgal, and pass not to Beersheba: for Gilgal shall surely go into captivity, and Bethel shall come to nought.<br><a name="6">6</a>  Seek the LORD, and ye shall live; lest he break out like fire in the house of Joseph, and devour [it], and [there be] none to quench [it] in Bethel.<br><a name="7">7</a>  Ye who turn judgment to wormwood, and leave off righteousness in the earth,<br><a name="8">8</a>  [Seek him] that maketh the seven stars and Orion, and turneth the shadow of death into the morning, and maketh the day dark with night: that calleth for the waters of the sea, and poureth them out upon the face of the earth: The LORD [is] his name:<br><a name="9">9</a>  That strengtheneth the spoiled against the strong, so that the spoiled shall come against the fortress.<br><a name="10">10</a>  They hate him that rebuketh in the gate, and they abhor him that speaketh uprightly.<br><a name="11">11</a>  Forasmuch therefore as your treading [is] upon the poor, and ye take from him burdens of wheat: ye have built houses of hewn stone, but ye shall not dwell in them; ye have planted pleasant vineyards, but ye shall not drink wine of them.<br><a name="12">12</a>  For I know your manifold transgressions and your mighty sins: they afflict the just, they take a bribe, and they turn aside the poor in the gate [from their right].<br><a name="13">13</a>  Therefore the prudent shall keep silence in that time; for it [is] an evil time.<br><a name="14">14</a>  Seek good, and not evil, that ye may live: and so the LORD, the God of hosts, shall be with you, as ye have spoken.<br><a name="15">15</a>  Hate the evil, and love the good, and establish judgment in the gate: it may be that the LORD God of hosts will be gracious unto the remnant of Joseph.<br><a name="16">16</a>. Therefore the LORD, the God of hosts, the Lord, saith thus; Wailing [shall be] in all streets; and they shall say in all the highways, Alas! alas! and they shall call the husbandman to mourning, and such as are skilful of lamentation to wailing.<br><a name="17">17</a>  And in all vineyards [shall be] wailing: for I will pass through thee, saith the LORD.<br><a name="18">18</a>  Woe unto you that desire the day of the LORD! to what end [is] it for you? the day of the LORD [is] darkness, and not light.<br><a name="19">19</a>  As if a man did flee from a lion, and a bear met him; or went into the house, and leaned his hand on the wall, and a serpent bit him.<br><a name="20">20</a>  [Shall] not the day of the LORD [be] darkness, and not light? even very dark, and no brightness in it?<br><a name="21">21</a>. I hate, I despise your feast days, and I will not smell in your solemn assemblies.<br><a name="22">22</a>  Though ye offer me burnt offerings and your meat offerings, I will not accept [them]: neither will I regard the peace offerings of your fat beasts.<br><a name="23">23</a>  Take thou away from me the noise of thy songs; for I will not hear the melody of thy viols.<br><a name="24">24</a>  But let judgment run down as waters, and righteousness as a mighty stream.<br><a name="25">25</a>  Have ye offered unto me sacrifices and offerings in the wilderness forty years, O house of Israel?<br><a name="26">26</a>  But ye have borne the tabernacle of your Moloch and Chiun your images, the star of your god, which ye made to yourselves.<br><a name="27">27</a>  Therefore will I cause you to go into captivity beyond Damascus, saith the LORD, whose name [is] The God of hosts.<br><br>Go to <a href="amos6.htm#1">Amos 6</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
