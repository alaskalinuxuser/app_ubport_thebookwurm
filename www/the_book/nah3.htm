Nahum   3<br>1. Woe to the bloody city! it [is] all full of lies [and] robbery; the prey departeth not;<br><a name="2">2</a>  The noise of a whip, and the noise of the rattling of the wheels, and of the pransing horses, and of the jumping chariots.<br><a name="3">3</a>  The horseman lifteth up both the bright sword and the glittering spear: and [there is] a multitude of slain, and a great number of carcases; and [there is] none end of [their] corpses; they stumble upon their corpses:<br><a name="4">4</a>  Because of the multitude of the whoredoms of the wellfavoured harlot, the mistress of witchcrafts, that selleth nations through her whoredoms, and families through her witchcrafts.<br><a name="5">5</a>  Behold, I [am] against thee, saith the LORD of hosts; and I will discover thy skirts upon thy face, and I will shew the nations thy nakedness, and the kingdoms thy shame.<br><a name="6">6</a>  And I will cast abominable filth upon thee, and make thee vile, and will set thee as a gazingstock.<br><a name="7">7</a>  And it shall come to pass, [that] all they that look upon thee shall flee from thee, and say, Nineveh is laid waste: who will bemoan her? whence shall I seek comforters for thee?<br><a name="8">8</a>. Art thou better than populous No, that was situate among the rivers, [that had] the waters round about it, whose rampart [was] the sea, [and] her wall [was] from the sea?<br><a name="9">9</a>  Ethiopia and Egypt [were] her strength, and [it was] infinite; Put and Lubim were thy helpers.<br><a name="10">10</a>  Yet [was] she carried away, she went into captivity: her young children also were dashed in pieces at the top of all the streets: and they cast lots for her honourable men, and all her great men were bound in chains.<br><a name="11">11</a>  Thou also shalt be drunken: thou shalt be hid, thou also shalt seek strength because of the enemy.<br><a name="12">12</a>  All thy strong holds [shall be like] fig trees with the firstripe figs: if they be shaken, they shall even fall into the mouth of the eater.<br><a name="13">13</a>  Behold, thy people in the midst of thee [are] women: the gates of thy land shall be set wide open unto thine enemies: the fire shall devour thy bars.<br><a name="14">14</a>  Draw thee waters for the siege, fortify thy strong holds: go into clay, and tread the morter, make strong the brickkiln.<br><a name="15">15</a>  There shall the fire devour thee; the sword shall cut thee off, it shall eat thee up like the cankerworm: make thyself many as the cankerworm, make thyself many as the locusts.<br><a name="16">16</a>  Thou hast multiplied thy merchants above the stars of heaven: the cankerworm spoileth, and flieth away.<br><a name="17">17</a>  Thy crowned [are] as the locusts, and thy captains as the great grasshoppers, which camp in the hedges in the cold day, [but] when the sun ariseth they flee away, and their place is not known where they [are].<br><a name="18">18</a>  Thy shepherds slumber, O king of Assyria: thy nobles shall dwell [in the dust]: thy people is scattered upon the mountains, and no man gathereth [them].<br><a name="19">19</a>  [There is] no healing of thy bruise; thy wound is grievous: all that hear the bruit of thee shall clap the hands over thee: for upon whom hath not thy wickedness passed continually?<br><br>End of Nahum.<br>Go to <a href="hab1.htm#1">Habbakuk 1</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
