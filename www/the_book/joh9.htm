And as [Jesus] passed by, he saw a man which was blind from [his] birth.<br><a name="2">2</a>  And his disciples asked him, saying, Master, who did sin, this man, or his parents, that he was born blind?<br><a name="3">3</a>  Jesus answered, Neither hath this man sinned, nor his parents: but that the works of God should be made manifest in him.<br><a name="4">4</a>  I must work the works of him that sent me, while it is day: the night cometh, when no man can work.<br><a name="5">5</a>  As long as I am in the world, I am the light of the world.<br><a name="6">6</a>  When he had thus spoken, he spat on the ground, and made clay of the spittle, and he anointed the eyes of the blind man with the clay,<br><a name="7">7</a>  And said unto him, Go, wash in the pool of Siloam, (which is by interpretation, Sent.) He went his way therefore, and washed, and came seeing.<br><a name="8">8</a>. The neighbours therefore, and they which before had seen him that he was blind, said, Is not this he that sat and begged?<br><a name="9">9</a>  Some said, This is he: others [said], He is like him: [but] he said, I am [he].<br><a name="10">10</a>  Therefore said they unto him, How were thine eyes opened?<br><a name="11">11</a>  He answered and said, A man that is called Jesus made clay, and anointed mine eyes, and said unto me, Go to the pool of Siloam, and wash: and I went and washed, and I received sight.<br><a name="12">12</a>  Then said they unto him, Where is he? He said, I know not.<br><a name="13">13</a>. They brought to the Pharisees him that aforetime was blind.<br><a name="14">14</a>  And it was the sabbath day when Jesus made the clay, and opened his eyes.<br><a name="15">15</a>  Then again the Pharisees also asked him how he had received his sight. He said unto them, He put clay upon mine eyes, and I washed, and do see.<br><a name="16">16</a>  Therefore said some of the Pharisees, This man is not of God, because he keepeth not the sabbath day. Others said, How can a man that is a sinner do such miracles? And there was a division among them.<br><a name="17">17</a>  They say unto the blind man again, What sayest thou of him, that he hath opened thine eyes? He said, He is a prophet.<br><a name="18">18</a>  But the Jews did not believe concerning him, that he had been blind, and received his sight, until they called the parents of him that had received his sight.<br><a name="19">19</a>  And they asked them, saying, Is this your son, who ye say was born blind? how then doth he now see?<br><a name="20">20</a>  His parents answered them and said, We know that this is our son, and that he was born blind:<br><a name="21">21</a>  But by what means he now seeth, we know not; or who hath opened his eyes, we know not: he is of age; ask him: he shall speak for himself.<br><a name="22">22</a>  These [words] spake his parents, because they feared the Jews: for the Jews had agreed already, that if any man did confess that he was Christ, he should be put out of the synagogue.<br><a name="23">23</a>  Therefore said his parents, He is of age; ask him.<br><a name="24">24</a>  Then again called they the man that was blind, and said unto him, Give God the praise: we know that this man is a sinner.<br><a name="25">25</a>  He answered and said, Whether he be a sinner [or no], I know not: one thing I know, that, whereas I was blind, now I see.<br><a name="26">26</a>  Then said they to him again, What did he to thee? how opened he thine eyes?<br><a name="27">27</a>  He answered them, I have told you already, and ye did not hear: wherefore would ye hear [it] again? will ye also be his disciples?<br><a name="28">28</a>  Then they reviled him, and said, Thou art his disciple; but we are Moses' disciples.<br><a name="29">29</a>  We know that God spake unto Moses: [as for] this [fellow], we know not from whence he is.<br><a name="30">30</a>  The man answered and said unto them, Why herein is a marvellous thing, that ye know not from whence he is, and [yet] he hath opened mine eyes.<br><a name="31">31</a>  Now we know that God heareth not sinners: but if any man be a worshipper of God, and doeth his will, him he heareth.<br><a name="32">32</a>  Since the world began was it not heard that any man opened the eyes of one that was born blind.<br><a name="33">33</a>  If this man were not of God, he could do nothing.<br><a name="34">34</a>  They answered and said unto him, Thou wast altogether born in sins, and dost thou teach us? And they cast him out.<br><a name="35">35</a>. Jesus heard that they had cast him out; and when he had found him, he said unto him, Dost thou believe on the Son of God?<br><a name="36">36</a>  He answered and said, Who is he, Lord, that I might believe on him?<br><a name="37">37</a>  And Jesus said unto him, Thou hast both seen him, and it is he that talketh with thee.<br><a name="38">38</a>  And he said, Lord, I believe. And he worshipped him.<br><a name="39">39</a>. And Jesus said, For judgment I am come into this world, that they which see not might see; and that they which see might be made blind.<br><a name="40">40</a>  And [some] of the Pharisees which were with him heard these words, and said unto him, Are we blind also?<br><a name="41">41</a>  Jesus said unto them, If ye were blind, ye should have no sin: but now ye say, We see; therefore your sin remaineth.<br><br>Go to <a href="joh10.htm#1">John 10</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
