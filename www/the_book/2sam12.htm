2Samuel  12<br> 1. And the LORD sent Nathan unto David. And he came unto him, and said unto him, There were two men in one city; the one rich, and the other poor.<br><a name="2">2</a>  The rich [man] had exceeding many flocks and herds:<br><a name="3">3</a>  But the poor [man] had nothing, save one little ewe lamb, which he had bought and nourished up: and it grew up together with him, and with his children; it did eat of his own meat, and drank of his own cup, and lay in his bosom, and was unto him as a daughter.<br><a name="4">4</a>  And there came a traveller unto the rich man, and he spared to take of his own flock and of his own herd, to dress for the wayfaring man that was come unto him; but took the poor man's lamb, and dressed it for the man that was come to him.<br><a name="5">5</a>  And David's anger was greatly kindled against the man; and he said to Nathan, [As] the LORD liveth, the man that hath done this [thing] shall surely die:<br><a name="6">6</a>  And he shall restore the lamb fourfold, because he did this thing, and because he had no pity.<br><a name="7">7</a>  And Nathan said to David, Thou [art] the man. Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, I anointed thee king over Israel, and I delivered thee out of the hand of Saul;<br><a name="8">8</a>  And I gave thee thy master's house, and thy master's wives into thy bosom, and gave thee the house of Israel and of Judah; and if [that had been] too little, I would moreover have given unto thee such and such things.<br><a name="9">9</a>  Wherefore hast thou despised the commandment of the LORD, to do evil in his sight? thou hast killed Uriah the Hittite with the sword, and hast taken his wife [to be] thy wife, and hast slain him with the sword of the children of Ammon.<br><a name="10">10</a>  Now therefore the sword shall never depart from thine house; because thou hast despised me, and hast taken the wife of Uriah the Hittite to be thy wife.<br><a name="11">11</a>  Thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will raise up evil against thee out of thine own house, and I will take thy wives before thine eyes, and give [them] unto thy neighbour, and he shall lie with thy wives in the sight of this sun.<br><a name="12">12</a>  For thou didst [it] secretly: but I will do this thing before all Israel, and before the sun.<br><a name="13">13</a>  And David said unto Nathan, I have sinned against the LORD. And Nathan said unto David, The LORD also hath put away thy sin; thou shalt not die.<br><a name="14">14</a>  Howbeit, because by this deed thou hast given great occasion to the enemies of the LORD to blaspheme, the child also [that is] born unto thee shall surely die.<br><a name="15">15</a>. And Nathan departed unto his house. And the LORD struck the child that Uriah's wife bare unto David, and it was very sick.<br><a name="16">16</a>  David therefore besought God for the child; and David fasted, and went in, and lay all night upon the earth.<br><a name="17">17</a>  And the elders of his house arose, [and went] to him, to raise him up from the earth: but he would not, neither did he eat bread with them.<br><a name="18">18</a>  And it came to pass on the seventh day, that the child died. And the servants of David feared to tell him that the child was dead: for they said, Behold, while the child was yet alive, we spake unto him, and he would not hearken unto our voice: how will he then vex himself, if we tell him that the child is dead?<br><a name="19">19</a>  But when David saw that his servants whispered, David perceived that the child was dead: therefore David said unto his servants, Is the child dead? And they said, He is dead.<br><a name="20">20</a>  Then David arose from the earth, and washed, and anointed [himself], and changed his apparel, and came into the house of the LORD, and worshipped: then he came to his own house; and when he required, they set bread before him, and he did eat.<br><a name="21">21</a>  Then said his servants unto him, What thing [is] this that thou hast done? thou didst fast and weep for the child, [while it was] alive; but when the child was dead, thou didst rise and eat bread.<br><a name="22">22</a>  And he said, While the child was yet alive, I fasted and wept: for I said, Who can tell [whether] GOD will be gracious to me, that the child may live?<br><a name="23">23</a>  But now he is dead, wherefore should I fast? can I bring him back again? I shall go to him, but he shall not return to me.<br><a name="24">24</a>  And David comforted Bathsheba his wife, and went in unto her, and lay with her: and she bare a son, and he called his name Solomon: and the LORD loved him.<br><a name="25">25</a>  And he sent by the hand of Nathan the prophet; and he called his name Jedidiah, because of the LORD.<br><a name="26">26</a>. And Joab fought against Rabbah of the children of Ammon, and took the royal city.<br><a name="27">27</a>  And Joab sent messengers to David, and said, I have fought against Rabbah, and have taken the city of waters.<br><a name="28">28</a>  Now therefore gather the rest of the people together, and encamp against the city, and take it: lest I take the city, and it be called after my name.<br><a name="29">29</a>  And David gathered all the people together, and went to Rabbah, and fought against it, and took it.<br><a name="30">30</a>  And he took their king's crown from off his head, the weight whereof [was] a talent of gold with the precious stones: and it was [set] on David's head. And he brought forth the spoil of the city in great abundance.<br><a name="31">31</a>  And he brought forth the people that [were] therein, and put [them] under saws, and under harrows of iron, and under axes of iron, and made them pass through the brickkiln: and thus did he unto all the cities of the children of Ammon. So David and all the people returned unto Jerusalem.<br><br>Go to <a href="2sam13.htm#1">II Samuel 13</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
