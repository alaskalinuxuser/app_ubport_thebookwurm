<dt><b><i>2:1 But there were false prophets also among the people </b></i>{cp. <a href="deu13.htm#1">Deut 13:1-3</a>; <a href="jer14.htm#13">Jer 14:13-15</a>}<i><b>, <br>even as there shall be false teachers among you </b></i>{cp. <a href="mat24.htm#5">Mat 24:5,24</a>; <a href="1tim4.htm#1">1Tim 4:1-3</a>}<i><b>, <br>who privily </b></i>{ie., secretly, craftily}<i><b> shall bring in damnable </i></b>{GK=apoleia}<i><b> heresies, <br>even denying the Lord that bought them, and bring upon themselves swift destruction</i></b> {GK=apoleia}.</dt><dl>
<dt>false teachers {GK=pseudodidaskolos}- those who promote false doctrine (GK=didaskalia}.
<dd>Though aware of the Truth, they teach what people want to hear. <a href="2tim4.htm#3">2Tim 4:3,4</a>
<dt>damnable {GK=apoleia, destructive} heresies-<ul>
<li>ie., teachings which undermine the foundational Truths of the Faith.
<li>eg., ''denying {GK= arnemai, to contradict, to renounce} the Lord {GK=despotes, the absolute authority} that bought them''- <br>In refusing to submit to Christ's authority, they contradict the Person and work of Christ with ''another gospel'' (cp. <a href="2cor11.htm#4">2Cor 11:4</a>; <a href="gal1.htm#6">Gal 1:6,7</a>). Christ died for the sins of the whole world (<a href="2cor5.htm#14">2Cor 5:14,15</a>; <a href="1joh2.htm#2">1Joh 2:2</a>), but there is no redemption for those who renounce the ransom that He paid for them (<a href="heb2.htm#3">Heb 2:3</a>). Christ paid the ransom for 'all,' but 'many' will be saved (<a href="mat20.htm#28">Mat 20:28</a>).</ul>
<dt>swift {sudden} destruction - will overtake teachers of destructive heresies and their followers. <a href="heb10.htm#26">Heb 10:26-31</a></dl>
<dt><b><i>2:2 And many shall follow their pernicious ways </b></i>{GK=apoleia, destroying [ways]}<i><b>; <br>by reason of whom the way of truth shall be evil spoken of </b></i>{GK=blasphemeo, blasphemed, reviled}<i><b>.<br>
2:3 And through covetousness shall they with feigned words make merchandise of you:</b></i>
<dd>{feigned- GK=plastos, plastic, formed; ie., words molded to suit the ears of the hearers; cf. <a href="2pet1.htm#16">1:16</a>}<i><b><dt>
whose judgment now of a long time lingereth not, <br>and their damnation </b></i>{GK=apoleia, destruction}<i><b> slumbereth not</i></b> {ie., will not be delayed}.</dt><dl>
<dt>This urgent warning, in Peter's last words to the Church, 
<dt>is mirrored by Paul, in his last words to the church at Ephesus, in Acts 20 -<ul>
<li>Paul addressed the leaders, using all three NT words for church leaders:<ol type="a">
<li>elders [<a href="act20.htm#17">Acts 20:17</a>] - GK=presbuteros.
<li>overseers [<a href="act20.htm#28">Acts 20:28</a>] - GK=episcopos, bishops.
<li>tend(ers) [Acts 20:28, 'feed' in KJV] - GK=poimaino, shepherd, pastor.</ol>
<li>Paul's manner of life and ministry [<a href="act20.htm#17">Acts 20:17-27</a>]<dd>(contrast the ways of false teachers, <a href="2pet2.htm#1" target="lwr_lt">v.1-3</a>.)</dd>
<li>Paul's message of warning-<ol type="1">
<li>Take heed {'be constantly maintaining a careful watch... to guard...' [Wuest]} -<ol type="a">
<li>to your responsibility [<a href="act20.htm#28">Acts 20:28</a>] <br>
- - given to you by the Holy Spirit<br>
- - for the well-being of His Church...  the flock of God...<dd>those who are purchased with His blood. (cp. 'bought', <a href="2pet2.htm#1" target="lwr_lt">v.1</a>)</dd>
<li>grievous {'savage' [NIV]} wolves <i>shall enter in</i> among you... [<a href="act20.htm#29">Acts 20:29</a>]<br>
Error would enter from outside the church (eg., worldly philosophy, pagan religion).<dd>(cp. 'destructive heresies... pernicious ways', <a href="2pet2.htm#1" target="lwr_lt">v.1,2</a>)</dd>
<li> men <i>shall arise of yourselves</i>... [<a href="act20.htm#30">Acts 20:30</a>] <br>
Error would be promoted from within the church, by false teachers -<br>
- - speaking perverse {ie., distorted} things (cp. <a href="2pet3.htm#16">2Pet 3:16</a>)...<br>
- - to draw disciples <i>after themselves</i> (ie., to gain a following for themselves)...<dd>
...not submitting themselves to the authority of the absolute Lord (<a href="2pet2.htm#1" target="lwr_lt">v.1</a>),</dd><dd>
...selling, for their own gain, people for whom Christ paid with His own blood (<a href="2pet2.htm#3" target="lwr_lt">v.3</a>).</dd></ol>
<li>watch [<a href="act20.htm#31">Acts 20:31</a>] (cp. <a href="1pet5.htm#8">1Pet 5:8</a>)
<li>remember [<a href="act20.htm#31">Acts 20:31</a>] (cp. <a href="2pet1.htm#12">2Pet1:12-15</a>)
<li>I commend you to God... and to the Word... [<a href="act20.htm#32">Acts 20:32</a>] which is able -<br>
...to build you up (ie., maturity in the Faith, <a href="1pet2.htm#2">1Pet 2:2</a>; <a href="2pet1.htm#2">2Pet 1:2-7</a>),<br>
...to give you an inheritance (ie., our hope &amp; confidence in the Faith, <a href="2pet1.htm#8">2Pet 1:8-11</a>).</ol></ul>
<dt>Peter and Paul warn that 'there <i>shall</i> be false teachers'-
<dd>Jude says they are already present. (<a href="jude1.htm#3">Jude 1:3,4</a>)
<dt>their destruction will come... surely... suddenly (<a href="2pet2.htm#1" target="lwr_lt">v.1,3</a>; cp. <a href="psa73.htm">Psa 73</a>)-
<dd>Peter gives three examples from Scripture of God's dealing with the wicked (in <a href="2pet2.htm#4" target="lwr_lt">v.4-9</a>).</dl>
<dt><b><i>2:4 For if God spared not the angels that sinned, but cast [them] down to hell, <br>and delivered [them] into chains of darkness, to be reserved unto judgment;<br>
2:5 And spared not the old world, but saved Noah the eighth [person], a preacher of righteousness, <br>bringing in the flood upon the world of the ungodly;<br>
2:6 And turning the cities of Sodom and Gomorrha into ashes condemned [them] with an overthrow, <br>making [them] an ensample unto those that after should live ungodly;<br>
2:7 And delivered just Lot, vexed with the filthy conversation </b></i>{ie., lifestyle}<i><b> of the wicked:<br>
2:8 (For that righteous man dwelling among them, <br>in seeing and hearing, vexed [his] righteous soul from day to day with [their] unlawful deeds;)<br>
2:9 The Lord knoweth how to deliver the godly out of temptations, <br>and to reserve the unjust unto the day of judgment to be punished:</i></b></dt><dl>
<dt>God spared not {ie., did not withhold judgment upon} --
<dt>A. the angels that sinned (<a href="2pet2.htm#4" target="lwr_lt">v.4</a>)- [moved by Satan's rebellion (see <a href="rev12.htm#7">Rev 12:7-9</a>).]
<dd>[This does <i>not</i> refer to <a href="gen6.htm#1">Gen 6:1-5</a> which relates to fallen man, not to fallen angels.]<ul>
<li>cast down to 'hell'- GK=tartarus. This is neither 'sheol' nor 'hades' (the place of disembodied human spirits) nor 'gehenna' ('hell-fire'), but a distinct place of confinement where the wicked angels await final judgment.
<li>delivered into 'chains'- GK=seira. cp. the GK word 'seiros' meaning 'pits, caves.' cp. <a href="jude1.htm#6">Jude 1:6</a> 
<li>reserved {ie., kept, guarded} unto judgment.
<dd>These imprisoned angels (demons) will be released briefly during the Tribulation period (<a href="rev9.htm#1">Rev 9:1-3,14-15</a>), prior to their final doom (<a href="rev20.htm#10">Rev 20:10</a>; <a href="mat25.htm#41">Mat 25:41</a>).</ul>
<dt>B. the wicked men of Noah's day (<a href="2pet2.htm#5" target="lwr_lt">v.5</a>; <a href="gen6.htm#5">Gen 6:5-8</a>) - [moved by worldly corruption]
<dd>Every air breathing creature perished in the flood. 
<dd>But God saved Noah and his family (totalling eight persons, <a href="1pet3.htm#20">1Pet 3:20</a>).
<dd>Noah pictures the 'elect' of the Tribulation period, who are saved <i>through</i> the judgment.
<dt>C. the cities of Sodom &amp; Gomorrah (<a href="2pet2.htm#6" target="lwr_lt">v.6-8</a>; <a href="gen19.htm">Gen ch. 19</a>)- [moved by fleshly lusts]
<dd>...God condemned what ungodly men approved. (cp. <a href="rom1.htm#18">Rom 1:18-32</a>)
<dd>But God delivered Lot, who was 'just' and 'righteous.'<ul>
<li>Lot, like Abraham, was 'justified' by faith, not by works (cp. <a href="rom4.htm#2">Rom 4:2-5</a>).
<li>Lot's inner man was 'vexed' {ie., troubled, tormented} by the moral filth around him.<br>
Lot's life, of compromise with the world, denied what he believed in his heart.<br>
- - His testimony was a mockery (<a href="gen19.htm#14">Gen 19:14</a>).<br>
- - His prayers were misdirected (<a href="gen19.htm#7">Gen 19:7,18-20</a>).
<dd>(cf. Abraham's walk with the Lord, and his intercession in behalf of Lot.)</dd>
<dd>cf. Lot's wife, who was comfortable in the world, and did not believe God's Word.</dd>
<li>Lot pictures the Church, raptured out of the world prior to the judgment.</ul>
<dt>These 3 examples demonstrate that the Lord 'knows how' (<a href="2pet2.htm#9" target="lwr_lt">v.9</a>) -<ul>
<li>to deliver His own. cp.  cp. <a href="psa34.htm#15">Psa 34:15-19</a>; <a href="1cor10.htm#13">1Cor 10:13</a>; <a href="1the5.htm#9">1The 5:9</a>
<dd>Note the important role of God's Word in keeping His children. <a href="joh17.htm#14">Joh 17:14-17</a></dd>
<li>to preserve the unjust for judgment. cp. <a href="mat13.htm#24">Mat 13:24-30,36-43</a>; <a href="rev20.htm#11">Rev 20:11-15</a></ul></dl>
<dt><b><i>2:10 But chiefly them that walk after the flesh in the lust of uncleanness, and despise government. <br>Presumptuous [are they], selfwilled, they are not afraid to speak evil of dignities.<br>
2:11 Whereas angels, which are greater in power and might, <br>bring not railing accusation against them before the Lord.<br>

<dt>The Motivation of false teachers (<a href="2pet2.htm#10" target="lwr_lt">v.10-16</a>):<br><i> A false premise, a false way </i>--<ol type="A">
<li>They despise government(s) - GK=kuriotes, dominion, lordship. cp. <a href="2pet2.htm#10" target="lwr_lt">v.10-12</a>; <a href="jude1.htm#8">Jude 1:8</a><br>
ie., ''They despise... that which God has ordained.'' [McGee]
cp. <a href="psa2.htm#1">Psa 2:1-3</a>; <a href="eph1.htm#15">Eph 1:15-23</a><ol type="a">
<li>Their stance is characteristic of them, for they are-<ul>
<li>presumptious- ie., daring, bold, arrogant
<li>self-willed- GK=authades {from 'autos' + 'hedones'}, lit., 'self-pleasing,' 'self-pleasured.'
<li>without fear... of dignities {GK=doxa, glories, worthies, ie., those who are to be held in honor}.<br>Peter does not identify these dignities. They may include church leaders, good angels, bad angels, God or Satan (cp. <a href="jude1.htm#8">Jude 1:8-10</a>).<br>The point is that they consider no authority higher than themselves. cp. <a href="2tim3.htm#2">2Tim 3:2-4</a></ul>
<li>Their stance is 'irrational' or 'unreasonable' {the meaning of 'brute,' <a href="2pet2.htm#12" target="lwr_lt">v.12</a>}.<br>
They are 'natural,' not 'spiritual.' Being spiritually dead,...<br>
- - they cannot understand the things of God (<a href="1cor2.htm#14">1Cor 2:14</a>), and <br>
- - they remain in a condition of 'corruption.' cf. <a href="2pet1.htm#4">2Pet 1:4</a><br>
They are fit only 'to be taken' {lit., 'to be captured,' or 'coralled'} to destruction. <br>
Their attempts, to break down the fences that God has established, serve only to enclose  themselves in their own corruption.</ol>
<li>They walk after the flesh (<a href="2pet2.htm#10" target="lwr_lt">v.10,13-14</a>)--<ul>
<li>in the lust of uncleanness... unrighteousness... revelings {ie., luxurious debauchery},<br>
<li>in their own deceivings {GK=apate (plural form)} while they feast with you-<dd>
In <a href="jude1.htm#12">Jude 1:12</a>, the word 'love' {'charity', in KJV; GK=agape} is also plural {lit., 'feasts of loves'}. The 'love feasts' of believers were dual celebrations: (1) of God's love for us in Christ, and (2) of our response of love for Him and for each other. These were to be feasts of 'agape' upon 'agape.' But these deceivers had made them 'apate' upon 'apate' {deception upon deception}.<dt>
<li>beguiling {GK=deleazo, deceiving, enticing, baiting} unstable souls (cp. <a href="2pet2.htm#2" target="lwr_lt">v.2</a>).
<dd>They 'bait' ('allure', <a href="2pet2.htm#18" target="lwr_lt">v.18</a>) them, by appealing to their fleshly desires.</dd>
<li>exercising {GK=gumnazo} covetousness (ie., for their own gain, cp. <a href="2pet2.htm#3" target="lwr_lt">v.3</a>).</ul>
<dt>These are 'spots... blemishes... cursed children'. (cf. God's own dear children. <a href="eph5.htm#25">Eph 5:25-27</a>)<br>&nbsp;
<li>They follow ''the way {ie., course} of Balaam'' (<a href="2pet2.htm#15" target="lwr_lt">v.15,16</a>; see <a href="num22.htm#1">Num 22:1-41</a>) -<ul>
<li>who was a prophet for hire, serving the highest bidder, to satisfy his covetousness, cp. <a href="2pet2.htm#3" target="lwr_lt">v.3</a>).<br>
<li>which was 'madness' {'insanity'}. Even the dumb {'voiceless'} beast, upon which the prophet rode, recognized the irrational nature of Balaam's chosen path (cp. <a href="2pet2.htm#12" target="lwr_lt">v.12</a>).</ul>
[The 'way of Balaam' (v.15), 'the error of Balaam' (<a href="jude1.htm#11">Jude 1:11</a>), and 'the doctrine of Balaam' (<a href="rev2.htm#14">Rev 2:14</a>) represent three different aspects of that false prophet's foolishness. Balaam's 'way' was ministry for money (covetousness). His 'error' was in thinking that God must curse Israel for their sins. His doctrine was in teaching Balak (his customer) to cast a moral stumbling block before God's people.]</ol></dl>
<dt><b><i>2:17 These are wells without water, clouds that are carried with a tempest; <br>to whom the mist of darkness is reserved for ever.<br>
2:18 For when they speak great swelling [words] of vanity, <br>they allure through the lusts of the flesh, [through much] wantonness, <br>those that were clean escaped from them who live in error.</i></b></dt><dl>
<dt>The Ministry of false teachers (<a href="2pet2.htm#17" target="lwr_lt">v.17-19</a>):<dt><i> A false promise </i>--<ol type="A">
<li>of life - from 'wells without water.' cp. <a href="jude1.htm#12">Jude 1:12</a><dd>
These teachers speak eloquently, and with great appeal to the hearers' fleshly senses. But they have no 'living water' to share, because they have not found the Lord for themselves. cp. <a href="jer2.htm#13">Jer 2:13</a>; <a href="joh4.htm#10">Joh 4:10</a>; <a href="joh7.htm#38">7:38</a><dt>
<li>of liberty - from 'servants of corruption' who are themselves bound by fleshly lusts.<dd>
For example, some false teachers would comfort the guilty consciences, and condone the practices of those who embrace homosexuality.<br>
In doing so, they deny the clear teaching of God's Word, that -<dt><ul>
<li>Homosexual activity is sin. <a href="2pet2.htm#6" target="lwr_lt">v.6-9</a>; <a href="rom1.htm#18">Rom 1:18-32</a>
<li>The wages of sin is death. <a href="rom3.htm#23">Rom 3:23</a>; <a href="rom6.htm#23">6:23</a>
<dd>Note that this penalty applies to all kinds of sin, and to all people, for 'all have sinned.'</dd>
<li>In Christ, there is salvation from sin's penalty (<a href="rom1.htm#16">Rom 1:16-18</a>)
<dd>and from sin's power (<a href="2cor5.htm#17">2Cor 5:17</a>). cp. <a href="1cor6.htm#9">1Cor 6:9-11</a></dd></ul>
Having rejected this salvation for themselves (<a href="2pet2.htm#1" target="lwr_lt">v.1</a>), they remain dead in their own sins.
Their religiosity offers a false freedom from guilt (based on denial of sin), and denies the power of God to redeem and transform the sinner. cp. <a href="2tim3.htm#5">2Tim 3:5</a>; <a href="1joh1.htm#8">1Joh 1:8- 2:2</a></ol></dl>
<dt><b><i>2:19 While they promise them liberty, they themselves are the servants of corruption: <br>for of whom a man is overcome, of the same is he brought in bondage.<br>
2:20 For if after they have escaped the pollutions of the world <br>through the knowledge of the Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, <br>they are again entangled therein, and overcome, <br>the latter end is worse with them than the beginning.<br>
2:21 For it had been better for them not to have known the way of righteousness </b></i>{cp. <a href="2pet2.htm#15" target="lwr_lt">v.15</a>}<i><b>, <br>than, after they have known [it], to turn from the holy commandment delivered unto them.<br>
2:22 But it is happened unto them according to the true proverb, </b></i>{<a href="pro26.htm#11">Prov 26:11</a>}<i><b><br>The dog [is] turned to his own vomit again; <br>and the sow that was washed to her wallowing in the mire.</i></b></dt><dl>
<dt>The Muck of false teachers (<a href="2pet2.htm#19" target="lwr_lt">v.19-22</a>):
<dt><i>False pretense exposed... </i>By nature, they are corrupt &amp; polluted. --<ol type="A">
<li>servants of corruption- who are in bondage to sin. cp. <a href="joh8.htm#34">Joh 8:34</a>; <a href="rom6.htm#16">Rom 6:16</a>
<li>escapees from pollution- who are again entangled in it.<dd>
They had a thorough intellectual understanding of the Gospel, which was morally beneficial. They considered themselves to have 'full knowledge' {GK=epignosis} concerning Christ and the way of righteousness.<br>
But they had never known Jesus Christ personally...<ul>
<li>as their Savior.- Therefore, they remained spiritually dead,<dd>and had not escaped from corruption (<a href="2pet1.htm#4">1:4</a>; <a href="2pet2.htm#12" target="lwr_lt">2:12</a>).</dd>
<li>as their Lord.- Therefore, they were not surrendered to His authority.<dd><a href="luk6.htm#46">Luk 6:46</a>; <a href="mat7.htm#21">Mat 7:21-23</a></dd></ul>
Nevertheless, their religious moral 'values' did set them apart from some of the defilements of the world, though they remained in their sin. For example, such teachers may encourage their followers to forsake homosexual promiscuity in favor of a 'committed loving homosexual relationship.' Those who heed this counsel may enjoy certain health benefits. Yet, they remain entangled in pollution.<dt>
<li>knowers of the truth- who turned back from it. (<a href="2pet2.htm#20" target="lwr_lt">v.20b-22</a>)<ul>
<li>It would have been better for them not to have known... <br>cp. <a href="mat11.htm#23">Mat 11:23,24</a>; <a href="luk12.htm#47">Luk 12:47,48</a>; <a href="heb6.htm#4">Heb 6:4-8</a>; <a href="heb10.htm#26">10:26-29</a>
<li>It was natural for them to return to their place.<blockquote>
''The sheep returns to the Shepherd (<a href="1pet2.htm#25">1Pet 2:25</a>); the sow to the mire (<a href="2pet2.htm#22" target="lwr_lt">v.22</a>). The respective verbs are active and passive. The sow returns of its own will; the sheep is caused to return.'' [GWms]</blockquote>
The prodigal son, being a son, does not belong in the pigpen, and finds himself drawn back to his Father. The 'prodigal pig,' being a pig, is not at home in the Father's house, and so, returns to wallow in the muck. [J.V.McGee amplifies the story of the prodigal son (<a href="luk15.htm#11">Luk 15:11-22</a>) with the story of a 'prodigal pig' who, having heard the boy's testimony of the glories of his Father's house, accompanies him there. But having a heart that longs for muck, he soon returns to his father's pigpen.]<br>
