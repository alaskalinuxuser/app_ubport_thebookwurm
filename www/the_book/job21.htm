Job  21<br>1. But Job answered and said,<br><a name="2">2</a>  Hear diligently my speech, and let this be your consolations.<br><a name="3">3</a>  Suffer me that I may speak; and after that I have spoken, mock on.<br><a name="4">4</a>  As for me, [is] my complaint to man? and if [it were so], why should not my spirit be troubled?<br><a name="5">5</a>  Mark me, and be astonished, and lay [your] hand upon [your] mouth.<br><a name="6">6</a>  Even when I remember I am afraid, and trembling taketh hold on my flesh.<br><a name="7">7</a>. Wherefore do the wicked live, become old, yea, are mighty in power?<br><a name="8">8</a>  Their seed is established in their sight with them, and their offspring before their eyes.<br><a name="9">9</a>  Their houses [are] safe from fear, neither [is] the rod of God upon them.<br><a name="10">10</a>  Their bull gendereth, and faileth not; their cow calveth, and casteth not her calf.<br><a name="11">11</a>  They send forth their little ones like a flock, and their children dance.<br><a name="12">12</a>  They take the timbrel and harp, and rejoice at the sound of the organ.<br><a name="13">13</a>  They spend their days in wealth, and in a moment go down to the grave.<br><a name="14">14</a>  Therefore they say unto God, Depart from us; for we desire not the knowledge of thy ways.<br><a name="15">15</a>  What [is] the Almighty, that we should serve him? and what profit should we have, if we pray unto him?<br><a name="16">16</a>  Lo, their good [is] not in their hand: the counsel of the wicked is far from me.<br><a name="17">17</a>. How oft is the candle of the wicked put out! and [how oft] cometh their destruction upon them! [God] distributeth sorrows in his anger.<br><a name="18">18</a>  They are as stubble before the wind, and as chaff that the storm carrieth away.<br><a name="19">19</a>  God layeth up his iniquity for his children: he rewardeth him, and he shall know [it].<br><a name="20">20</a>  His eyes shall see his destruction, and he shall drink of the wrath of the Almighty.<br><a name="21">21</a>  For what pleasure [hath] he in his house after him, when the number of his months is cut off in the midst?<br><a name="22">22</a>  Shall [any] teach God knowledge? seeing he judgeth those that are high.<br><a name="23">23</a>  One dieth in his full strength, being wholly at ease and quiet.<br><a name="24">24</a>  His breasts are full of milk, and his bones are moistened with marrow.<br><a name="25">25</a>  And another dieth in the bitterness of his soul, and never eateth with pleasure.<br><a name="26">26</a>  They shall lie down alike in the dust, and the worms shall cover them.<br><a name="27">27</a>. Behold, I know your thoughts, and the devices [which] ye wrongfully imagine against me.<br><a name="28">28</a>  For ye say, Where [is] the house of the prince? and where [are] the dwelling places of the wicked?<br><a name="29">29</a>  Have ye not asked them that go by the way? and do ye not know their tokens,<br><a name="30">30</a>  That the wicked is reserved to the day of destruction? they shall be brought forth to the day of wrath.<br><a name="31">31</a>  Who shall declare his way to his face? and who shall repay him [what] he hath done?<br><a name="32">32</a>  Yet shall he be brought to the grave, and shall remain in the tomb.<br><a name="33">33</a>  The clods of the valley shall be sweet unto him, and every man shall draw after him, as [there are] innumerable before him.<br><a name="34">34</a>  How then comfort ye me in vain, seeing in your answers there remaineth falsehood?<br><br>Go to <a href="job22.htm#1">Job 22</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
