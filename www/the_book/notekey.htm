<center><b> Keys to Understanding Scripture:</b></center>
<ol type="1">
 <li>Seek God's Face.  As His Spirit moved holy men of God to record the words of Scripture, only the Holy Spirit can make hearts holy to receive them. Only He can breathe into us Life and understanding. (<a href="1cor2.htm#9">1Cor 2:9-14</a>;  <a href="joh16.htm#13">John 16:13,14</a>;  <a href="dan9.htm#3">Dan 9:3</a>)
<li>Search the Scriptures.  No scripture is of &quot;private interpretation&quot;.  Scripture must be compared with scripture.  Therefore, do not neglect the cross references in the notes that follow. The scripture references form the text of this commentary. (They should not be set aside as mere footnotes). All notes supplied by this compiler should be regarded simply as links from one scripture to another. (<a href="joh5.htm#39">John 5:39</a>;  <a href="2pet1.htm#20">2Pet 1:20,21</a>)
<li>Set Your Heart to Obey His Word.  (<a href="joh7.htm#16">John 7:16-18</a>;  <a href="joh14.htm#21">John 14:21</a>;  <a href="luk6.htm#46">Luke 6:46-49</a>)<br>&nbsp;</ol>

<center><b>Keys to using the Notes:</b></center>
<p>These notes have been assembled from personal Bible study.  They are not meant to be a polished product. Rather the notes are meant to provide you with a resource which will help you come to your own understanding of the scripture text.   
<p>Normally, the Notes will display in the large upper window.
<p>Generally, the displayed note page deals with one Bible chapter. 
At the top of the page, there is a link to the scripture passage under consideration. It is suggested that you Click this link to display the text in the Lower Left window. You should read carefully through the scripture passage more than once. If questions or insights come to mind as you read, write them down with pencil &amp; paper. When you finish reading the scripture passage, study the Notes. Look for answers to your questions. Compare your insights with the Notes discussion. You can scroll through the scripture text as needed during the study.
<p>In the notes, the Bible verses (in the chapter under study) are shown in <b><i>bold italics</i></b> to set it apart from other text. 
<p>The note following each verse (or group of verses) will point out and discuss important words and phrases from the passage. 
<p>Since the best Bible commentary is the Bible itself, you should consider the notes as a framework by which to compare Scripture with Scripture. The frequent scripture reference links are the heart of this study. When you click on these links, the linked passage will usually display in the Lower Right window. (If the link is to a verse in the chapter under study, it will display in the Lower Left window.) You may scroll the text to see the context.
<p>Occasionally, there are links to other resources, or to relevant Book Notes at other Bible books or chapters. Some of these resources may display in the primary (upper) window. To return to the original chapter under study, use the Book Notes button, or the Book Notes link in the Resource Menu. Another option may be to open another instance of 'The Book' in a new browser window (or, Tab), then use the Book Notes button to navigate to the supplemental note (referenced in the link). This prevents disruption of the original study, and facilitates comparison of the passages.
