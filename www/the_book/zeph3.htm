Zephaniah   3<br> 1. Woe to her that is filthy and polluted, to the oppressing city!<br><a name="2">2</a>  She obeyed not the voice; she received not correction; she trusted not in the LORD; she drew not near to her God.<br><a name="3">3</a>  Her princes within her [are] roaring lions; her judges [are] evening wolves; they gnaw not the bones till the morrow.<br><a name="4">4</a>  Her prophets [are] light [and] treacherous persons: her priests have polluted the sanctuary, they have done violence to the law.<br><a name="5">5</a>  The just LORD [is] in the midst thereof; he will not do iniquity: every morning doth he bring his judgment to light, he faileth not; but the unjust knoweth no shame.<br><a name="6">6</a>  I have cut off the nations: their towers are desolate; I made their streets waste, that none passeth by: their cities are destroyed, so that there is no man, that there is none inhabitant.<br><a name="7">7</a>  I said, Surely thou wilt fear me, thou wilt receive instruction; so their dwelling should not be cut off, howsoever I punished them: but they rose early, [and] corrupted all their doings.<br><a name="8">8</a>. Therefore wait ye upon me, saith the LORD, until the day that I rise up to the prey: for my determination [is] to gather the nations, that I may assemble the kingdoms, to pour upon them mine indignation, [even] all my fierce anger: for all the earth shall be devoured with the fire of my jealousy.<br><a name="9">9</a>  For then will I turn to the people a pure language, that they may all call upon the name of the LORD, to serve him with one consent.<br><a name="10">10</a>  From beyond the rivers of Ethiopia my suppliants, [even] the daughter of my dispersed, shall bring mine offering.<br><a name="11">11</a>  In that day shalt thou not be ashamed for all thy doings, wherein thou hast transgressed against me: for then I will take away out of the midst of thee them that rejoice in thy pride, and thou shalt no more be haughty because of my holy mountain.<br><a name="12">12</a>  I will also leave in the midst of thee an afflicted and poor people, and they shall trust in the name of the LORD.<br><a name="13">13</a>  The remnant of Israel shall not do iniquity, nor speak lies; neither shall a deceitful tongue be found in their mouth: for they shall feed and lie down, and none shall make [them] afraid.<br><a name="14">14</a>. Sing, O daughter of Zion; shout, O Israel; be glad and rejoice with all the heart, O daughter of Jerusalem.<br><a name="15">15</a>  The LORD hath taken away thy judgments, he hath cast out thine enemy: the king of Israel, [even] the LORD, [is] in the midst of thee: thou shalt not see evil any more.<br><a name="16">16</a>  In that day it shall be said to Jerusalem, Fear thou not: [and to] Zion, Let not thine hands be slack.<br><a name="17">17</a>  The LORD thy God in the midst of thee [is] mighty; he will save, he will rejoice over thee with joy; he will rest in his love, he will joy over thee with singing.<br><a name="18">18</a>  I will gather [them that are] sorrowful for the solemn assembly, [who] are of thee, [to whom] the reproach of it [was] a burden.<br><a name="19">19</a>  Behold, at that time I will undo all that afflict thee: and I will save her that halteth, and gather her that was driven out; and I will get them praise and fame in every land where they have been put to shame.<br><a name="20">20</a>  At that time will I bring you [again], even in the time that I gather you: for I will make you a name and a praise among all people of the earth, when I turn back your captivity before your eyes, saith the LORD.<br><br>End of Zephaniah.<br>Go to <a href="hag1.htm#1">Haggai 1</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
