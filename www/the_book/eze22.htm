Ezekiel  22<br>1. Moreover the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,<br><a name="2">2</a>  Now, thou son of man, wilt thou judge, wilt thou judge the bloody city? yea, thou shalt shew her all her abominations.<br><a name="3">3</a>  Then say thou, Thus saith the Lord GOD, The city sheddeth blood in the midst of it, that her time may come, and maketh idols against herself to defile herself.<br><a name="4">4</a>  Thou art become guilty in thy blood that thou hast shed; and hast defiled thyself in thine idols which thou hast made; and thou hast caused thy days to draw near, and art come [even] unto thy years: therefore have I made thee a reproach unto the heathen, and a mocking to all countries.<br><a name="5">5</a>  [Those that be] near, and [those that be] far from thee, shall mock thee, [which art] infamous [and] much vexed.<br><a name="6">6</a>  Behold, the princes of Israel, every one were in thee to their power to shed blood.<br><a name="7">7</a>  In thee have they set light by father and mother: in the midst of thee have they dealt by oppression with the stranger: in thee have they vexed the fatherless and the widow.<br><a name="8">8</a>  Thou hast despised mine holy things, and hast profaned my sabbaths.<br><a name="9">9</a>  In thee are men that carry tales to shed blood: and in thee they eat upon the mountains: in the midst of thee they commit lewdness.<br><a name="10">10</a>  In thee have they discovered their fathers' nakedness: in thee have they humbled her that was set apart for pollution.<br><a name="11">11</a>  And one hath committed abomination with his neighbour's wife; and another hath lewdly defiled his daughter in law; and another in thee hath humbled his sister, his father's daughter.<br><a name="12">12</a>  In thee have they taken gifts to shed blood; thou hast taken usury and increase, and thou hast greedily gained of thy neighbours by extortion, and hast forgotten me, saith the Lord GOD.<br><a name="13">13</a>  Behold, therefore I have smitten mine hand at thy dishonest gain which thou hast made, and at thy blood which hath been in the midst of thee.<br><a name="14">14</a>  Can thine heart endure, or can thine hands be strong, in the days that I shall deal with thee? I the LORD have spoken [it], and will do [it].<br><a name="15">15</a>  And I will scatter thee among the heathen, and disperse thee in the countries, and will consume thy filthiness out of thee.<br><a name="16">16</a>  And thou shalt take thine inheritance in thyself in the sight of the heathen, and thou shalt know that I [am] the LORD.<br><a name="17">17</a>. And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,<br><a name="18">18</a>  Son of man, the house of Israel is to me become dross: all they [are] brass, and tin, and iron, and lead, in the midst of the furnace; they are [even] the dross of silver.<br><a name="19">19</a>  Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Because ye are all become dross, behold, therefore I will gather you into the midst of Jerusalem.<br><a name="20">20</a>  [As] they gather silver, and brass, and iron, and lead, and tin, into the midst of the furnace, to blow the fire upon it, to melt [it]; so will I gather [you] in mine anger and in my fury, and I will leave [you there], and melt you.<br><a name="21">21</a>  Yea, I will gather you, and blow upon you in the fire of my wrath, and ye shall be melted in the midst thereof.<br><a name="22">22</a>  As silver is melted in the midst of the furnace, so shall ye be melted in the midst thereof; and ye shall know that I the LORD have poured out my fury upon you.<br><a name="23">23</a>. And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,<br><a name="24">24</a>  Son of man, say unto her, Thou [art] the land that is not cleansed, nor rained upon in the day of indignation.<br><a name="25">25</a>  [There is] a conspiracy of her prophets in the midst thereof, like a roaring lion ravening the prey; they have devoured souls; they have taken the treasure and precious things; they have made her many widows in the midst thereof.<br><a name="26">26</a>  Her priests have violated my law, and have profaned mine holy things: they have put no difference between the holy and profane, neither have they shewed [difference] between the unclean and the clean, and have hid their eyes from my sabbaths, and I am profaned among them.<br><a name="27">27</a>  Her princes in the midst thereof [are] like wolves ravening the prey, to shed blood, [and] to destroy souls, to get dishonest gain.<br><a name="28">28</a>  And her prophets have daubed them with untempered [morter], seeing vanity, and divining lies unto them, saying, Thus saith the Lord GOD, when the LORD hath not spoken.<br><a name="29">29</a>  The people of the land have used oppression, and exercised robbery, and have vexed the poor and needy: yea, they have oppressed the stranger wrongfully.<br><a name="30">30</a>  And I sought for a man among them, that should make up the hedge, and stand in the gap before me for the land, that I should not destroy it: but I found none.<br><a name="31">31</a>  Therefore have I poured out mine indignation upon them; I have consumed them with the fire of my wrath: their own way have I recompensed upon their heads, saith the Lord GOD.<br><br>Go to <a href="eze23.htm#1">Ezekiel 23</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
