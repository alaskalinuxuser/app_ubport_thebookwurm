 <meta name="Description" content="The Holy Bible (KJV, English language) with interactive study notes and other resources for understanding God's Word to mankind: The Bible is rightly called 'the Book of books.' This Book tells us where we came from and where we are going. It introduces us to our Creator and reveals His character and His plans for His creation. It shows us what separates us from a right relationship with Him, and why our relationships with other people are so easily marred. This Book explains the history and foretells the future concerning the nation of Israel and the conflict that surrounds her. It points us to the One who came historically to save His people from their sins, and who will personally come again in the future to bring the salvation that He has purchased to its completion. This One is Jesus of Nazareth, the Christ (or, the Messiah), the Savior of the world, and the Lord (King) of those who belong to Him. No one can afford to ignore Him. It is no exaggeration to say that this Book tells His story from cover to cover.">
