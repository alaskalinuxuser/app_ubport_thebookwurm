<dt><b><i>49:1 And Jacob called unto his sons, and said,<br>Gather yourselves together, that I may tell you [that] which shall befall you in the last days.<br>
49:2 Gather yourselves together, and hear, ye sons of Jacob; and hearken unto Israel your father.</i></b></dt><dl>
<dt>that which shall befall you in the last days-
<dd>Jacob's words are prophetic of <i>the character of Israel and of the individual tribes</i>,<br>from the time of Jacob to their receiving of the Messiah. Some aspects of Jacob's words have been fulfilled, others await future fulfillment.<ul>
<li>The phrase '<i>the last days</i>' (or, 'the latter days'), when used in reference to Israel, speaks of the whole range of Israel's historic and prophetic experience. For example:<ol type="a">
<li>Their rebellion from God, sometime after the time of Moses. <a href="deu31.htm#28">Deu 31:28,29</a>
<li>The period of their great Tribulation, prior to their final restoration.<br><a href="deu4.htm#30">Deu 4:30</a>; <a href="eze38.htm#16">Eze 38:16</a>; cp. <a href="jer30.htm#1">Jer 30:1-24</a>
<li>The final restoration of Israel, under the Messiah. <a href="isa2.htm#2">Isa 2:2</a>; <a href="hos3.htm#5">Hos 3:5</a>; <a href="mic4.htm#1">Mic 4:1</a></ol>
<li>The term is also used in reference to the close of the 'times of the Gentiles,' at the end of the Tribulation period (<a href="dan2.htm#28">Dan 2:28</a>). In the NT, 'the last days' refers to the period between Christ's first and second comings, with special emphasis upon the growing apostasy, as the end of the Church age approaches (eg., <a href="2tim3.htm#1">2Tim 3:1</a>; <a href="2pet3.htm#3">2Pet 3:3</a>).</ul>
<dt>the sons of Jacob- are organized here into three groups: 
<dd>The Sons of Leah (v.3-15), the sons of the handmaids (v.16-21), and the sons of Rachel (v.22-27).
<dd>The sons in each group are addressed in the order of their birth (except that Leah's sixth son is addressed before the fifth).
</dl><dt>The sons of Leah-<br>
<b><i>49:3 Reuben, thou [art] my firstborn, </b></i>{<a href="gen29.htm#31">Gen 29:31,32</a>}<i><b><br>my might, and the beginning of my strength,<br>the excellency of dignity, and the excellency of power:<br>
49:4 Unstable as water, thou shalt not excel; </b></i>{cp. <a href="jam1.htm#8">Jam 1:8</a>}<i><b>
<br>because thou wentest up to thy father's bed; then defiledst thou [it]:<br>he went up to my couch.</i></b></dt><dl>
<dt>my might... my strength- Reuben, like Jacob in his early years, was self-directed.
<dd>But what the fleshly mind considered to be strength, was actually weakness.
<dt>Reuben probably thought no one knew about his adultery with Bilhah (<a href="gen35.htm#22">Gen 35:22</a>).
<dd>But Jacob knew, and now makes the matter known to all his sons.
<dd>Because of his unstable act, Reuben forfeited- <ol type="a"> 
<li>his birthright (a double portion) to Joseph. (see <a href="gen48an.htm#21" target="lwr_lt">note at Gen 48:21</a>)
<li>his right to family leadership to Judah (<a href="gen49.htm#8" target="lwr_lt">v.8</a>). cp. <a href="1chr5.htm#1">1Chr 5:1,2</a></ol>
<dt>unstable {or, licentious} as water, thou shalt not excel- cp. <a href="pro6.htm#32">Prov 6:32,33</a><ul>
<li>Reuben's descendants, characterized by instability, were often associated with unrest within the nation. eg., Their rebellion with Korah (<a href="num16.htm#1">Num 16:1-4</a>),  their choice of possession outside of Canaan (<a href="num32.htm#1">Num 32:1-5</a>), the misunderstanding about their unapproved altar (<a href="josh22.htm#11">Josh 22:11,12</a>); and their indecision regarding joining the other tribes in battle (<a href="judg5.htm#15">Judg 5:15,16</a>, read the chapter for context).
<li>They did not excel. Their decline in numbers motivated Moses to pray for their preservation.<br>cp. <a href="num1.htm#20">Num 1:20,21</a>; <a href="num26.htm#7">26:7</a>; <a href="deu33.htm#6">Deu 33:6</a></ul>
</dl><dt>
<b><i>49:5 Simeon and Levi [are] brethren </b></i>{<a href="gen29.htm#33">29:33,34</a>}<i><b>;<br>instruments of cruelty [are in] their habitations.<br>
49:6 O my soul, come not thou into their secret </b></i>{ie., secret counsel}<i><b>;<br>unto their assembly, mine honour, be not thou united:<br>for in their anger they slew a man, and in their selfwill they digged down a wall.<br>
49:7 Cursed [be] their anger, for [it was] fierce; and their wrath, for it was cruel:<br>I will divide them in Jacob, and scatter them in Israel.</i></b></dt><dl>
<dt>Simeon and Levi are brethren (ie., they were two of a kind, or, partners in crime)-
<dd>Together, they had devised the deceptive scheme and massacre at Shechem. <a href="gen34.htm#25">Gen 34:25,26</a><br>There had been nothing honorable about their action.
<dt>I will divide them... scatter them in Israel-
<dd>Neither tribe would possess their own portion in the promised land.<ul>
<li>Simeon's allotment was inside Judah's portion. <a href="josh19.htm#1">Josh 19:1-9</a>
<li>Levi received no allotment, but occupied cities scattered throughout the possessions of the other tribes. <a href="num18.htm#24">Num 18:24</a>; <a href="num35.htm#1">35:1-4</a><br>Levi's scattering, originally seen as a consequence of past fleshly actions, would become a mark of spiritual distinction, by God's grace. God honored this tribe for their zeal in defending His honor (<a href="ex32.htm#25">Ex 32:25-29</a>), by making Levi the priestly tribe. God took away their 'instruments of cruelty' and entrusted them with the ministry of His Word and of the Tabernacle. <a href="deu10.htm#8">Deu 10:8,9</a>; <a href="deu33.htm#8">33:8-11</a></ul>
</dl><dt>
<b><i>49:8 Judah </b></i>{ie., 'praise'}<i><b>, thou [art he] whom thy brethren shall praise: </b></i>{<a href="gen29.htm#35">29:35</a>}<i><b><br>thy hand [shall be] in the neck of thine enemies;<br>thy father's children shall bow down before thee.<br>
49:9 Judah [is] a lion's whelp: from the prey, my son, thou art gone up:<br>he stooped down, he couched as a lion, and as an old lion; who shall rouse him up?<br>
49:10 The sceptre shall not depart from Judah, nor a lawgiver from between his feet,<br>until Shiloh come; and unto him [shall] the gathering of the people [be].<br>
49:11 Binding his foal unto the vine, and his ass's colt unto the choice vine;<br>he washed his garments in wine, and his clothes in the blood of grapes:<br>
49:12 His eyes [shall be] red with wine, and his teeth white with milk.</i></b></dt><dl>
<dt>Prophecies concerning Judah-<ol type="A">
<li>He will lead his brothers (<a href="gen49.htm#8" target="lwr_lt">v.8 a c</a>)- <ol type="a">
<li>This was characteristic of the man,<br>- - at first, in evil (<a href="gen37.htm#26">37:26,27</a>),<br>- - later, for good (<a href="gen44.htm#13">44:13-34</a>).
<li>This was characteristic of the tribe:<br>- - First in order (eg., <a href="num10.htm#14">Num 10:14</a>; <a href="josh15.htm#1">Josh 15:1</a>),<br>- - Largest in size (see census in <a href="num1.htm#1">Num ch.1</a> and <a href="num26.htm#1">ch. 26</a>).
<li>All tribes of Israel are now called by his name: Jew.</ol>
<li>He will conquer his enemies (<a href="gen49.htm#8" target="lwr_lt">v.8b,9</a>)- This speaks of:<br>
- - King David. <a href="2sam22.htm#41">2Sam 22:41</a>; <a href="psa18.htm#40">Psa 18:40</a><br>
- - The Messiah, the Lion of the tribe of Judah. <a href="rev5.htm#5">Rev 5:5</a>
<li>He will have the right to reign as king (<a href="gen49.htm#10" target="lwr_lt">v.10</a>)-<dd>
Israel's first king was Saul of the tribe of Benjamin. God rejected him.<br>
After him came King David, of the tribe of Judah.<br>
All of Israel's legitimate kings would descend from David.<br>The phrase 'from between his feet' is an idiom meaning 'from among his children.'<br>- - Jesus Christ qualifies for the throne, being in the line of Judah through David, legally through his step-father, and physically through his mother (see genealogies in <a href="mat1.htm#1">Mat 1:1-17</a> and <a href="luk3.htm#23">Luk 3:23-38</a>; also see <a href="mat1an.htm#gen" target="lwr_lt">notes on the genealogy in Mat 1</a>).<dt>
<li>He is in the line of the Messiah (<a href="gen49.htm#10" target="lwr_lt">v.10-12</a>)- <ul>
<li>'Shiloh', the meaning has been explained in various ways:<ol type="1">
<li>'The one to whom it belongs' or 'whose it is,' referring to the Messiah's right to the throne. cp. <a href="eze21.htm#27">Eze 21:27</a>
<li>As a derivative of the HB word 'shalom' (peace).<br>This also speaks strongly of the Messiah. cp. <a href="isa9.htm#6">Isa 9:6</a>; <a href="mic5.htm#2">Mic 5:2,5</a>; <a href="psa122.htm#6">Psa 122:6</a>
<li>As referring to the town of Shiloh. This theory has no scriptural support.</ol>
<li>his foal... his ass's colt... - cp. <a href="zech9.htm#9">Zech 9:9</a>; <a href="mat21.htm#4">Mat 21:4-9</a><dd>- A sign by which to identify the coming One.<dt>
<li>...unto the vine ...unto the choice vine -<dd>
- The true identity of the One so identified. cp. <a href="mat21.htm#1">Mat 21:1-3</a>; <a href="joh15.htm#1">Joh 15:1-5</a></dd><dd>
- His personal inspection of Israel's fruit. cp. <a href="isa5.htm#1">Isa 5:1-4</a>; <a href="jer2.htm#21">Jer 2:21</a>; <a href="mat21.htm#33">Mat 21:33-42</a></dd>
<li>washed his garments in wine...- cp. <a href="luk22.htm#15">Luk 22:15-20</a>; <a href="rev1.htm#5">Rev 1:5</a>; <a href="rev7.htm#14">7:14</a>
<li>his clothes in the blood of grapes...- cp. <a href="isa63.htm#1">Isa 63:1-3</a>
<li>his eyes red with wine... his teeth white with milk-<br>This may refer to the abundance during the Messiah's reign. cp. <a href="zech3.htm#8">Zech 3:8-10</a></ul></ol>

<b><i>49:13 Zebulun </b></i>{ie., 'dwelling'}<i><b> shall dwell at the haven of the sea; </b></i>{<a href="gen30.htm#19">30:19,20</a>}<b><i><br>and he [shall be] for an haven of ships;<br>and his border [shall be] unto Zidon.</i></b></dt><dl>
<dt>Zebulun's allotment was between the Sea of Galilee and the Mediterranean Sea. <a href="deu33.htm#18">Deu 33:18,19</a>; <a href="josh19.htm#10">Josh 19:10-16</a>
<dd>Zidon (Sidon) was originally part of Asher's possession (<a href="josh19.htm#24">Josh 19:24,28</a>). Apparently, Zebulun was able to conquer territory which Asher was not able to protect from the Philistines. Zebulun's reputation in battle was better than that of Asher. cp. <a href="judg5.htm#16">Judg 5:16-18</a>; <a href="1chr12.htm#33">1Chr 12:33</a>
</dl><dt>
<b><i>49:14 Issachar [is] a strong ass couching down between two burdens: </b></i>{<a href="gen30.htm#17">30:17,18</a>}<b><i><br>
49:15 And he saw that rest [was] good, and the land that [it was] pleasant;<br>and bowed his shoulder to bear, and became a servant unto tribute.</i></b></dt><dl>
<dt>Issachar was known as a valiant tribe, both in strength and wisdom. <dd>cp. <a href="judg5.htm#15">Judg 5:15</a>; <a href="1chr7.htm#1">1Chr 7:1-5</a>; <a href="1chr12.htm#32">12:32</a><br>&nbsp;</dl>

<b><i>49:16 Dan </b></i>{ie., 'judging'}<b><i> shall judge his people, as one of the tribes of Israel. </b></i>{<a href="gen30.htm#5">30:5,6</a>}<b><i><br>
49:17 Dan shall be a serpent by the way, an adder in the path,<br>that biteth the horse heels, so that his rider shall fall backward.<br>
49:18 I have waited for thy salvation, O LORD.</i></b></dt><dl>
<dt>Dan shall be a serpent- <ul>
<li>This tribe led Israel in idol worship, and occult practises.<dd>
cp. <a href="judg18.htm#22">Judg 18:22-31</a>; <a href="1kin12.htm#28">1Kin 12:28-30</a>; <a href="2kin10.htm#29">2Kin 10:29</a></dd>
<li>Dan is absent from the list of tribes during the Tribulation period (<a href="rev7.htm#4">Rev 7:4-8</a>).<dd>Dan is mentioned in the context of opposition to God's salvation and peace. <a href="jer8.htm#15">Jer 8:15-22</a></dd><dd>Perhaps, the false prophet of the anti-christ will arise from this tribe?</dd>
<li>that biteth the horse heels... his rider shall fall backward.- cp. <a href="gen3.htm#14">Gen 3:14,15</a><dd>The satanic religious influences, introduced by Dan, would ambush the nation, causing great injury, as they fell back from following the Lord.</dd></ul>
<dt>I have waited for thy salvation {HB= yeshua}, O LORD.-
<dd>Jacob, troubled by the prophetic picture of Satanic influence through Dan, and reminded of the promised Seed who would defeat the enemy, prays for the coming of the Redeemer. This is the first occurrence of the word 'salvation' (HB= 'yeshua'). cp. <a href="isa12.htm#2">Isa 12:2,3</a>; <a href="isa49.htm#6">49:6</a>; <a href="isa62.htm#11">62:11</a>; <a href="mat1.htm#21">Mat 1:21</a> ('Jesus' in HB is 'Yeshua'); <a href="luk2.htm#29">Luk 2:29-32</a>
<dd>When He comes to reign, salvation will cover the earth. At that time, by God's grace, the tribe of Dan will have an inheritance in the kingdom of the Messiah. <a href="eze48.htm#1">Eze 48:1,2</a>
</dl><dt>- The sons of Zilpah -<dt>
<b><i>49:19 Gad </b></i>{ie., 'a troop'}<i><b>, a troop shall overcome him: but he shall overcome at the last.</i></b> {<a href="gen30.htm#10">30:10,11</a>}<dd>{or, 'Gad, a troop shall troop upon him, but he shall troop on their heels.' [NKJV]}</dt><dl>
<dt>Gad produced 'mighty men of valor'- cp. <a href="1chr5.htm#18">1Chr 5:18-20</a>; <a href="1chr12.htm#8">12:8</a>
</dl><dt>
<b><i>49:20 Out of Asher his bread [shall be] fat, and he shall yield royal dainties.</i></b> {<a href="gen30.htm#12">30:12,13</a>}</dt><dl>
<dt>Asher's blessing speaks of rich and bountiful provision. 
<dd>The word for 'fat' is closely related to the word for 'olive oil.' cp. <a href="deu8.htm#7">Deu 8:7-9</a>
</dl><dt>- Another son of Bilhah -<dt>
<b><i>49:21 Naphtali [is] a hind </b></i>{ie., a doe, a female deer}<i><b> let loose:<br>he giveth goodly words.</i></b> {<a href="gen30.htm#7">30:7,8</a>}</dt><dl>
<dt>The tribe of Naphtali distinguished themselves in battle. cp. <a href="judg5.htm#18">Judg 5:18</a>; <a href="judg4.htm#6">4:6</a>
<dt>a hind... goodly words.- The feet of the hind are swift and sure.
<dd>Jacob foresees them carrying a beautiful message. cp. <a href="rom10.htm#15">Rom 10:15</a>
<dd>Part of Jesus' ministry was in the region of Naphtali (<a href="mat4.htm#13">Mat 4:13-15</a>). Perhaps some of His disciples, who first carried His Gospel message to others, were from this tribe.
</dl><dt>The sons of Rachel -<dt>
<b><i>49:22 Joseph [is] a fruitful bough, [even] a fruitful bough by a well; </b></i>{<a href="gen30.htm#22">30:22-24</a>}<i><b><br>[whose] branches run over the wall:<br>
49:23 The archers have sorely grieved him, and shot [at him], and hated him:<br>
49:24 But his bow abode in strength,<br>and the arms of his hands were made strong by the hands of the mighty [God] of Jacob;<br>(from thence [is] the shepherd, the stone of Israel:)<br>
49:25 [Even] by the God of thy father, who shall help thee;<br>and by the Almighty, who shall bless thee with blessings of heaven above,<br>blessings of the deep that lieth under, blessings of the breasts, and of the womb:<br>
49:26 The blessings of thy father have prevailed<br>above the blessings of my progenitors unto the utmost bound of the everlasting hills:<br>they shall be on the head of Joseph,<br>and on the crown of the head of him that was separate from his brethren.</i></b></dt><dl>
<dt>Joseph is 'fruitful' (the meaning of the name 'Ephraim', Joseph's second son, <a href="gen41.htm#52">41:52</a>).
<dd>His fruitfulness was because he knew God, and trusted Him in his trials. cp. <a href="gen45.htm#5">45:5-8</a>
<dd>He was fruitful, like a tree by a well (ie., drawing from the abundant source of life). <a href="psa1.htm#1">Psa 1:1-3</a>
<dt>Jacob's words to Joseph are rich with Messianic overtones (<a href="gen49.htm#22" target="lwr_lt">v.22-26</a>):<ol type="1">
<li><i>The richness</i> of this fruitfulness is seen in-<ol type="A">
<li>its Source. Identified with five names of God-<ul>
<li>the Mighty God of Jacob. <a href="psa46.htm#7">Psa 46:7,11</a>
<li>the Shepherd (who is 'from' the Mighty God of Jacob). <a href="psa23.htm#1">Psa 23:1</a>; <a href="psa80.htm#1">80:1</a>; <a href="joh10.htm#11">Joh 10:11</a>; <a href="joh16.htm#28">16:28</a>

<li><i>The reward</i> - This fruitfulness is his reward for his faithfulness in trial.<ul>
<li>He was grieved, shot at, and hated, by various 'archers,' but strengthened by God.<br>Joseph's enemies included his brothers, the wife of Potiphar, the circumstances of slavery and imprisonment.<br>Jesus was similarly attacked and hated. cp. <a href="psa69.htm#1">Psa 69:1-4</a>; <a href="psa118.htm#13">118:13</a>; <a href="joh15.htm#25">Joh 15:25</a>
<li>He was separate from his brethren, and exalted by God. <a href="psa69.htm#8">Psa 69:8,9</a>; <a href="joh1.htm#11">Joh 1:11</a>; <a href="joh13.htm#33">13:33</a>; <a href="joh16.htm#16">16:16</a>; <a href="eph1.htm#20">Eph 1:20-23</a></ul></ol>

<dt>The tribe of Benjamin was associated with zeal to the point of cruelty. Examples - -<ul>
<li>instigation of a civil war in Israel. <a href="judg19.htm">Judg 19</a> and 20
<li>persecution of David and his supporters. King Saul was of Benjamin. <a href="1sam9.htm#1">1Sam 9:1,2</a>; <a href="1sam19.htm#10">19:10</a>; <a href="1sam22.htm#17">22:17</a>

Yet, by God's grace, Saul became the apostle Paul. His zeal toward God, once poured out in persecution, was redirected into making Christ known. <a href="gal1.htm#13">Gal 1:13-16</a>; <a href="1tim1.htm#15">1Tim 1:15,16</a></ul>
<dt>Messianic implications- cp. <a href="psa69.htm#9">Psa 69:9</a>; <a href="joh2.htm#15">Joh 2:15-17</a><ul>
<li>At His first coming, via His birth in Bethlehem, Christ came to cleanse sinners.<dd>He was both Benoni {son of sorrow, <a href="isa53.htm#3">Isa 53:3,4</a>},</dd><dd>and Benjamin {son of my right hand, <a href="heb12.htm#2">Heb 12:2</a>}.

<dt><dt>Remember that Jacob was telling his sons ''that which shall befall you in the last days'' (<a href="gen49.htm#1" target="lwr_lt">v.1</a>).-
<dd>Above, we looked at the historic and prophetic character of the individual tribes.
<dd>The <i>order</i> in which Jacob addressed the tribes may also have significance,<dd>in tracing <i>the prophetic course of Israel's history</i>,<dd>which may be divided as follows - &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[major points of this outline are from GWms]<ol type="A">
<li>The moral history of Israel up to the first advent of the Messiah-<ul>
<li><a href="gen49.htm#3" target="lwr_lt">Reuben</a>- Israel called of God, but failing in fleshly instability;<br>
in desperate need of the promised Seed. cp. <a href="deu7.htm#7">Deu 7:7,8</a>; <a href="rom9.htm#11">Rom 9:11-15</a><br>
It would be through Israel, that the world would 'see a Son.'
<li><a href="gen49.htm#5" target="lwr_lt">Simeon &amp; Levi</a>- Israel received the Law. But their response is scattered.<br>
cp. <a href="ex19.htm#8">Ex 19:8</a>; <a href="judg17.htm#6">Judg 17:6</a></ul>
