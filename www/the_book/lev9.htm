Leviticus   9<br>1. And it came to pass on the eighth day, [that] Moses called Aaron and his sons, and the elders of Israel;<br><a name="2">2</a>  And he said unto Aaron, Take thee a young calf for a sin offering, and a ram for a burnt offering, without blemish, and offer [them] before the LORD.<br><a name="3">3</a>  And unto the children of Israel thou shalt speak, saying, Take ye a kid of the goats for a sin offering; and a calf and a lamb, [both] of the first year, without blemish, for a burnt offering;<br><a name="4">4</a>  Also a bullock and a ram for peace offerings, to sacrifice before the LORD; and a meat offering mingled with oil: for to day the LORD will appear unto you.<br><a name="5">5</a>  And they brought [that] which Moses commanded before the tabernacle of the congregation: and all the congregation drew near and stood before the LORD.<br><a name="6">6</a>  And Moses said, This [is] the thing which the LORD commanded that ye should do: and the glory of the LORD shall appear unto you.<br><a name="7">7</a>  And Moses said unto Aaron, Go unto the altar, and offer thy sin offering, and thy burnt offering, and make an atonement for thyself, and for the people: and offer the offering of the people, and make an atonement for them; as the LORD commanded.<br><a name="8">8</a>. Aaron therefore went unto the altar, and slew the calf of the sin offering, which [was] for himself.<br><a name="9">9</a>  And the sons of Aaron brought the blood unto him: and he dipped his finger in the blood, and put [it] upon the horns of the altar, and poured out the blood at the bottom of the altar:<br><a name="10">10</a>  But the fat, and the kidneys, and the caul above the liver of the sin offering, he burnt upon the altar; as the LORD commanded Moses.<br><a name="11">11</a>  And the flesh and the hide he burnt with fire without the camp.<br><a name="12">12</a>  And he slew the burnt offering; and Aaron's sons presented unto him the blood, which he sprinkled round about upon the altar.<br><a name="13">13</a>  And they presented the burnt offering unto him, with the pieces thereof, and the head: and he burnt [them] upon the altar.<br><a name="14">14</a>  And he did wash the inwards and the legs, and burnt [them] upon the burnt offering on the altar.<br><a name="15">15</a>  And he brought the people's offering, and took the goat, which [was] the sin offering for the people, and slew it, and offered it for sin, as the first.<br><a name="16">16</a>  And he brought the burnt offering, and offered it according to the manner.<br><a name="17">17</a>  And he brought the meat offering, and took an handful thereof, and burnt [it] upon the altar, beside the burnt sacrifice of the morning.<br><a name="18">18</a>  He slew also the bullock and the ram [for] a sacrifice of peace offerings, which [was] for the people: and Aaron's sons presented unto him the blood, which he sprinkled upon the altar round about,<br><a name="19">19</a>  And the fat of the bullock and of the ram, the rump, and that which covereth [the inwards], and the kidneys, and the caul [above] the liver:<br><a name="20">20</a>  And they put the fat upon the breasts, and he burnt the fat upon the altar:<br><a name="21">21</a>  And the breasts and the right shoulder Aaron waved [for] a wave offering before the LORD; as Moses commanded.<br><a name="22">22</a>  And Aaron lifted up his hand toward the people, and blessed them, and came down from offering of the sin offering, and the burnt offering, and peace offerings.<br><a name="23">23</a>. And Moses and Aaron went into the tabernacle of the congregation, and came out, and blessed the people: and the glory of the LORD appeared unto all the people.<br><a name="24">24</a>  And there came a fire out from before the LORD, and consumed upon the altar the burnt offering and the fat: [which] when all the people saw, they shouted, and fell on their faces.<br><br>Go to <a href="lev10.htm#1">Leviticus 10</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
