Acts   4<br> 1. And as they spake unto the people, the priests, and the captain of the temple, and the Sadducees, came upon them,<br><a name="2">2</a>  Being grieved that they taught the people, and preached through Jesus the resurrection from the dead.<br><a name="3">3</a>  And they laid hands on them, and put [them] in hold unto the next day: for it was now eventide.<br><a name="4">4</a>  Howbeit many of them which heard the word believed; and the number of the men was about five thousand.<br><a name="5">5</a>. And it came to pass on the morrow, that their rulers, and elders, and scribes,<br><a name="6">6</a>  And Annas the high priest, and Caiaphas, and John, and Alexander, and as many as were of the kindred of the high priest, were gathered together at Jerusalem.<br><a name="7">7</a>  And when they had set them in the midst, they asked, By what power, or by what name, have ye done this?<br><a name="8">8</a>  Then Peter, filled with the Holy Ghost, said unto them, Ye rulers of the people, and elders of Israel,<br><a name="9">9</a>  If we this day be examined of the good deed done to the impotent man, by what means he is made whole;<br><a name="10">10</a>  Be it known unto you all, and to all the people of Israel, that by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom ye crucified, whom God raised from the dead, [even] by him doth this man stand here before you whole.<br><a name="11">11</a>  This is the stone which was set at nought of you builders, which is become the head of the corner.<br><a name="12">12</a>  Neither is there salvation in any other: for there is none other name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved.<br><a name="13">13</a>  Now when they saw the boldness of Peter and John, and perceived that they were unlearned and ignorant men, they marvelled; and they took knowledge of them, that they had been with Jesus.<br><a name="14">14</a>  And beholding the man which was healed standing with them, they could say nothing against it.<br><a name="15">15</a>. But when they had commanded them to go aside out of the council, they conferred among themselves,<br><a name="16">16</a>  Saying, What shall we do to these men? for that indeed a notable miracle hath been done by them [is] manifest to all them that dwell in Jerusalem; and we cannot deny [it].<br><a name="17">17</a>  But that it spread no further among the people, let us straitly threaten them, that they speak henceforth to no man in this name.<br><a name="18">18</a>  And they called them, and commanded them not to speak at all nor teach in the name of Jesus.<br><a name="19">19</a>  But Peter and John answered and said unto them, Whether it be right in the sight of God to hearken unto you more than unto God, judge ye.<br><a name="20">20</a>  For we cannot but speak the things which we have seen and heard.<br><a name="21">21</a>  So when they had further threatened them, they let them go, finding nothing how they might punish them, because of the people: for all [men] glorified God for that which was done.<br><a name="22">22</a>  For the man was above forty years old, on whom this miracle of healing was shewed.<br><a name="23">23</a>. And being let go, they went to their own company, and reported all that the chief priests and elders had said unto them.<br><a name="24">24</a>  And when they heard that, they lifted up their voice to God with one accord, and said, Lord, thou [art] God, which hast made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and all that in them is:<br><a name="25">25</a>  Who by the mouth of thy servant David hast said, Why did the heathen rage, and the people imagine vain things?<br><a name="26">26</a>  The kings of the earth stood up, and the rulers were gathered together against the Lord, and against his Christ.<br><a name="27">27</a>  For of a truth against thy holy child Jesus, whom thou hast anointed, both Herod, and Pontius Pilate, with the Gentiles, and the people of Israel, were gathered together,<br><a name="28">28</a>  For to do whatsoever thy hand and thy counsel determined before to be done.<br><a name="29">29</a>  And now, Lord, behold their threatenings: and grant unto thy servants, that with all boldness they may speak thy word,<br><a name="30">30</a>  By stretching forth thine hand to heal; and that signs and wonders may be done by the name of thy holy child Jesus.<br><a name="31">31</a>  And when they had prayed, the place was shaken where they were assembled together; and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and they spake the word of God with boldness.<br><a name="32">32</a>. And the multitude of them that believed were of one heart and of one soul: neither said any [of them] that ought of the things which he possessed was his own; but they had all things common.<br><a name="33">33</a>  And with great power gave the apostles witness of the resurrection of the Lord Jesus: and great grace was upon them all.<br><a name="34">34</a>  Neither was there any among them that lacked: for as many as were possessors of lands or houses sold them, and brought the prices of the things that were sold,<br><a name="35">35</a>  And laid [them] down at the apostles' feet: and distribution was made unto every man according as he had need.<br><a name="36">36</a>  And Joses, who by the apostles was surnamed Barnabas, (which is, being interpreted, The son of consolation,) a Levite, [and] of the country of Cyprus,<br><a name="37">37</a>  Having land, sold [it], and brought the money, and laid [it] at the apostles' feet.<br><br>Go to <a href="act5.htm#1">Acts 5</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
