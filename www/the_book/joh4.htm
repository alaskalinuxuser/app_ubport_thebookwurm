When therefore the Lord knew how the Pharisees had heard that Jesus made and baptized more disciples than John,<br><a name="2">2</a>  (Though Jesus himself baptized not, but his disciples,)<br><a name="3">3</a>  He left Judaea, and departed again into Galilee.<br><a name="4">4</a>. And he must needs go through Samaria.<br><a name="5">5</a>  Then cometh he to a city of Samaria, which is called Sychar, near to the parcel of ground that Jacob gave to his son Joseph.<br><a name="6">6</a>  Now Jacob's well was there. Jesus therefore, being wearied with [his] journey, sat thus on the well: [and] it was about the sixth hour.<br><a name="7">7</a>  There cometh a woman of Samaria to draw water: Jesus saith unto her, Give me to drink.<br><a name="8">8</a>  (For his disciples were gone away unto the city to buy meat.)<br><a name="9">9</a>  Then saith the woman of Samaria unto him, How is it that thou, being a Jew, askest drink of me, which am a woman of Samaria? for the Jews have no dealings with the Samaritans.<br><a name="10">10</a>  Jesus answered and said unto her, If thou knewest the gift of God, and who it is that saith to thee, Give me to drink; thou wouldest have asked of him, and he would have given thee living water.<br><a name="11">11</a>  The woman saith unto him, Sir, thou hast nothing to draw with, and the well is deep: from whence then hast thou that living water?<br><a name="12">12</a>  Art thou greater than our father Jacob, which gave us the well, and drank thereof himself, and his children, and his cattle?<br><a name="13">13</a>  Jesus answered and said unto her, Whosoever drinketh of this water shall thirst again:<br><a name="14">14</a>  But whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst; but the water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life.<br><a name="15">15</a>  The woman saith unto him, Sir, give me this water, that I thirst not, neither come hither to draw.<br><a name="16">16</a>  Jesus saith unto her, Go, call thy husband, and come hither.<br><a name="17">17</a>  The woman answered and said, I have no husband. Jesus said unto her, Thou hast well said, I have no husband:<br><a name="18">18</a>  For thou hast had five husbands; and he whom thou now hast is not thy husband: in that saidst thou truly.<br><a name="19">19</a>  The woman saith unto him, Sir, I perceive that thou art a prophet.<br><a name="20">20</a>  Our fathers worshipped in this mountain; and ye say, that in Jerusalem is the place where men ought to worship.<br><a name="21">21</a>  Jesus saith unto her, Woman, believe me, the hour cometh, when ye shall neither in this mountain, nor yet at Jerusalem, worship the Father.<br><a name="22">22</a>  Ye worship ye know not what: we know what we worship: for salvation is of the Jews.<br><a name="23">23</a>  But the hour cometh, and now is, when the true worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and in truth: for the Father seeketh such to worship him.<br><a name="24">24</a>  God [is] a Spirit: and they that worship him must worship [him] in spirit and in truth.<br><a name="25">25</a>  The woman saith unto him, I know that Messias cometh, which is called Christ: when he is come, he will tell us all things.<br><a name="26">26</a>  Jesus saith unto her, I that speak unto thee am [he].<br><a name="27">27</a>. And upon this came his disciples, and marvelled that he talked with the woman: yet no man said, What seekest thou? or, Why talkest thou with her?<br><a name="28">28</a>  The woman then left her waterpot, and went her way into the city, and saith to the men,<br><a name="29">29</a>  Come, see a man, which told me all things that ever I did: is not this the Christ?<br><a name="30">30</a>  Then they went out of the city, and came unto him.<br><a name="31">31</a>  In the mean while his disciples prayed him, saying, Master, eat.<br><a name="32">32</a>  But he said unto them, I have meat to eat that ye know not of.<br><a name="33">33</a>  Therefore said the disciples one to another, Hath any man brought him [ought] to eat?<br><a name="34">34</a>  Jesus saith unto them, My meat is to do the will of him that sent me, and to finish his work.<br><a name="35">35</a>  Say not ye, There are yet four months, and [then] cometh harvest? behold, I say unto you, Lift up your eyes, and look on the fields; for they are white already to harvest.<br><a name="36">36</a>  And he that reapeth receiveth wages, and gathereth fruit unto life eternal: that both he that soweth and he that reapeth may rejoice together.<br><a name="37">37</a>  And herein is that saying true, One soweth, and another reapeth.<br><a name="38">38</a>  I sent you to reap that whereon ye bestowed no labour: other men laboured, and ye are entered into their labours.<br><a name="39">39</a>  And many of the Samaritans of that city believed on him for the saying of the woman, which testified, He told me all that ever I did.<br><a name="40">40</a>  So when the Samaritans were come unto him, they besought him that he would tarry with them: and he abode there two days.<br><a name="41">41</a>  And many more believed because of his own word;<br><a name="42">42</a>  And said unto the woman, Now we believe, not because of thy saying: for we have heard [him] ourselves, and know that this is indeed the Christ, the Saviour of the world.<br><a name="43">43</a>. Now after two days he departed thence, and went into Galilee.<br><a name="44">44</a>  For Jesus himself testified, that a prophet hath no honour in his own country.<br><a name="45">45</a>  Then when he was come into Galilee, the Galilaeans received him, having seen all the things that he did at Jerusalem at the feast: for they also went unto the feast.<br><a name="46">46</a>  So Jesus came again into Cana of Galilee, where he made the water wine. And there was a certain nobleman, whose son was sick at Capernaum.<br><a name="47">47</a>  When he heard that Jesus was come out of Judaea into Galilee, he went unto him, and besought him that he would come down, and heal his son: for he was at the point of death.<br><a name="48">48</a>  Then said Jesus unto him, Except ye see signs and wonders, ye will not believe.<br><a name="49">49</a>  The nobleman saith unto him, Sir, come down ere my child die.<br><a name="50">50</a>  Jesus saith unto him, Go thy way; thy son liveth. And the man believed the word that Jesus had spoken unto him, and he went his way.<br><a name="51">51</a>  And as he was now going down, his servants met him, and told [him], saying, Thy son liveth.<br><a name="52">52</a>  Then enquired he of them the hour when he began to amend. And they said unto him, Yesterday at the seventh hour the fever left him.<br><a name="53">53</a>  So the father knew that [it was] at the same hour, in the which Jesus said unto him, Thy son liveth: and himself believed, and his whole house.<br><a name="54">54</a>  This [is] again the second miracle [that] Jesus did, when he was come out of Judaea into Galilee.<br><br>Go to <a href="joh5.htm#1">John 5</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
