Job  14<br>1. Man [that is] born of a woman [is] of few days, and full of trouble.<br><a name="2">2</a>  He cometh forth like a flower, and is cut down: he fleeth also as a shadow, and continueth not.<br><a name="3">3</a>  And dost thou open thine eyes upon such an one, and bringest me into judgment with thee?<br><a name="4">4</a>  Who can bring a clean [thing] out of an unclean? not one.<br><a name="5">5</a>  Seeing his days [are] determined, the number of his months [are] with thee, thou hast appointed his bounds that he cannot pass;<br><a name="6">6</a>  Turn from him, that he may rest, till he shall accomplish, as an hireling, his day.<br><a name="7">7</a>. For there is hope of a tree, if it be cut down, that it will sprout again, and that the tender branch thereof will not cease.<br><a name="8">8</a>  Though the root thereof wax old in the earth, and the stock thereof die in the ground;<br><a name="9">9</a>  [Yet] through the scent of water it will bud, and bring forth boughs like a plant.<br><a name="10">10</a>  But man dieth, and wasteth away: yea, man giveth up the ghost, and where [is] he?<br><a name="11">11</a>  [As] the waters fail from the sea, and the flood decayeth and drieth up:<br><a name="12">12</a>  So man lieth down, and riseth not: till the heavens [be] no more, they shall not awake, nor be raised out of their sleep.<br><a name="13">13</a>  O that thou wouldest hide me in the grave, that thou wouldest keep me secret, until thy wrath be past, that thou wouldest appoint me a set time, and remember me!<br><a name="14">14</a>  If a man die, shall he live [again]? all the days of my appointed time will I wait, till my change come.<br><a name="15">15</a>  Thou shalt call, and I will answer thee: thou wilt have a desire to the work of thine hands.<br><a name="16">16</a>. For now thou numberest my steps: dost thou not watch over my sin?<br><a name="17">17</a>  My transgression [is] sealed up in a bag, and thou sewest up mine iniquity.<br><a name="18">18</a>  And surely the mountain falling cometh to nought, and the rock is removed out of his place.<br><a name="19">19</a>  The waters wear the stones: thou washest away the things which grow [out] of the dust of the earth; and thou destroyest the hope of man.<br><a name="20">20</a>  Thou prevailest for ever against him, and he passeth: thou changest his countenance, and sendest him away.<br><a name="21">21</a>  His sons come to honour, and he knoweth [it] not; and they are brought low, but he perceiveth [it] not of them.<br><a name="22">22</a>  But his flesh upon him shall have pain, and his soul within him shall mourn.<br><br>Go to <a href="job15.htm#1">Job 15</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
