Job   7<br>1. [Is there] not an appointed time to man upon earth? [are not] his days also like the days of an hireling?<br><a name="2">2</a>  As a servant earnestly desireth the shadow, and as an hireling looketh for [the reward of] his work:<br><a name="3">3</a>  So am I made to possess months of vanity, and wearisome nights are appointed to me.<br><a name="4">4</a>  When I lie down, I say, When shall I arise, and the night be gone? and I am full of tossings to and fro unto the dawning of the day.<br><a name="5">5</a>  My flesh is clothed with worms and clods of dust; my skin is broken, and become loathsome.<br><a name="6">6</a>  My days are swifter than a weaver's shuttle, and are spent without hope.<br><a name="7">7</a>. O remember that my life [is] wind: mine eye shall no more see good.<br><a name="8">8</a>  The eye of him that hath seen me shall see me no [more]: thine eyes [are] upon me, and I [am] not.<br><a name="9">9</a>  [As] the cloud is consumed and vanisheth away: so he that goeth down to the grave shall come up no [more].<br><a name="10">10</a>  He shall return no more to his house, neither shall his place know him any more.<br><a name="11">11</a>  Therefore I will not refrain my mouth; I will speak in the anguish of my spirit; I will complain in the bitterness of my soul.<br><a name="12">12</a>  [Am] I a sea, or a whale, that thou settest a watch over me?<br><a name="13">13</a>  When I say, My bed shall comfort me, my couch shall ease my complaint;<br><a name="14">14</a>  Then thou scarest me with dreams, and terrifiest me through visions:<br><a name="15">15</a>  So that my soul chooseth strangling, [and] death rather than my life.<br><a name="16">16</a>  I loathe [it]; I would not live alway: let me alone; for my days [are] vanity.<br><a name="17">17</a>. What [is] man, that thou shouldest magnify him? and that thou shouldest set thine heart upon him?<br><a name="18">18</a>  And [that] thou shouldest visit him every morning, [and] try him every moment?<br><a name="19">19</a>  How long wilt thou not depart from me, nor let me alone till I swallow down my spittle?<br><a name="20">20</a>  I have sinned; what shall I do unto thee, O thou preserver of men? why hast thou set me as a mark against thee, so that I am a burden to myself?<br><a name="21">21</a>  And why dost thou not pardon my transgression, and take away mine iniquity? for now shall I sleep in the dust; and thou shalt seek me in the morning, but I [shall] not [be].<br><br>Go to <a href="job8.htm#1">Job 8</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
