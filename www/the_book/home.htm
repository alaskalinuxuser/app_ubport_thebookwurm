<dd>Button functions:<ul>
<li><b><a href="go_bible.htm" target="_top">Home - 3 Windows</a> or <a href="gocbible.htm" target="_top">Home - 3 Columns</a></b>- Either button will return 'The Book' to the opening page configuration. As noted in the 'Frames Help' article (see link above), there are two multi-window viewing modes. Throughout this publication, all links to 'The Book' return to the default '3 Window' mode. Use the 'Home' buttons to switch to the mode that works best on your device.

In some cases, a menu will open in the lower left window with a Table of Contents for the selected resource.
<li><a href="notemenu.htm" target="lwr_lt"><b>Book Notes</b></a>- Displays a Menu of available studies on books of the Bible (in the lower left window). When a book is selected for study, an outline of that book displays in the lower left window. Notes on a selected section will display in the upper window.

<li><a href="b-lookup.htm" target="lwr_lt"><b>Bible Text</b></a>- Displays an index of the Bible text arranged in the order the books appear in most printed Bibles.
