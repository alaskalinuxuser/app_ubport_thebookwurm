Proverbs  22<br>1. A [good] name [is] rather to be chosen than great riches, [and] loving favour rather than silver and gold.<br><a name="2">2</a>. The rich and poor meet together: the LORD [is] the maker of them all.<br><a name="3">3</a>. A prudent [man] foreseeth the evil, and hideth himself: but the simple pass on, and are punished.<br><a name="4">4</a>. By humility [and] the fear of the LORD [are] riches, and honour, and life.<br><a name="5">5</a>. Thorns [and] snares [are] in the way of the froward: he that doth keep his soul shall be far from them.<br><a name="6">6</a>. Train up a child in the way he should go: and when he is old, he will not depart from it.<br><a name="7">7</a>. The rich ruleth over the poor, and the borrower [is] servant to the lender.<br><a name="8">8</a>. He that soweth iniquity shall reap vanity: and the rod of his anger shall fail.<br><a name="9">9</a>. He that hath a bountiful eye shall be blessed; for he giveth of his bread to the poor.<br><a name="10">10</a>. Cast out the scorner, and contention shall go out; yea, strife and reproach shall cease.<br><a name="11">11</a>. He that loveth pureness of heart, [for] the grace of his lips the king [shall be] his friend.<br><a name="12">12</a>. The eyes of the LORD preserve knowledge, and he overthroweth the words of the transgressor.<br><a name="13">13</a>. The slothful [man] saith, [There is] a lion without, I shall be slain in the streets.<br><a name="14">14</a>. The mouth of strange women [is] a deep pit: he that is abhorred of the LORD shall fall therein.<br><a name="15">15</a>. Foolishness [is] bound in the heart of a child; [but] the rod of correction shall drive it far from him.<br><a name="16">16</a>. He that oppresseth the poor to increase his [riches, and] he that giveth to the rich, [shall] surely [come] to want.<br><a name="17">17</a>. Bow down thine ear, and hear the words of the wise, and apply thine heart unto my knowledge.<br><a name="18">18</a>  For [it is] a pleasant thing if thou keep them within thee; they shall withal be fitted in thy lips.<br><a name="19">19</a>  That thy trust may be in the LORD, I have made known to thee this day, even to thee.<br><a name="20">20</a>  Have not I written to thee excellent things in counsels and knowledge,<br><a name="21">21</a>  That I might make thee know the certainty of the words of truth; that thou mightest answer the words of truth to them that send unto thee?<br><a name="22">22</a>. Rob not the poor, because he [is] poor: neither oppress the afflicted in the gate:<br><a name="23">23</a>  For the LORD will plead their cause, and spoil the soul of those that spoiled them.<br><a name="24">24</a>. Make no friendship with an angry man; and with a furious man thou shalt not go:<br><a name="25">25</a>  Lest thou learn his ways, and get a snare to thy soul.<br><a name="26">26</a>. Be not thou [one] of them that strike hands, [or] of them that are sureties for debts.<br><a name="27">27</a>  If thou hast nothing to pay, why should he take away thy bed from under thee?<br><a name="28">28</a>. Remove not the ancient landmark, which thy fathers have set.<br><a name="29">29</a>. Seest thou a man diligent in his business? he shall stand before kings; he shall not stand before mean [men].<br><br>Go to <a href="pro23.htm#1">Proverbs 23</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
