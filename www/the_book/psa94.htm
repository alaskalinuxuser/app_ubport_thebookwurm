Psalms  94<br> 1. O LORD God, to whom vengeance belongeth; O God, to whom vengeance belongeth, shew thyself.<br><a name="2">2</a>  Lift up thyself, thou judge of the earth: render a reward to the proud.<br><a name="3">3</a>  LORD, how long shall the wicked, how long shall the wicked triumph?<br><a name="4">4</a>  [How long] shall they utter [and] speak hard things? [and] all the workers of iniquity boast themselves?<br><a name="5">5</a>  They break in pieces thy people, O LORD, and afflict thine heritage.<br><a name="6">6</a>  They slay the widow and the stranger, and murder the fatherless.<br><a name="7">7</a>  Yet they say, The LORD shall not see, neither shall the God of Jacob regard [it].<br><a name="8">8</a>  Understand, ye brutish among the people: and [ye] fools, when will ye be wise?<br><a name="9">9</a>  He that planted the ear, shall he not hear? he that formed the eye, shall he not see?<br><a name="10">10</a>  He that chastiseth the heathen, shall not he correct? he that teacheth man knowledge, [shall not he know]?<br><a name="11">11</a>  The LORD knoweth the thoughts of man, that they [are] vanity.<br><a name="12">12</a>. Blessed [is] the man whom thou chastenest, O LORD, and teachest him out of thy law;<br><a name="13">13</a>  That thou mayest give him rest from the days of adversity, until the pit be digged for the wicked.<br><a name="14">14</a>  For the LORD will not cast off his people, neither will he forsake his inheritance.<br><a name="15">15</a>  But judgment shall return unto righteousness: and all the upright in heart shall follow it.<br><a name="16">16</a>  Who will rise up for me against the evildoers? [or] who will stand up for me against the workers of iniquity?<br><a name="17">17</a>  Unless the LORD [had been] my help, my soul had almost dwelt in silence.<br><a name="18">18</a>  When I said, My foot slippeth; thy mercy, O LORD, held me up.<br><a name="19">19</a>  In the multitude of my thoughts within me thy comforts delight my soul.<br><a name="20">20</a>  Shall the throne of iniquity have fellowship with thee, which frameth mischief by a law?<br><a name="21">21</a>  They gather themselves together against the soul of the righteous, and condemn the innocent blood.<br><a name="22">22</a>  But the LORD is my defence; and my God [is] the rock of my refuge.<br><a name="23">23</a>  And he shall bring upon them their own iniquity, and shall cut them off in their own wickedness; [yea], the LORD our God shall cut them off.<br><br>Go to <a href="psa95.htm#1">Psalm 95</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
