And at that time were some appointed over the chambers for the treasures, for the offerings, for the firstfruits, and for the tithes, to gather into them out of the fields of the cities the portions of the law for the priests and Levites: for Judah rejoiced for the priests and for the Levites that waited.<br><a name="45">45</a>  And both the singers and the porters kept the ward of their God, and the ward of the purification, according to the commandment of David, [and] of Solomon his son.<br><a name="46">46</a>  For in the days of David and Asaph of old [there were] chief of the singers, and songs of praise and thanksgiving unto God.<br><a name="47">47</a>  And all Israel in the days of Zerubbabel, and in the days of Nehemiah, gave the portions of the singers and the porters, every day his portion: and they sanctified [holy things] unto the Levites; and the Levites sanctified [them] unto the children of Aaron.<br><br>Go to <a href="neh13.htm#1">Nehemiah 13</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
