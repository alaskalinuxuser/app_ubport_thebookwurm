1Timothy   1<br>1. Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the commandment of God our Saviour, and Lord Jesus Christ, [which is] our hope;<br><a name="2">2</a>  Unto Timothy, [my] own son in the faith: Grace, mercy, [and] peace, from God our Father and Jesus Christ our Lord.<br><a name="3">3</a>  As I besought thee to abide still at Ephesus, when I went into Macedonia, that thou mightest charge some that they teach no other doctrine,<br><a name="4">4</a>  Neither give heed to fables and endless genealogies, which minister questions, rather than godly edifying which is in faith: [so do].<br><a name="5">5</a>. Now the end of the commandment is charity out of a pure heart, and [of] a good conscience, and [of] faith unfeigned:<br><a name="6">6</a>  From which some having swerved have turned aside unto vain jangling;<br><a name="7">7</a>  Desiring to be teachers of the law; understanding neither what they say, nor whereof they affirm.<br><a name="8">8</a>  But we know that the law [is] good, if a man use it lawfully;<br><a name="9">9</a>  Knowing this, that the law is not made for a righteous man, but for the lawless and disobedient, for the ungodly and for sinners, for unholy and profane, for murderers of fathers and murderers of mothers, for manslayers,<br><a name="10">10</a>  For whoremongers, for them that defile themselves with mankind, for menstealers, for liars, for perjured persons, and if there be any other thing that is contrary to sound doctrine;<br><a name="11">11</a>  According to the glorious gospel of the blessed God, which was committed to my trust.<br><a name="12">12</a>. And I thank Christ Jesus our Lord, who hath enabled me, for that he counted me faithful, putting me into the ministry;<br><a name="13">13</a>  Who was before a blasphemer, and a persecutor, and injurious: but I obtained mercy, because I did [it] ignorantly in unbelief.<br><a name="14">14</a>  And the grace of our Lord was exceeding abundant with faith and love which is in Christ Jesus.<br><a name="15">15</a>  This [is] a faithful saying, and worthy of all acceptation, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners; of whom I am chief.<br><a name="16">16</a>  Howbeit for this cause I obtained mercy, that in me first Jesus Christ might shew forth all longsuffering, for a pattern to them which should hereafter believe on him to life everlasting.<br><a name="17">17</a>  Now unto the King eternal, immortal, invisible, the only wise God, [be] honour and glory for ever and ever. Amen.<br><a name="18">18</a>. This charge I commit unto thee, son Timothy, according to the prophecies which went before on thee, that thou by them mightest war a good warfare;<br><a name="19">19</a>  Holding faith, and a good conscience; which some having put away concerning faith have made shipwreck:<br><a name="20">20</a>  Of whom is Hymenaeus and Alexander; whom I have delivered unto Satan, that they may learn not to blaspheme.<br><br>Go to <a href="1tim2.htm#1">I Timothy 2</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
