Jeremiah  14<br>1. The word of the LORD that came to Jeremiah concerning the dearth.<br><a name="2">2</a>  Judah mourneth, and the gates thereof languish; they are black unto the ground; and the cry of Jerusalem is gone up.<br><a name="3">3</a>  And their nobles have sent their little ones to the waters: they came to the pits, [and] found no water; they returned with their vessels empty; they were ashamed and confounded, and covered their heads.<br><a name="4">4</a>  Because the ground is chapt, for there was no rain in the earth, the plowmen were ashamed, they covered their heads.<br><a name="5">5</a>  Yea, the hind also calved in the field, and forsook [it], because there was no grass.<br><a name="6">6</a>  And the wild asses did stand in the high places, they snuffed up the wind like dragons; their eyes did fail, because [there was] no grass.<br><a name="7">7</a>  O LORD, though our iniquities testify against us, do thou [it] for thy name's sake: for our backslidings are many; we have sinned against thee.<br><a name="8">8</a>  O the hope of Israel, the saviour thereof in time of trouble, why shouldest thou be as a stranger in the land, and as a wayfaring man [that] turneth aside to tarry for a night?<br><a name="9">9</a>  Why shouldest thou be as a man astonied, as a mighty man [that] cannot save? yet thou, O LORD, [art] in the midst of us, and we are called by thy name; leave us not.<br><a name="10">10</a>. Thus saith the LORD unto this people, Thus have they loved to wander, they have not refrained their feet, therefore the LORD doth not accept them; he will now remember their iniquity, and visit their sins.<br><a name="11">11</a>  Then said the LORD unto me, Pray not for this people for [their] good.<br><a name="12">12</a>  When they fast, I will not hear their cry; and when they offer burnt offering and an oblation, I will not accept them: but I will consume them by the sword, and by the famine, and by the pestilence.<br><a name="13">13</a>  Then said I, Ah, Lord GOD! behold, the prophets say unto them, Ye shall not see the sword, neither shall ye have famine; but I will give you assured peace in this place.<br><a name="14">14</a>  Then the LORD said unto me, The prophets prophesy lies in my name: I sent them not, neither have I commanded them, neither spake unto them: they prophesy unto you a false vision and divination, and a thing of nought, and the deceit of their heart.<br><a name="15">15</a>  Therefore thus saith the LORD concerning the prophets that prophesy in my name, and I sent them not, yet they say, Sword and famine shall not be in this land; By sword and famine shall those prophets be consumed.<br><a name="16">16</a>  And the people to whom they prophesy shall be cast out in the streets of Jerusalem because of the famine and the sword; and they shall have none to bury them, them, their wives, nor their sons, nor their daughters: for I will pour their wickedness upon them.<br><a name="17">17</a>. Therefore thou shalt say this word unto them; Let mine eyes run down with tears night and day, and let them not cease: for the virgin daughter of my people is broken with a great breach, with a very grievous blow.<br><a name="18">18</a>  If I go forth into the field, then behold the slain with the sword! and if I enter into the city, then behold them that are sick with famine! yea, both the prophet and the priest go about into a land that they know not.<br><a name="19">19</a>  Hast thou utterly rejected Judah? hath thy soul lothed Zion? why hast thou smitten us, and [there is] no healing for us? we looked for peace, and [there is] no good; and for the time of healing, and behold trouble!<br><a name="20">20</a>  We acknowledge, O LORD, our wickedness, [and] the iniquity of our fathers: for we have sinned against thee.<br><a name="21">21</a>  Do not abhor [us], for thy name's sake, do not disgrace the throne of thy glory: remember, break not thy covenant with us.<br><a name="22">22</a>  Are there [any] among the vanities of the Gentiles that can cause rain? or can the heavens give showers? [art] not thou he, O LORD our God? therefore we will wait upon thee: for thou hast made all these [things].<br><br>Go to <a href="jer15.htm#1">Jeremiah 15</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
