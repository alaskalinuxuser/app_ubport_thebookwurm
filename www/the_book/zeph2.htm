Zephaniah   2<br>1. Gather yourselves together, yea, gather together, O nation not desired;<br><a name="2">2</a>  Before the decree bring forth, [before] the day pass as the chaff, before the fierce anger of the LORD come upon you, before the day of the LORD'S anger come upon you.<br><a name="3">3</a>  Seek ye the LORD, all ye meek of the earth, which have wrought his judgment; seek righteousness, seek meekness: it may be ye shall be hid in the day of the LORD'S anger.<br><a name="4">4</a>. For Gaza shall be forsaken, and Ashkelon a desolation: they shall drive out Ashdod at the noon day, and Ekron shall be rooted up.<br><a name="5">5</a>  Woe unto the inhabitants of the sea coast, the nation of the Cherethites! the word of the LORD [is] against you; O Canaan, the land of the Philistines, I will even destroy thee, that there shall be no inhabitant.<br><a name="6">6</a>  And the sea coast shall be dwellings [and] cottages for shepherds, and folds for flocks.<br><a name="7">7</a>  And the coast shall be for the remnant of the house of Judah; they shall feed thereupon: in the houses of Ashkelon shall they lie down in the evening: for the LORD their God shall visit them, and turn away their captivity.<br><a name="8">8</a>. I have heard the reproach of Moab, and the revilings of the children of Ammon, whereby they have reproached my people, and magnified [themselves] against their border.<br><a name="9">9</a>  Therefore [as] I live, saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, Surely Moab shall be as Sodom, and the children of Ammon as Gomorrah, [even] the breeding of nettles, and saltpits, and a perpetual desolation: the residue of my people shall spoil them, and the remnant of my people shall possess them.<br><a name="10">10</a>  This shall they have for their pride, because they have reproached and magnified [themselves] against the people of the LORD of hosts.<br><a name="11">11</a>  The LORD [will be] terrible unto them: for he will famish all the gods of the earth; and [men] shall worship him, every one from his place, [even] all the isles of the heathen.<br><a name="12">12</a>. Ye Ethiopians also, ye [shall be] slain by my sword.<br><a name="13">13</a>  And he will stretch out his hand against the north, and destroy Assyria; and will make Nineveh a desolation, [and] dry like a wilderness.<br><a name="14">14</a>  And flocks shall lie down in the midst of her, all the beasts of the nations: both the cormorant and the bittern shall lodge in the upper lintels of it; [their] voice shall sing in the windows; desolation [shall be] in the thresholds: for he shall uncover the cedar work.<br><a name="15">15</a>  This [is] the rejoicing city that dwelt carelessly, that said in her heart, I [am], and [there is] none beside me: how is she become a desolation, a place for beasts to lie down in! every one that passeth by her shall hiss, [and] wag his hand.<br><br>Go to <a href="zeph3.htm#1">Zephaniah 3</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
