<b>Volume 3, Lesson 10</b><br>
by C.I. Scofield
<h2>True Believers and Professing Believers</h2></center>
<p>Ever since God has had a people of His own on this earth, they have been sorely troubled by the presence among them of those who professed to be of them, but were not. Beginning with Cain and Abel, this state of things will continue until &quot;The Son of Man shall send forth His angels, and they shall gather out of His kingdom all things that offend, and them which do iniquity... then shall the righteous shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their Father&quot; (<a href="mat13.htm#41">Matthew 13:41-43</a>).</p>
<b><ol type="A">

<li><a href="mat23.htm#28">Matthew 23:28-33</a> - &quot;Within ye are full of hypocrisy&quot;</ul>

<li><a href="1cor4.htm#5">1Corinthians 4:5</a> - &quot;Judge nothing before the time, until the Lord come, who will... make manifest the counsels of the hearts&quot;</ul></ol>
