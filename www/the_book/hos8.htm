Hosea   8<br>1. [Set] the trumpet to thy mouth. [He shall come] as an eagle against the house of the LORD, because they have transgressed my covenant, and trespassed against my law.<br><a name="2">2</a>  Israel shall cry unto me, My God, we know thee.<br><a name="3">3</a>  Israel hath cast off [the thing that is] good: the enemy shall pursue him.<br><a name="4">4</a>  They have set up kings, but not by me: they have made princes, and I knew [it] not: of their silver and their gold have they made them idols, that they may be cut off.<br><a name="5">5</a>  Thy calf, O Samaria, hath cast [thee] off; mine anger is kindled against them: how long [will it be] ere they attain to innocency?<br><a name="6">6</a>  For from Israel [was] it also: the workman made it; therefore it [is] not God: but the calf of Samaria shall be broken in pieces.<br><a name="7">7</a>  For they have sown the wind, and they shall reap the whirlwind: it hath no stalk: the bud shall yield no meal: if so be it yield, the strangers shall swallow it up.<br><a name="8">8</a>. Israel is swallowed up: now shall they be among the Gentiles as a vessel wherein [is] no pleasure.<br><a name="9">9</a>  For they are gone up to Assyria, a wild ass alone by himself: Ephraim hath hired lovers.<br><a name="10">10</a>  Yea, though they have hired among the nations, now will I gather them, and they shall sorrow a little for the burden of the king of princes.<br><a name="11">11</a>  Because Ephraim hath made many altars to sin, altars shall be unto him to sin.<br><a name="12">12</a>  I have written to him the great things of my law, [but] they were counted as a strange thing.<br><a name="13">13</a>  They sacrifice flesh [for] the sacrifices of mine offerings, and eat [it; but] the LORD accepteth them not; now will he remember their iniquity, and visit their sins: they shall return to Egypt.<br><a name="14">14</a>  For Israel hath forgotten his Maker, and buildeth temples; and Judah hath multiplied fenced cities: but I will send a fire upon his cities, and it shall devour the palaces thereof.<br><br>Go to <a href="hos9.htm#1">Hosea 9</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
