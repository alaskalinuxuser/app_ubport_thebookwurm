<b>Volume 1, Lesson 11</b><br>
by C.I. Scofield
<h2>The Creation, Part II</h2>
<h3><i>Genesis 1:2-27</i></h3></center>
<b><ol type="A">
<li>The earth prepared for man -- the 6 days</b><ol type="1">
<li>The first day - Light<ul>
<li><a href="gen1.htm#2">Genesis 1:2-5</a> - &quot;Let there by light&quot;</ul>
<li>The second day - Separation<ul>
<li><a href="gen1.htm#6">Genesis 1:6-8</a> - The word &quot;firmament&quot; is literally &quot;expanse.&quot; The effect of the work of the second day was the creation of atmospheric layers. God formed an expanse of land and water below, and vapor above like we see today.</ul>
<li>The third day - Plant life<ul>
<li><a href="gen1.htm#9">Genesis 1:9-13</a> - &quot;The earth brought forth grass, and herb... and tree&quot;</ul>
<li>The fourth day - The order of day and night established<ul>
<li><a href="gen1.htm#14">Genesis 1:14-19</a> - &quot;God made two great lights... to rule over the day and over the night&quot;</ul>
<li>The fifth day - Animal life<ul>
<li><a href="gen1.htm#20">Genesis 1:20-23</a> - &quot;God... created every living creature&quot;</ul>
<li>The sixth day - The creation of man; man was <i>created</i>, and did not evolve from beasts.<ul>
<li><a href="gen1.htm#24">Genesis 1:24-31</a> gives the general statement, while <a href="gen2.htm#7">Genesis 2:7,21-25</a> gives the detailed statement.
<li><a href="gen1.htm#26">Genesis 1:26</a> - &quot;Us,&quot; &quot;Our.&quot; These words show a distinct affirmation of the plurality of the Divine Being. Afterward this was revealed as the Trinity - Father, Son and Holy Spirit (<a href="mat28.htm#19">Matthew 28:19</a>).
<li><a href="gen1.htm#26">Genesis 1:26</a> - &quot;Let us make man in our image.&quot; An affirmation of the unity of the Godhead -- three Persons, one God. Like his Maker, man is a tri-unity: spirit, soul and body (<a href="1the5.htm#23">1Thessalonians 5:23</a>). Through his spirit man may know God; through his soul, himself; through his bodily senses, the world about him.
<li><a href="gen2.htm#7">Genesis 2:7</a> - &quot;God formed man of the dust of the ground&quot;</ul>
<li>The seventh day - Rest<ul>
<li><a href="gen2.htm#1">Genesis 2:1-3</a> - &quot;He rested on the seventh day.&quot; Seven is the number of completeness. The work of creation was finished, and was perfect. There was nothing to add, or to change, so God rested. This is a type of God's rest in Christ's perfect work of redemption (<a href="heb4.htm#1">Hebrews 4:1-11</a>).</ul></ol></ol>
