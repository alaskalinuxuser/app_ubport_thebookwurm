Psalms   7<br> 1. Shiggaion of David, which he sang unto the LORD, concerning the words of Cush the Benjamite. O LORD my God, in thee do I put my trust: save me from all them that persecute me, and deliver me:<br><a name="2">2</a>  Lest he tear my soul like a lion, rending [it] in pieces, while [there is] none to deliver.<br><a name="3">3</a>  O LORD my God, if I have done this; if there be iniquity in my hands;<br><a name="4">4</a>  If I have rewarded evil unto him that was at peace with me; (yea, I have delivered him that without cause is mine enemy:)<br><a name="5">5</a>  Let the enemy persecute my soul, and take [it]; yea, let him tread down my life upon the earth, and lay mine honour in the dust. Selah.<br><a name="6">6</a>  Arise, O LORD, in thine anger, lift up thyself because of the rage of mine enemies: and awake for me [to] the judgment [that] thou hast commanded.<br><a name="7">7</a>  So shall the congregation of the people compass thee about: for their sakes therefore return thou on high.<br><a name="8">8</a>  The LORD shall judge the people: judge me, O LORD, according to my righteousness, and according to mine integrity [that is] in me.<br><a name="9"></a> 9  Oh let the wickedness of the wicked come to an end; but establish the just: for the righteous God trieth the hearts and reins.<br><a name="10">10</a>. My defence [is] of God, which saveth the upright in heart.<br><a name="11">11</a>  God judgeth the righteous, and God is angry [with the wicked] every day.<br><a name="12">12</a>  If he turn not, he will whet his sword; he hath bent his bow, and made it ready.<br><a name="13">13</a>  He hath also prepared for him the instruments of death; he ordaineth his arrows against the persecutors.<br><a name="14">14</a>  Behold, he travaileth with iniquity, and hath conceived mischief, and brought forth falsehood.<br><a name="15">15</a>  He made a pit, and digged it, and is fallen into the ditch [which] he made.<br><a name="16">16</a>  His mischief shall return upon his own head, and his violent dealing shall come down upon his own pate.<br><a name="17">17</a>  I will praise the LORD according to his righteousness: and will sing praise to the name of the LORD most high.<br><br>Go to <a href="psa8.htm#1">Psalm 8</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
