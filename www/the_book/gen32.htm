Genesis  32<br> 1. And Jacob went on his way, and the angels of God met him.<br><a name="2">2</a>  And when Jacob saw them, he said, This [is] God's host: and he called the name of that place Mahanaim.<br><a name="3">3</a>. And Jacob sent messengers before him to Esau his brother unto the land of Seir, the country of Edom.<br><a name="4">4</a>  And he commanded them, saying, Thus shall ye speak unto my lord Esau; Thy servant Jacob saith thus, I have sojourned with Laban, and stayed there until now:<br><a name="5">5</a>  And I have oxen, and asses, flocks, and menservants, and womenservants: and I have sent to tell my lord, that I may find grace in thy sight.<br><a name="6">6</a>  And the messengers returned to Jacob, saying, We came to thy brother Esau, and also he cometh to meet thee, and four hundred men with him.<br><a name="7">7</a>  Then Jacob was greatly afraid and distressed: and he divided the people that [was] with him, and the flocks, and herds, and the camels, into two bands;<br><a name="8">8</a>  And said, If Esau come to the one company, and smite it, then the other company which is left shall escape.<br><a name="9">9</a>. And Jacob said, O God of my father Abraham, and God of my father Isaac, the LORD which saidst unto me, Return unto thy country, and to thy kindred, and I will deal well with thee:<br><a name="10">10</a>  I am not worthy of the least of all the mercies, and of all the truth, which thou hast shewed unto thy servant; for with my staff I passed over this Jordan; and now I am become two bands.<br><a name="11">11</a>  Deliver me, I pray thee, from the hand of my brother, from the hand of Esau: for I fear him, lest he will come and smite me, [and] the mother with the children.<br><a name="12">12</a>  And thou saidst, I will surely do thee good, and make thy seed as the sand of the sea, which cannot be numbered for multitude.<br><a name="13">13</a>. And he lodged there that same night; and took of that which came to his hand a present for Esau his brother;<br><a name="14">14</a>  Two hundred she goats, and twenty he goats, two hundred ewes, and twenty rams,<br><a name="15">15</a>  Thirty milch camels with their colts, forty kine, and ten bulls, twenty she asses, and ten foals.<br><a name="16">16</a>  And he delivered [them] into the hand of his servants, every drove by themselves; and said unto his servants, Pass over before me, and put a space betwixt drove and drove.<br><a name="17">17</a>  And he commanded the foremost, saying, When Esau my brother meeteth thee, and asketh thee, saying, Whose [art] thou? and whither goest thou? and whose [are] these before thee?<br><a name="18">18</a>  Then thou shalt say, [They be] thy servant Jacob's; it [is] a present sent unto my lord Esau: and, behold, also he [is] behind us.<br><a name="19">19</a>  And so commanded he the second, and the third, and all that followed the droves, saying, On this manner shall ye speak unto Esau, when ye find him.<br><a name="20">20</a>  And say ye moreover, Behold, thy servant Jacob [is] behind us. For he said, I will appease him with the present that goeth before me, and afterward I will see his face; peradventure he will accept of me.<br><a name="21">21</a>  So went the present over before him: and himself lodged that night in the company.<br><a name="22">22</a>  And he rose up that night, and took his two wives, and his two womenservants, and his eleven sons, and passed over the ford Jabbok.<br><a name="23">23</a>  And he took them, and sent them over the brook, and sent over that he had.<br><a name="24">24</a>. And Jacob was left alone; and there wrestled a man with him until the breaking of the day.<br><a name="25">25</a>  And when he saw that he prevailed not against him, he touched the hollow of his thigh; and the hollow of Jacob's thigh was out of joint, as he wrestled with him.<br><a name="26">26</a>  And he said, Let me go, for the day breaketh. And he said, I will not let thee go, except thou bless me.<br><a name="27">27</a>  And he said unto him, What [is] thy name? And he said, Jacob.<br><a name="28">28</a>  And he said, Thy name shall be called no more Jacob, but Israel: for as a prince hast thou power with God and with men, and hast prevailed.<br><a name="29">29</a>  And Jacob asked [him], and said, Tell [me], I pray thee, thy name. And he said, Wherefore [is] it [that] thou dost ask after my name? And he blessed him there.<br><a name="30">30</a>  And Jacob called the name of the place Peniel: for I have seen God face to face, and my life is preserved.<br><a name="31">31</a>  And as he passed over Penuel the sun rose upon him, and he halted upon his thigh.<br><a name="32">32</a>  Therefore the children of Israel eat not [of] the sinew which shrank, which [is] upon the hollow of the thigh, unto this day: because he touched the hollow of Jacob's thigh in the sinew that shrank.<br><br>Go to <a href="gen33.htm#1">Genesis 33</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
