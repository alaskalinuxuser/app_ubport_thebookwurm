Psalms  86<br> 1. A Prayer of David. Bow down thine ear, O LORD, hear me: for I [am] poor and needy.<br><a name="2">2</a>  Preserve my soul; for I [am] holy: O thou my God, save thy servant that trusteth in thee.<br><a name="3">3</a>  Be merciful unto me, O Lord: for I cry unto thee daily.<br><a name="4">4</a>  Rejoice the soul of thy servant: for unto thee, O Lord, do I lift up my soul.<br><a name="5">5</a>  For thou, Lord, [art] good, and ready to forgive; and plenteous in mercy unto all them that call upon thee.<br><a name="6">6</a>  Give ear, O LORD, unto my prayer; and attend to the voice of my supplications.<br><a name="7">7</a>  In the day of my trouble I will call upon thee: for thou wilt answer me.<br><a name="8">8</a>. Among the gods [there is] none like unto thee, O Lord; neither [are there any works] like unto thy works.<br><a name="9">9</a>  All nations whom thou hast made shall come and worship before thee, O Lord; and shall glorify thy name.<br><a name="10">10</a>  For thou [art] great, and doest wondrous things: thou [art] God alone.<br><a name="11">11</a>  Teach me thy way, O LORD; I will walk in thy truth: unite my heart to fear thy name.<br><a name="12">12</a>  I will praise thee, O Lord my God, with all my heart: and I will glorify thy name for evermore.<br><a name="13">13</a>  For great [is] thy mercy toward me: and thou hast delivered my soul from the lowest hell.<br><a name="14">14</a>  O God, the proud are risen against me, and the assemblies of violent [men] have sought after my soul; and have not set thee before them.<br><a name="15">15</a>  But thou, O Lord, [art] a God full of compassion, and gracious, longsuffering, and plenteous in mercy and truth.<br><a name="16">16</a>  O turn unto me, and have mercy upon me; give thy strength unto thy servant, and save the son of thine handmaid.<br><a name="17">17</a>  Shew me a token for good; that they which hate me may see [it], and be ashamed: because thou, LORD, hast holpen me, and comforted me.<br><br>Go to <a href="psa87.htm#1">Psalm 87</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
