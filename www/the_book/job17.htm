Job  17<br>1. My breath is corrupt, my days are extinct, the graves [are ready] for me.<br><a name="2">2</a>  [Are there] not mockers with me? and doth not mine eye continue in their provocation?<br><a name="3">3</a>  Lay down now, put me in a surety with thee; who [is] he [that] will strike hands with me?<br><a name="4">4</a>  For thou hast hid their heart from understanding: therefore shalt thou not exalt [them].<br><a name="5">5</a>  He that speaketh flattery to [his] friends, even the eyes of his children shall fail.<br><a name="6">6</a>  He hath made me also a byword of the people; and aforetime I was as a tabret.<br><a name="7">7</a>  Mine eye also is dim by reason of sorrow, and all my members [are] as a shadow.<br><a name="8">8</a>  Upright [men] shall be astonied at this, and the innocent shall stir up himself against the hypocrite.<br><a name="9">9</a>  The righteous also shall hold on his way, and he that hath clean hands shall be stronger and stronger.<br><a name="10">10</a>.
