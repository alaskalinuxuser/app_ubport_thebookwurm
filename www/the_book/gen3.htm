And he said unto the woman, Yea, hath God said, Ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden?<br><a name="2">2</a>  And the woman said unto the serpent, We may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden:<br><a name="3">3</a>  But of the fruit of the tree which [is] in the midst of the garden, God hath said, Ye shall not eat of it, neither shall ye touch it, lest ye die.<br><a name="4"></a> 4  And the serpent said unto the woman, Ye shall not surely die:<br><a name="5">5</a>  For God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be as gods, knowing good and evil.<br><a name="6"></a> 6. And when the woman saw that the tree [was] good for food, and that it [was] pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be desired to make [one] wise, she took of the fruit thereof, and did eat, and gave also unto her husband with her; and he did eat.<br><a name="7">7</a>  And the eyes of them both were opened, and they knew that they [were] naked; and they sewed fig leaves together, and made themselves aprons.<br><a name="8"></a> 8  And they heard the voice of the LORD God walking in the garden in the cool of the day: and Adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the LORD God amongst the trees of the garden.<br><a name="9">9</a>. And the LORD God called unto Adam, and said unto him, Where [art] thou?<br><a name="10">10</a>  And he said, I heard thy voice in the garden, and I was afraid, because I [was] naked; and I hid myself.<br><a name="11">11</a>. And he said, Who told thee that thou [wast] naked? Hast thou eaten of the tree, whereof I commanded thee that thou shouldest not eat?<br><a name="12">12</a>  And the man said, The woman whom thou gavest [to be] with me, she gave me of the tree, and I did eat.<br><a name="13">13</a>  And the LORD God said unto the woman, What [is] this [that] thou hast done? And the woman said, The serpent beguiled me, and I did eat.<br><a name="14">14</a>. And the LORD God said unto the serpent, Because thou hast done this, thou [art] cursed above all cattle, and above every beast of the field; upon thy belly shalt thou go, and dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life:<br><a name="15">15</a>  And I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel.<br><a name="16">16</a>. Unto the woman he said, I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception; in sorrow thou shalt bring forth children; and thy desire [shall be] to thy husband, and he shall rule over thee.<br><a name="17">17</a>. And unto Adam he said, Because thou hast hearkened unto the voice of thy wife, and hast eaten of the tree, of which I commanded thee, saying, Thou shalt not eat of it: cursed [is] the ground for thy sake; in sorrow shalt thou eat [of] it all the days of thy life;<br><a name="18">18</a>  Thorns also and thistles shall it bring forth to thee; and thou shalt eat the herb of the field;<br><a name="19">19</a>  In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread, till thou return unto the ground; for out of it wast thou taken: for dust thou [art], and unto dust shalt thou return.<br><a name="20">20</a>. And Adam called his wife's name Eve; because she was the mother of all living.<br><a name="21">21</a>. Unto Adam also and to his wife did the LORD God make coats of skins, and clothed them.<br><a name="22"></a> 22. And the LORD God said, Behold, the man is become as one of us, to know good and evil: and now, lest he put forth his hand, and take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live for ever:<br><a name="23">23</a>  Therefore the LORD God sent him forth from the garden of Eden, to till the ground from whence he was taken.<br><a name="24"></a> 24  So he drove out the man; and he placed at the east of the garden of Eden Cherubims, and a flaming sword which turned every way, to keep the way of the tree of life.<br><br>Go to <a href="gen4.htm#1">Genesis 4</a></body><html>
