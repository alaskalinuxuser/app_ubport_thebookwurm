<b>Volume 4, Lesson 2</b><br>
by C.I. Scofield
<h2>The First Civilization Judged</h2>
<h3><i>Genesis 6 and 7</i></h3></center>
<b><ol type="A">
<li>The two seeds</b><ol type="1">
<li>The family of Cain chose worldly, rather than spiritual, benefits
<p>The first civilization, that which perished in the judgment of the flood, descended through the line of Cain. Every element of the grandest material civilization is mentioned in <a href="gen4.htm#16">Genesis 4:16-22</a> -- city and pastoral life (vs.17-20), the development of the arts (v.21), and the beginning of manufacturing in brass and iron (v.22). Enoch means &quot;teacher,&quot; implying systems of learning. Adah means &quot;pleasure&quot; and Lamech, &quot;conqueror.&quot;</p>
<li>The family of Seth, worshippers of Jehovah<ul>
<li><a href="gen4.htm#25">Genesis 4:25,26</a> - &quot;She bare a son... Seth... began men to call upon the name of the Lord&quot;
<li><a href="gen5.htm#21">Genesis 5:21-24</a> - &quot;Enoch walked with God... God took him&quot; (see <a href="heb11.htm#5">Hebrews 11:5</a>)
<li><a href="gen6.htm#9">Genesis 6:9</a> - &quot;Noah... perfect in his generations... walked with God&quot;</ul></ol><b>
<li>The falling away of the descendants of Seth</b><ul>
<li><a href="gen6.htm#1">Genesis 6:1,2</a> - &quot;Sons of God saw the daughters of men... took them wives of all which they chose&quot;<br>So long as the descendants of Seth maintained a clear and separate walk and kept a pure testimony, the divine unity was preserved. [But, apparently, the godly line mingled with the ungodly line of men.]</ul><b>
<li>The apparent result of the failure</b><ul>
<li><a href="gen6.htm#4">Genesis 6:4</a> - &quot;Giants... mighty men... men of renown&quot;<br>
Note that some Bible commentaries equate the &quot;sons of God&quot; (from Genesis 6:2) with angelic beings who &quot;kept not their first estate, but left their own habitation&quot; (<a href="jude1.htm#6">Jude 6</a>).</ul><b>
<li>The real result of the failure of both seeds</b><ul>
<li><a href="gen6.htm#5">Genesis 6:5</a> - &quot;God saw... wickedness... only evil continually&quot;
<li><a href="gen6.htm#7">Genesis 6:7</a> - &quot;I will destroy man&quot;
<li><a href="gen6.htm#11">Genesis 6:11-13</a> - &quot;Corrupt... violence... end of all flesh is come&quot;
<p>God is not impressed by earth's civilizations. He has seen too many of them rise and fall. The civilization we currently live in was exposed, and its end foretold from the very beginning. It is the world (<a href="joh7.htm#7">John 7:7</a>; <a href="joh8.htm#23">8:23</a>; <a href="joh12.htm#25">12:25-31</a>; <a href="joh14.htm#30">14:30</a>; <a href="joh15.htm#18">15:18,19</a>) of which Satan is a &quot;prince&quot; (<a href="joh14.htm#30">John 14:30</a>), and &quot;god&quot; (<a href="2cor4.htm#4">2Corinthians 4:4</a>). The world's principles are force, greed, ambition, covetousness, and pleasure, and because of these, it is appointed to judgment (<a href="act17.htm#31">Acts 17:31</a>).</p></ul><b>
<li>Salvation through grace</b><ul>
<li><a href="gen6.htm#8">Genesis 6:8</a> - &quot;Noah found grace&quot;
<li><a href="gen6.htm#14">Genesis 6:14</a> - &quot;An ark.&quot; A type of Christ, as the refuge of His people from judgment (see <a href="heb11.htm#7">Hebrews 11:7</a>).
<li><a href="gen7.htm#16">Genesis 7:16</a> - &quot;They went in... the Lord shut him in&quot;<br>
The Lord preserved those who still chose to worship Him.</ul><b>
<li>A new covenant</b><ol type="1">
<li>A covenant of grace through sacrifice<ul>
<li><a href="gen8.htm#20">Genesis 8:20-22</a> - &quot;An altar... I will not again curse&quot;</ul>
<li>Human government established<ul>
<li><a href="gen9.htm#1">Genesis 9:1-17</a> - &quot;Be fruitful, and multiply... whoso sheddeth man's blood, by man shall his blood be shed&quot;</ul></ol></ol>
