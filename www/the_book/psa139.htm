Psalms 139<br> 1. To the chief Musician, A Psalm of David. O LORD, thou hast searched me, and known [me].<br><a name="2">2</a>  Thou knowest my downsitting and mine uprising, thou understandest my thought afar off.<br><a name="3">3</a>  Thou compassest my path and my lying down, and art acquainted [with] all my ways.<br><a name="4">4</a>  For [there is] not a word in my tongue, [but], lo, O LORD, thou knowest it altogether.<br><a name="5">5</a>  Thou hast beset me behind and before, and laid thine hand upon me.<br><a name="6">6</a>  [Such] knowledge [is] too wonderful for me; it is high, I cannot [attain] unto it.<br><a name="7">7</a>. Whither shall I go from thy spirit? or whither shall I flee from thy presence?<br><a name="8">8</a>  If I ascend up into heaven, thou [art] there: if I make my bed in hell, behold, thou [art there].<br><a name="9">9</a>  [If] I take the wings of the morning, [and] dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea;<br><a name="10">10</a>  Even there shall thy hand lead me, and thy right hand shall hold me.<br><a name="11">11</a>  If I say, Surely the darkness shall cover me; even the night shall be light about me.<br><a name="12">12</a>  Yea, the darkness hideth not from thee; but the night shineth as the day: the darkness and the light [are] both alike [to thee].<br><a name="13">13</a>  For thou hast possessed my reins: thou hast covered me in my mother's womb.<br><a name="14">14</a>  I will praise thee; for I am fearfully [and] wonderfully made: marvellous [are] thy works; and [that] my soul knoweth right well.<br><a name="15">15</a>  My substance was not hid from thee, when I was made in secret, [and] curiously wrought in the lowest parts of the earth.<br><a name="16">16</a>  Thine eyes did see my substance, yet being unperfect; and in thy book all [my members] were written, [which] in continuance were fashioned, when [as yet there was] none of them.<br><a name="17">17</a>. How precious also are thy thoughts unto me, O God! how great is the sum of them!<br><a name="18">18</a>  [If] I should count them, they are more in number than the sand: when I awake, I am still with thee.<br><a name="19">19</a>  Surely thou wilt slay the wicked, O God: depart from me therefore, ye bloody men.<br><a name="20">20</a>  For they speak against thee wickedly, [and] thine enemies take [thy name] in vain.<br><a name="21">21</a>  Do not I hate them, O LORD, that hate thee? and am not I grieved with those that rise up against thee?<br><a name="22">22</a>  I hate them with perfect hatred: I count them mine enemies.<br><a name="23">23</a>  Search me, O God, and know my heart: try me, and know my thoughts:<br><a name="24">24</a>  And see if [there be any] wicked way in me, and lead me in the way everlasting.<br><br>Go to <a href="psa140.htm#1">Psalm 140</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
