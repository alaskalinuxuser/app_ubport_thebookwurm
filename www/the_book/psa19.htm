Psalms  19<br> 1. To the chief Musician, A Psalm of David. The heavens declare the glory of God; and the firmament sheweth his handywork.<br><a name="2">2</a>  Day unto day uttereth speech, and night unto night sheweth knowledge.<br><a name="3">3</a>  [There is] no speech nor language, [where] their voice is not heard.<br><a name="4">4</a>  Their line is gone out through all the earth, and their words to the end of the world. In them hath he set a tabernacle for the sun,<br><a name="5">5</a>  Which [is] as a bridegroom coming out of his chamber, [and] rejoiceth as a strong man to run a race.<br><a name="6">6</a>  His going forth [is] from the end of the heaven, and his circuit unto the ends of it: and there is nothing hid from the heat thereof.<br><a name="7">7</a>. The law of the LORD [is] perfect, converting the soul: the testimony of the LORD [is] sure, making wise the simple.<br><a name="8">8</a>  The statutes of the LORD [are] right, rejoicing the heart: the commandment of the LORD [is] pure, enlightening the eyes.<br><a name="9">9</a>  The fear of the LORD [is] clean, enduring for ever: the judgments of the LORD [are] true [and] righteous altogether.<br><a name="10">10</a>  More to be desired [are they] than gold, yea, than much fine gold: sweeter also than honey and the honeycomb.<br><a name="11">11</a>  Moreover by them is thy servant warned: [and] in keeping of them [there is] great reward.<br><a name="12">12</a>  Who can understand [his] errors? cleanse thou me from secret [faults].<br><a name="13">13</a>  Keep back thy servant also from presumptuous [sins]; let them not have dominion over me: then shall I be upright, and I shall be innocent from the great transgression.<br><a name="14">14</a>  Let the words of my mouth, and the meditation of my heart, be acceptable in thy sight, O LORD, my strength, and my redeemer.<br><br>Go to <a href="psa20.htm#1">Psalm 20</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
