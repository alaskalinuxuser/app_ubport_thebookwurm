Ezekiel  11<br>1. Moreover the spirit lifted me up, and brought me unto the east gate of the LORD'S house, which looketh eastward: and behold at the door of the gate five and twenty men; among whom I saw Jaazaniah the son of Azur, and Pelatiah the son of Benaiah, princes of the people.<br><a name="2">2</a>  Then said he unto me, Son of man, these [are] the men that devise mischief, and give wicked counsel in this city:<br><a name="3">3</a>  Which say, [It is] not near; let us build houses: this [city is] the caldron, and we [be] the flesh.<br><a name="4">4</a>  Therefore prophesy against them, prophesy, O son of man.<br><a name="5">5</a>  And the Spirit of the LORD fell upon me, and said unto me, Speak; Thus saith the LORD; Thus have ye said, O house of Israel: for I know the things that come into your mind, [every one of] them.<br><a name="6">6</a>  Ye have multiplied your slain in this city, and ye have filled the streets thereof with the slain.<br><a name="7">7</a>  Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Your slain whom ye have laid in the midst of it, they [are] the flesh, and this [city is] the caldron: but I will bring you forth out of the midst of it.<br><a name="8">8</a>  Ye have feared the sword; and I will bring a sword upon you, saith the Lord GOD.<br><a name="9">9</a>  And I will bring you out of the midst thereof, and deliver you into the hands of strangers, and will execute judgments among you.<br><a name="10">10</a>  Ye shall fall by the sword; I will judge you in the border of Israel; and ye shall know that I [am] the LORD.<br><a name="11">11</a>  This [city] shall not be your caldron, neither shall ye be the flesh in the midst thereof; [but] I will judge you in the border of Israel:<br><a name="12">12</a>  And ye shall know that I [am] the LORD: for ye have not walked in my statutes, neither executed my judgments, but have done after the manners of the heathen that [are] round about you.<br><a name="13">13</a>  And it came to pass, when I prophesied, that Pelatiah the son of Benaiah died. Then fell I down upon my face, and cried with a loud voice, and said, Ah Lord GOD! wilt thou make a full end of the remnant of Israel?<br><a name="14">14</a>. Again the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,<br><a name="15">15</a>  Son of man, thy brethren, [even] thy brethren, the men of thy kindred, and all the house of Israel wholly, [are] they unto whom the inhabitants of Jerusalem have said, Get you far from the LORD: unto us is this land given in possession.<br><a name="16">16</a>  Therefore say, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Although I have cast them far off among the heathen, and although I have scattered them among the countries, yet will I be to them as a little sanctuary in the countries where they shall come.<br><a name="17">17</a>  Therefore say, Thus saith the Lord GOD; I will even gather you from the people, and assemble you out of the countries where ye have been scattered, and I will give you the land of Israel.<br><a name="18">18</a>  And they shall come thither, and they shall take away all the detestable things thereof and all the abominations thereof from thence.<br><a name="19">19</a>  And I will give them one heart, and I will put a new spirit within you; and I will take the stony heart out of their flesh, and will give them an heart of flesh:<br><a name="20">20</a>  That they may walk in my statutes, and keep mine ordinances, and do them: and they shall be my people, and I will be their God.<br><a name="21">21</a>  But [as for them] whose heart walketh after the heart of their detestable things and their abominations, I will recompense their way upon their own heads, saith the Lord GOD.<br><a name="22">22</a>. Then did the cherubims lift up their wings, and the wheels beside them; and the glory of the God of Israel [was] over them above.<br><a name="23">23</a>  And the glory of the LORD went up from the midst of the city, and stood upon the mountain which [is] on the east side of the city.<br><a name="24">24</a>  Afterwards the spirit took me up, and brought me in a vision by the Spirit of God into Chaldea, to them of the captivity. So the vision that I had seen went up from me.<br><a name="25">25</a>  Then I spake unto them of the captivity all the things that the LORD had shewed me.<br><br>Go to <a href="eze12.htm#1">Ezekiel 12</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
