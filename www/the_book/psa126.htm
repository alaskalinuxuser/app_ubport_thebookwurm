Psalms 126<br>1. A Song of degrees. When the LORD turned again the captivity of Zion, we were like them that dream.<br><a name="2">2</a>  Then was our mouth filled with laughter, and our tongue with singing: then said they among the heathen, The LORD hath done great things for them.<br><a name="3">3</a>  The LORD hath done great things for us; [whereof] we are glad.<br><a name="4">4</a>. Turn again our captivity, O LORD, as the streams in the south.<br><a name="5">5</a>  They that sow in tears shall reap in joy.<br><a name="6">6</a>  He that goeth forth and weepeth, bearing precious seed, shall doubtless come again with rejoicing, bringing his sheaves [with him].<br><br>Go to <a href="psa127.htm#1">Psalm 127</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
