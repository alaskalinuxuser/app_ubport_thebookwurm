Jeremiah  49<br>1. Concerning the Ammonites, thus saith the LORD; Hath Israel no sons? hath he no heir? why [then] doth their king inherit Gad, and his people dwell in his cities?<br><a name="2">2</a>  Therefore, behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will cause an alarm of war to be heard in Rabbah of the Ammonites; and it shall be a desolate heap, and her daughters shall be burned with fire: then shall Israel be heir unto them that were his heirs, saith the LORD.<br><a name="3">3</a>  Howl, O Heshbon, for Ai is spoiled: cry, ye daughters of Rabbah, gird you with sackcloth; lament, and run to and fro by the hedges; for their king shall go into captivity, [and] his priests and his princes together.<br><a name="4">4</a>  Wherefore gloriest thou in the valleys, thy flowing valley, O backsliding daughter? that trusted in her treasures, [saying], Who shall come unto me?<br><a name="5">5</a>  Behold, I will bring a fear upon thee, saith the Lord GOD of hosts, from all those that be about thee; and ye shall be driven out every man right forth; and none shall gather up him that wandereth.<br><a name="6">6</a>  And afterward I will bring again the captivity of the children of Ammon, saith the LORD.<br><a name="7">7</a>. Concerning Edom, thus saith the LORD of hosts; [Is] wisdom no more in Teman? is counsel perished from the prudent? is their wisdom vanished?<br><a name="8">8</a>  Flee ye, turn back, dwell deep, O inhabitants of Dedan; for I will bring the calamity of Esau upon him, the time [that] I will visit him.<br><a name="9">9</a>  If grapegatherers come to thee, would they not leave [some] gleaning grapes? if thieves by night, they will destroy till they have enough.<br><a name="10">10</a>  But I have made Esau bare, I have uncovered his secret places, and he shall not be able to hide himself: his seed is spoiled, and his brethren, and his neighbours, and he [is] not.<br><a name="11">11</a>  Leave thy fatherless children, I will preserve [them] alive; and let thy widows trust in me.<br><a name="12">12</a>  For thus saith the LORD; Behold, they whose judgment [was] not to drink of the cup have assuredly drunken; and [art] thou he [that] shall altogether go unpunished? thou shalt not go unpunished, but thou shalt surely drink [of it].<br><a name="13">13</a>  For I have sworn by myself, saith the LORD, that Bozrah shall become a desolation, a reproach, a waste, and a curse; and all the cities thereof shall be perpetual wastes.<br><a name="14">14</a>  I have heard a rumour from the LORD, and an ambassador is sent unto the heathen, [saying], Gather ye together, and come against her, and rise up to the battle.<br><a name="15">15</a>  For, lo, I will make thee small among the heathen, [and] despised among men.<br><a name="16">16</a>  Thy terribleness hath deceived thee, [and] the pride of thine heart, O thou that dwellest in the clefts of the rock, that holdest the height of the hill: though thou shouldest make thy nest as high as the eagle, I will bring thee down from thence, saith the LORD.<br><a name="17">17</a>  Also Edom shall be a desolation: every one that goeth by it shall be astonished, and shall hiss at all the plagues thereof.<br><a name="18">18</a>  As in the overthrow of Sodom and Gomorrah and the neighbour [cities] thereof, saith the LORD, no man shall abide there, neither shall a son of man dwell in it.<br><a name="19">19</a>  Behold, he shall come up like a lion from the swelling of Jordan against the habitation of the strong: but I will suddenly make him run away from her: and who [is] a chosen [man, that] I may appoint over her? for who [is] like me? and who will appoint me the time? and who [is] that shepherd that will stand before me?<br><a name="20">20</a>  Therefore hear the counsel of the LORD, that he hath taken against Edom; and his purposes, that he hath purposed against the inhabitants of Teman: Surely the least of the flock shall draw them out: surely he shall make their habitations desolate with them.<br><a name="21">21</a>  The earth is moved at the noise of their fall, at the cry the noise thereof was heard in the Red sea.<br><a name="22">22</a>  Behold, he shall come up and fly as the eagle, and spread his wings over Bozrah: and at that day shall the heart of the mighty men of Edom be as the heart of a woman in her pangs.<br><a name="23">23</a>. Concerning Damascus. Hamath is confounded, and Arpad: for they have heard evil tidings: they are fainthearted; [there is] sorrow on the sea; it cannot be quiet.<br><a name="24">24</a>  Damascus is waxed feeble, [and] turneth herself to flee, and fear hath seized on [her]: anguish and sorrows have taken her, as a woman in travail.<br><a name="25">25</a>  How is the city of praise not left, the city of my joy!<br><a name="26">26</a>  Therefore her young men shall fall in her streets, and all the men of war shall be cut off in that day, saith the LORD of hosts.<br><a name="27">27</a>  And I will kindle a fire in the wall of Damascus, and it shall consume the palaces of Benhadad.<br><a name="28">28</a>. Concerning Kedar, and concerning the kingdoms of Hazor, which Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon shall smite, thus saith the LORD; Arise ye, go up to Kedar, and spoil the men of the east.<br><a name="29">29</a>  Their tents and their flocks shall they take away: they shall take to themselves their curtains, and all their vessels, and their camels; and they shall cry unto them, Fear [is] on every side.<br><a name="30">30</a>  Flee, get you far off, dwell deep, O ye inhabitants of Hazor, saith the LORD; for Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon hath taken counsel against you, and hath conceived a purpose against you.<br><a name="31">31</a>  Arise, get you up unto the wealthy nation, that dwelleth without care, saith the LORD, which have neither gates nor bars, [which] dwell alone.<br><a name="32">32</a>  And their camels shall be a booty, and the multitude of their cattle a spoil: and I will scatter into all winds them [that are] in the utmost corners; and I will bring their calamity from all sides thereof, saith the LORD.<br><a name="33">33</a>  And Hazor shall be a dwelling for dragons, [and] a desolation for ever: there shall no man abide there, nor [any] son of man dwell in it.<br><a name="34">34</a>. The word of the LORD that came to Jeremiah the prophet against Elam in the beginning of the reign of Zedekiah king of Judah, saying,<br><a name="35">35</a>  Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Behold, I will break the bow of Elam, the chief of their might.<br><a name="36">36</a>  And upon Elam will I bring the four winds from the four quarters of heaven, and will scatter them toward all those winds; and there shall be no nation whither the outcasts of Elam shall not come.<br><a name="37">37</a>  For I will cause Elam to be dismayed before their enemies, and before them that seek their life: and I will bring evil upon them, [even] my fierce anger, saith the LORD; and I will send the sword after them, till I have consumed them:<br><a name="38">38</a>  And I will set my throne in Elam, and will destroy from thence the king and the princes, saith the LORD.<br><a name="39">39</a>  But it shall come to pass in the latter days, [that] I will bring again the captivity of Elam, saith the LORD.<br><br>Go to <a href="jer50.htm#1">Jeremiah 50</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
