Proverbs   4<br>1. Hear, ye children, the instruction of a father, and attend to know understanding.<br><a name="2">2</a>  For I give you good doctrine, forsake ye not my law.<br><a name="3">3</a>  For I was my father's son, tender and only [beloved] in the sight of my mother.<br><a name="4">4</a>  He taught me also, and said unto me, Let thine heart retain my words: keep my commandments, and live.<br><a name="5">5</a>  Get wisdom, get understanding: forget [it] not; neither decline from the words of my mouth.<br><a name="6">6</a>  Forsake her not, and she shall preserve thee: love her, and she shall keep thee.<br><a name="7">7</a>  Wisdom [is] the principal thing; [therefore] get wisdom: and with all thy getting get understanding.<br><a name="8">8</a>  Exalt her, and she shall promote thee: she shall bring thee to honour, when thou dost embrace her.<br><a name="9">9</a>  She shall give to thine head an ornament of grace: a crown of glory shall she deliver to thee.<br><a name="10">10</a>  Hear, O my son, and receive my sayings; and the years of thy life shall be many.<br><a name="11">11</a>  I have taught thee in the way of wisdom; I have led thee in right paths.<br><a name="12">12</a>  When thou goest, thy steps shall not be straitened; and when thou runnest, thou shalt not stumble.<br><a name="13">13</a>  Take fast hold of instruction; let [her] not go: keep her; for she [is] thy life.<br><a name="14">14</a>. Enter not into the path of the wicked, and go not in the way of evil [men].<br><a name="15">15</a>  Avoid it, pass not by it, turn from it, and pass away.<br><a name="16">16</a>  For they sleep not, except they have done mischief; and their sleep is taken away, unless they cause [some] to fall.<br><a name="17">17</a>  For they eat the bread of wickedness, and drink the wine of violence.<br><a name="18">18</a>  But the path of the just [is] as the shining light, that shineth more and more unto the perfect day.<br><a name="19">19</a>  The way of the wicked [is] as darkness: they know not at what they stumble.<br><a name="20">20</a>. My son, attend to my words; incline thine ear unto my sayings.<br><a name="21">21</a>  Let them not depart from thine eyes; keep them in the midst of thine heart.<br><a name="22">22</a>  For they [are] life unto those that find them, and health to all their flesh.<br><a name="23">23</a>  Keep thy heart with all diligence; for out of it [are] the issues of life.<br><a name="24">24</a>  Put away from thee a froward mouth, and perverse lips put far from thee.<br><a name="25">25</a>  Let thine eyes look right on, and let thine eyelids look straight before thee.<br><a name="26">26</a>  Ponder the path of thy feet, and let all thy ways be established.<br><a name="27">27</a>  Turn not to the right hand nor to the left: remove thy foot from evil.<br><br>Go to <a href="pro5.htm#1">Proverbs 5</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
