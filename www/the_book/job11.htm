Job  11<br>1. Then answered Zophar the Naamathite, and said,<br><a name="2">2</a>  Should not the multitude of words be answered? and should a man full of talk be justified?<br><a name="3">3</a>  Should thy lies make men hold their peace? and when thou mockest, shall no man make thee ashamed?<br><a name="4">4</a>  For thou hast said, My doctrine [is] pure, and I am clean in thine eyes.<br><a name="5">5</a>  But oh that God would speak, and open his lips against thee;<br><a name="6">6</a>  And that he would shew thee the secrets of wisdom, that [they are] double to that which is! Know therefore that God exacteth of thee [less] than thine iniquity [deserveth].<br><a name="7">7</a>. Canst thou by searching find out God? canst thou find out the Almighty unto perfection?<br><a name="8">8</a>  [It is] as high as heaven; what canst thou do? deeper than hell; what canst thou know?<br><a name="9">9</a>  The measure thereof [is] longer than the earth, and broader than the sea.<br><a name="10">10</a>  If he cut off, and shut up, or gather together, then who can hinder him?<br><a name="11">11</a>  For he knoweth vain men: he seeth wickedness also; will he not then consider [it]?<br><a name="12">12</a>  For vain man would be wise, though man be born [like] a wild ass's colt.<br><a name="13">13</a>. If thou prepare thine heart, and stretch out thine hands toward him;<br><a name="14">14</a>  If iniquity [be] in thine hand, put it far away, and let not wickedness dwell in thy tabernacles.<br><a name="15">15</a>  For then shalt thou lift up thy face without spot; yea, thou shalt be stedfast, and shalt not fear:<br><a name="16">16</a>  Because thou shalt forget [thy] misery, [and] remember [it] as waters [that] pass away:<br><a name="17">17</a>  And [thine] age shall be clearer than the noonday; thou shalt shine forth, thou shalt be as the morning.<br><a name="18">18</a>  And thou shalt be secure, because there is hope; yea, thou shalt dig [about thee, and] thou shalt take thy rest in safety.<br><a name="19">19</a>  Also thou shalt lie down, and none shall make [thee] afraid; yea, many shall make suit unto thee.<br><a name="20">20</a>  But the eyes of the wicked shall fail, and they shall not escape, and their hope [shall be as] the giving up of the ghost.<br><br>Go to <a href="job12.htm#1">Job 12</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
