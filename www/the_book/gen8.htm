Genesis   8<br>1. And God remembered Noah, and every living thing, and all the cattle that [was] with him in the ark: and God made a wind to pass over the earth, and the waters asswaged;<br><a name="2">2</a>  The fountains also of the deep and the windows of heaven were stopped, and the rain from heaven was restrained;<br><a name="3">3</a>  And the waters returned from off the earth continually: and after the end of the hundred and fifty days the waters were abated.<br><a name="4">4</a>. And the ark rested in the seventh month, on the seventeenth day of the month, upon the mountains of Ararat.<br><a name="5">5</a>  And the waters decreased continually until the tenth month: in the tenth [month], on the first [day] of the month, were the tops of the mountains seen.<br><a name="6">6</a>. And it came to pass at the end of forty days, that Noah opened the window of the ark which he had made:<br><a name="7">7</a>  And he sent forth a raven, which went forth to and fro, until the waters were dried up from off the earth.<br><a name="8">8</a>  Also he sent forth a dove from him, to see if the waters were abated from off the face of the ground;<br><a name="9">9</a>  But the dove found no rest for the sole of her foot, and she returned unto him into the ark, for the waters [were] on the face of the whole earth: then he put forth his hand, and took her, and pulled her in unto him into the ark.<br><a name="10">10</a>  And he stayed yet other seven days; and again he sent forth the dove out of the ark;<br><a name="11">11</a>  And the dove came in to him in the evening; and, lo, in her mouth [was] an olive leaf pluckt off: so Noah knew that the waters were abated from off the earth.<br><a name="12">12</a>  And he stayed yet other seven days; and sent forth the dove; which returned not again unto him any more.<br><a name="13">13</a>. And it came to pass in the six hundredth and first year, in the first [month], the first [day] of the month, the waters were dried up from off the earth: and Noah removed the covering of the ark, and looked, and, behold, the face of the ground was dry.<br><a name="14">14</a>  And in the second month, on the seven and twentieth day of the month, was the earth dried.<br><a name="15">15</a>. And God spake unto Noah, saying,<br><a name="16">16</a>  Go forth of the ark, thou, and thy wife, and thy sons, and thy sons' wives with thee.<br><a name="17">17</a>  Bring forth with thee every living thing that [is] with thee, of all flesh, [both] of fowl, and of cattle, and of every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth; that they may breed abundantly in the earth, and be fruitful, and multiply upon the earth.<br><a name="18">18</a>  And Noah went forth, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons' wives with him:<br><a name="19">19</a>  Every beast, every creeping thing, and every fowl, [and] whatsoever creepeth upon the earth, after their kinds, went forth out of the ark.<br><a name="20">20</a>. And Noah builded an altar unto the LORD; and took of every clean beast, and of every clean fowl, and offered burnt offerings on the altar.<br><a name="21">21</a>  And the LORD smelled a sweet savour; and the LORD said in his heart, I will not again curse the ground any more for man's sake; for the imagination of man's heart [is] evil from his youth; neither will I again smite any more every thing living, as I have done.<br><a name="22">22</a>  While the earth remaineth, seedtime and harvest, and cold and heat, and summer and winter, and day and night shall not cease.<br><br>Go to <a href="gen9.htm#1">Genesis 9</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
