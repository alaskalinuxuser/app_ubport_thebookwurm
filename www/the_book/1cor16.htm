1Corinthians  16<br>1. Now concerning the collection for the saints, as I have given order to the churches of Galatia, even so do ye.<br><a name="2">2</a>  Upon the first [day] of the week let every one of you lay by him in store, as [God] hath prospered him, that there be no gatherings when I come.<br><a name="3">3</a>  And when I come, whomsoever ye shall approve by [your] letters, them will I send to bring your liberality unto Jerusalem.<br><a name="4">4</a>  And if it be meet that I go also, they shall go with me.<br><a name="5">5</a>. Now I will come unto you, when I shall pass through Macedonia: for I do pass through Macedonia.<br><a name="6">6</a>  And it may be that I will abide, yea, and winter with you, that ye may bring me on my journey whithersoever I go.<br><a name="7">7</a>  For I will not see you now by the way; but I trust to tarry a while with you, if the Lord permit.<br><a name="8">8</a>  But I will tarry at Ephesus until Pentecost.<br><a name="9">9</a>  For a great door and effectual is opened unto me, and [there are] many adversaries.<br><a name="10">10</a>. Now if Timotheus come, see that he may be with you without fear: for he worketh the work of the Lord, as I also [do].<br><a name="11">11</a>  Let no man therefore despise him: but conduct him forth in peace, that he may come unto me: for I look for him with the brethren.<br><a name="12">12</a>  As touching [our] brother Apollos, I greatly desired him to come unto you with the brethren: but his will was not at all to come at this time; but he will come when he shall have convenient time.<br><a name="13">13</a>. Watch ye, stand fast in the faith, quit you like men, be strong.<br><a name="14">14</a>  Let all your things be done with charity.<br><a name="15">15</a>  I beseech you, brethren, (ye know the house of Stephanas, that it is the firstfruits of Achaia, and [that] they have addicted themselves to the ministry of the saints,)<br><a name="16">16</a>  That ye submit yourselves unto such, and to every one that helpeth with [us], and laboureth.<br><a name="17">17</a>  I am glad of the coming of Stephanas and Fortunatus and Achaicus: for that which was lacking on your part they have supplied.<br><a name="18">18</a>  For they have refreshed my spirit and yours: therefore acknowledge ye them that are such.<br><a name="19">19</a>. The churches of Asia salute you. Aquila and Priscilla salute you much in the Lord, with the church that is in their house.<br><a name="20">20</a>  All the brethren greet you. Greet ye one another with an holy kiss.<br><a name="21">21</a>  The salutation of [me] Paul with mine own hand.<br><a name="22">22</a>  If any man love not the Lord Jesus Christ, let him be Anathema Maranatha.<br><a name="23">23</a>  The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ [be] with you.<br><a name="24">24</a>  My love [be] with you all in Christ Jesus.
