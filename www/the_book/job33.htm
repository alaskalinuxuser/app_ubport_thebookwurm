Job  33<br>1. Wherefore, Job, I pray thee, hear my speeches, and hearken to all my words.<br><a name="2">2</a>  Behold, now I have opened my mouth, my tongue hath spoken in my mouth.<br><a name="3">3</a>  My words [shall be of] the uprightness of my heart: and my lips shall utter knowledge clearly.<br><a name="4">4</a>  The Spirit of God hath made me, and the breath of the Almighty hath given me life.<br><a name="5">5</a>  If thou canst answer me, set [thy words] in order before me, stand up.<br><a name="6">6</a>  Behold, I [am] according to thy wish in God's stead: I also am formed out of the clay.<br><a name="7">7</a>  Behold, my terror shall not make thee afraid, neither shall my hand be heavy upon thee.<br><a name="8">8</a>. Surely thou hast spoken in mine hearing, and I have heard the voice of [thy] words, [saying],<br><a name="9">9</a>  I am clean without transgression, I [am] innocent; neither [is there] iniquity in me.<br><a name="10">10</a>  Behold, he findeth occasions against me, he counteth me for his enemy,<br><a name="11">11</a>  He putteth my feet in the stocks, he marketh all my paths.<br><a name="12">12</a>  Behold, [in] this thou art not just: I will answer thee, that God is greater than man.<br><a name="13">13</a>  Why dost thou strive against him? for he giveth not account of any of his matters.<br><a name="14">14</a>. For God speaketh once, yea twice, [yet man] perceiveth it not.<br><a name="15">15</a>  In a dream, in a vision of the night, when deep sleep falleth upon men, in slumberings upon the bed;<br><a name="16">16</a>  Then he openeth the ears of men, and sealeth their instruction,<br><a name="17">17</a>  That he may withdraw man [from his] purpose, and hide pride from man.<br><a name="18">18</a>  He keepeth back his soul from the pit, and his life from perishing by the sword.<br><a name="19">19</a>. He is chastened also with pain upon his bed, and the multitude of his bones with strong [pain]:<br><a name="20">20</a>  So that his life abhorreth bread, and his soul dainty meat.<br><a name="21">21</a>  His flesh is consumed away, that it cannot be seen; and his bones [that] were not seen stick out.<br><a name="22">22</a>  Yea, his soul draweth near unto the grave, and his life to the destroyers.<br><a name="23">23</a>  If there be a messenger with him, an interpreter, one among a thousand, to shew unto man his uprightness:<br><a name="24">24</a>  Then he is gracious unto him, and saith, Deliver him from going down to the pit: I have found a ransom.<br><a name="25">25</a>  His flesh shall be fresher than a child's: he shall return to the days of his youth:<br><a name="26">26</a>  He shall pray unto God, and he will be favourable unto him: and he shall see his face with joy: for he will render unto man his righteousness.<br><a name="27">27</a>  He looketh upon men, and [if any] say, I have sinned, and perverted [that which was] right, and it profited me not;<br><a name="28">28</a>  He will deliver his soul from going into the pit, and his life shall see the light.<br><a name="29">29</a>. Lo, all these [things] worketh God oftentimes with man,<br><a name="30">30</a>  To bring back his soul from the pit, to be enlightened with the light of the living.<br><a name="31">31</a>  Mark well, O Job, hearken unto me: hold thy peace, and I will speak.<br><a name="32">32</a>  If thou hast any thing to say, answer me: speak, for I desire to justify thee.<br><a name="33">33</a>  If not, hearken unto me: hold thy peace, and I shall teach thee wisdom.<br><br>Go to <a href="job34.htm#1">Job 34</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
