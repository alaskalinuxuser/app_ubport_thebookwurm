2Corinthians   2<br> 1. But I determined this with myself, that I would not come again to you in heaviness.<br><a name="2">2</a>  For if I make you sorry, who is he then that maketh me glad, but the same which is made sorry by me?<br><a name="3">3</a>  And I wrote this same unto you, lest, when I came, I should have sorrow from them of whom I ought to rejoice; having confidence in you all, that my joy is [the joy] of you all.<br><a name="4">4</a>  For out of much affliction and anguish of heart I wrote unto you with many tears; not that ye should be grieved, but that ye might know the love which I have more abundantly unto you.<br><a name="5">5</a>. But if any have caused grief, he hath not grieved me, but in part: that I may not overcharge you all.<br><a name="6">6</a>  Sufficient to such a man [is] this punishment, which [was inflicted] of many.<br><a name="7">7</a>  So that contrariwise ye [ought] rather to forgive [him], and comfort [him], lest perhaps such a one should be swallowed up with overmuch sorrow.<br><a name="8">8</a>  Wherefore I beseech you that ye would confirm [your] love toward him.<br><a name="9">9</a>  For to this end also did I write, that I might know the proof of you, whether ye be obedient in all things.<br><a name="10">10</a>  To whom ye forgive any thing, I [forgive] also: for if I forgave any thing, to whom I forgave [it], for your sakes [forgave I it] in the person of Christ;<br><a name="11">11</a>  Lest Satan should get an advantage of us: for we are not ignorant of his devices.<br><a name="12">12</a>. Furthermore, when I came to Troas to [preach] Christ's gospel, and a door was opened unto me of the Lord,<br><a name="13">13</a>  I had no rest in my spirit, because I found not Titus my brother: but taking my leave of them, I went from thence into Macedonia.<br><a name="14">14</a>  Now thanks [be] unto God, which always causeth us to triumph in Christ, and maketh manifest the savour of his knowledge by us in every place.<br><a name="15">15</a>  For we are unto God a sweet savour of Christ, in them that are saved, and in them that perish:<br><a name="16">16</a>  To the one [we are] the savour of death unto death; and to the other the savour of life unto life. And who [is] sufficient for these things?<br><a name="17">17</a>  For we are not as many, which corrupt the word of God: but as of sincerity, but as of God, in the sight of God speak we in Christ.<br><br>Go to <a href="2cor3.htm#1">II Corinthians 3</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
