Deuteronomy  24<br>1. When a man hath taken a wife, and married her, and it come to pass that she find no favour in his eyes, because he hath found some uncleanness in her: then let him write her a bill of divorcement, and give [it] in her hand, and send her out of his house.<br><a name="2">2</a>  And when she is departed out of his house, she may go and be another man's [wife].<br><a name="3">3</a>  And [if] the latter husband hate her, and write her a bill of divorcement, and giveth [it] in her hand, and sendeth her out of his house; or if the latter husband die, which took her [to be] his wife;<br><a name="4">4</a>  Her former husband, which sent her away, may not take her again to be his wife, after that she is defiled; for that [is] abomination before the LORD: and thou shalt not cause the land to sin, which the LORD thy God giveth thee [for] an inheritance.<br><a name="5">5</a>. When a man hath taken a new wife, he shall not go out to war, neither shall he be charged with any business: [but] he shall be free at home one year, and shall cheer up his wife which he hath taken.<br><a name="6">6</a>  No man shall take the nether or the upper millstone to pledge: for he taketh [a man's] life to pledge.<br><a name="7">7</a>  If a man be found stealing any of his brethren of the children of Israel, and maketh merchandise of him, or selleth him; then that thief shall die; and thou shalt put evil away from among you.<br><a name="8">8</a>  Take heed in the plague of leprosy, that thou observe diligently, and do according to all that the priests the Levites shall teach you: as I commanded them, [so] ye shall observe to do.<br><a name="9">9</a>  Remember what the LORD thy God did unto Miriam by the way, after that ye were come forth out of Egypt.<br><a name="10">10</a>  When thou dost lend thy brother any thing, thou shalt not go into his house to fetch his pledge.<br><a name="11">11</a>  Thou shalt stand abroad, and the man to whom thou dost lend shall bring out the pledge abroad unto thee.<br><a name="12">12</a>  And if the man [be] poor, thou shalt not sleep with his pledge:<br><a name="13">13</a>  In any case thou shalt deliver him the pledge again when the sun goeth down, that he may sleep in his own raiment, and bless thee: and it shall be righteousness unto thee before the LORD thy God.<br><a name="14">14</a>. Thou shalt not oppress an hired servant [that is] poor and needy, [whether he be] of thy brethren, or of thy strangers that [are] in thy land within thy gates:<br><a name="15">15</a>  At his day thou shalt give [him] his hire, neither shall the sun go down upon it; for he [is] poor, and setteth his heart upon it: lest he cry against thee unto the LORD, and it be sin unto thee.<br><a name="16">16</a>  The fathers shall not be put to death for the children, neither shall the children be put to death for the fathers: every man shall be put to death for his own sin.<br><a name="17">17</a>  Thou shalt not pervert the judgment of the stranger, [nor] of the fatherless; nor take a widow's raiment to pledge:<br><a name="18">18</a>  But thou shalt remember that thou wast a bondman in Egypt, and the LORD thy God redeemed thee thence: therefore I command thee to do this thing.<br><a name="19">19</a>  When thou cuttest down thine harvest in thy field, and hast forgot a sheaf in the field, thou shalt not go again to fetch it: it shall be for the stranger, for the fatherless, and for the widow: that the LORD thy God may bless thee in all the work of thine hands.<br><a name="20">20</a>  When thou beatest thine olive tree, thou shalt not go over the boughs again: it shall be for the stranger, for the fatherless, and for the widow.<br><a name="21">21</a>  When thou gatherest the grapes of thy vineyard, thou shalt not glean [it] afterward: it shall be for the stranger, for the fatherless, and for the widow.<br><a name="22">22</a>  And thou shalt remember that thou wast a bondman in the land of Egypt: therefore I command thee to do this thing.<br><br>Go to <a href="deu25.htm#1">Deuteronomy 25</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
