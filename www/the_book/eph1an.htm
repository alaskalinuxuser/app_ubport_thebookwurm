<b><a href="eph1.htm#1" target="lwr_lt">Ephesians 1:1-23</a></b> - <a href="eph_menu.htm" target="lwr_lt">Outline of Ephesians (Menu page)</a><br>
<dl><dt>The letter to the Ephesians is one of the four &quot;prison epistles,&quot; which Paul wrote while in prison in Rome. These include: Ephesians, Philippians, Colossians and Philemon. The first three epistles present a thorough picture of God's design for the NT church. The fourth is a personal letter to Philemon, which provides a wonderful illustration of reconciliation which rests upon imputed righteousness.
<p>The three church epistles each have a specific emphasis:<ul>
<li>Ephesians - The Church of Christ: The Fullness of His Body (<a href="eph1.htm#22">Eph 1:22,23</a>)
<li>Philippians - The Church of Christ: The Fullness of Joy in Selfless Fellowship (<a href="php2.htm#1">Php 2:1-3</a>; <a href="php3.htm#9">3:9-11</a>) 
<li>Colossians - The Church of Christ: The Fullness of its Head (<a href="col2.htm#9">Col 2:9,10</a>)</ul></p>
<p>All of these letters were apparently sent out at about the same time (c.64 AD). The letter to the Philippians was carried by Epaphroditus (<a href="php2.htm#25">Php 2:25</a>; <a href="php4.htm#18">4:18</a>). The other three letters were carried by Tychicus, who was accompanied by other brothers, including Onesimus, who is the subject of the letter to Philemon (<a href="eph6.htm#21">Eph 6:21</a>; <a href="col4.htm#7">Col 4:7-9</a>; <a href="phm1.htm#10">Phm 1:10</a>).</p>
<dt><b><i>1. Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God,<br>
to the saints which are at Ephesus, and to the faithful in Christ Jesus:<br>
2 Grace [be] to you, and peace,<br>from God our Father, and [from] the Lord Jesus Christ.</b></i></dt><dl>
<dt>Paul introduces himself, as a messenger sent by Jesus Christ,<dd>and commissioned by the will of God. He did not take this office to himself, but was obedient to the call of God.
<dt>He writes &quot;to the saints,&quot; ie., those who are set apart unto God<dd>
through faith in Christ Jesus. The word 'faithful' can also be translated 'believing.'
<dt>...in Christ Jesus.- This is the key phrase in Ephesians.
<dd>Through faith in Christ, believers are identified with Him, and placed in Him. All of the blessings which we have, including Grace (ie., unmerited favor) and Peace (ie., both the Peace of God and the Peace with God), come to us from God, because we are in Christ. This is the theme of this letter, as can be readily seen as the text continues. (Note the underlined words.)</dl>
<b><i>3. Blessed [be] the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,<br>who hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly [places] <u>in Christ</u>:<br>
4 According as he hath chosen us <u>in him</u> before the foundation of the world,<br>that we should be holy and without blame before him in love:</b></i></dt><dl>
<dt>Even before the foundation of the world, God had determined to give His beloved Son, for you and me.
<dd>'Before the foundation {GK=katabole, throwing down, depositing of seed} of the world {GK=kosmos, arrangement, order}' may refer to 'prior to the creation' or 'prior to the establishment of the world system.' God knew, before hand, that the world of men would be corrupted by sin. Therefore, in great mercy, He established His plan of salvation, prior to man's fall.
<dt>...chosen in Him... that we should be holy and without blame before Him...<dd>Those who are 'in Christ' have been redeemed out of this sinful world, and from our own sinfulness. If you are among the redeemed, your name is &quot;written in the Book of Life of the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world&quot; (<a href="rev13.htm#8">Rev 13:8</a>). Jesus was set apart as &quot;the Lamb of God who taketh away the sins of the world&quot; (<a href="joh1.htm#29">Joh 1:29</a>). God's purpose in sending Him was &quot;that we should be holy and without blame before Him in love&quot; (<a href="eph1.htm#4" target="lwr_lt">Eph 1:4</a>). It is only through Christ's sacrifice, that sinners can be transformed into &quot;saints.&quot; For when He takes away your sin, your guilt is displaced by His righteousness and you are set apart as a child of the heavenly Father, to serve Him.</dl>
<dt><b><i>5 Having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself,<br>according to the good pleasure of his will,<br>
6 To the praise of the glory of his grace,<br>wherein he hath made us accepted <u>in the beloved</u>.</b></i></dt><dl>
<dt>He hath chosen {elected} us (<a href="eph1.htm#4" target="lwr_lt">v.4</a>)... having predestinated us (<a href="eph1.htm#5" target="lwr_lt">v.5</a>)...- 
<dt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the difference between election and predestination?<ul>
<li><b>Election - relates to becoming a child of God.</b>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In v. 4, we saw that God chose or elected those who would become His children, long before they recognized their need for the Savior. Yet, the offer of salvation and sonship is to &quot;whosoever believeth in Him&quot (<a href="joh3.htm#15">Joh 3:15,16</a>), and &quot;to as many as received Him, to them gave He power to become the sons of God, even to them that believed on His name&quot; (<a href="joh1.htm#12">Joh 1:12,13</a>).<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The apparent conflict, between God's sovereign choice and man's free will, has caused great debates among theologians. However, according to the scriptures, both are true. The 'saved' are those who willingly believe in Christ, in response to the Gospel message, which is freely proclaimed to all. (<a href="act16.htm#31">Acts 16:31</a>; <a href="rom10.htm#8">Rom 10:8-13</a>). Yet, those who believe are &quot;elect {ie., chosen} according to the foreknowledge of God&quot; (<a href="1pet1.htm#2">1Pet 1:2</a>). One aspect of God's foreknowledge is that He knows the end from the beginning. Therefore, He has always known who would receive Christ as Savior, even before they made that decision. But that explanation of foreknowledge is not completely satisfactory, because that which God foreknows will certainly come to pass (cp. <a href="act2.htm#23">Acts 2:23</a>). Thus, we read that only those whom the Father gives to the Son, will come to Him (<a href="joh6.htm#37">Joh 6:37,44</a>), and even the ability to believe is a gift from God (<a href="eph2.htm#8">Eph 2:8,9</a>). 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No man can claim that he has been excluded, because the Lord Jesus Christ personally extends an invitation to everyone (<a href="mat11.htm#28">Mat 11:28</a>; <a href="joh7.htm#37">Joh 7:37</a>; <a href="rev22.htm#17">Rev 22:17</a>). Neither can any man boast in being included among the chosen, for all are condemned in sin, and all who believe are saved, apart from any merit of their own (<a href="rom3.htm#20">Rom 3:20-27</a>).
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 'elect' are those who trust in Christ. Those who trust in Christ are the elect. Which ever way you prefer to state it, such believers have become children of God, through being born again of God's Spirit, through faith in God's Beloved Son. God's children are 'sealed' as His purchased possessions, by the Holy Spirit. Note that this sealing occurs <i>after</i> they believe (<a href="eph1.htm#13">Eph 1:13,14</a>). Yet, God's children possess eternal life (which by definition, has no beginning or end)... eternal life which is 'in Christ' (<a href="1joh5.htm#10">1Joh 5:10-12</a>). Here is another aspect of God's foreknowledge. Since, from eternity past, God the Father knew His Son, He also foreknew those who were 'in Him.' (eg., As in Abraham, Levi was present, long before his birth. <a href="heb7.htm#9">Heb 7:9,10</a>)
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, we see that 'election' pertains to all who have (or will) become God's children, by simple faith in the One who drew them and purchased them, by and for Himself. While God has extended His Grace to all, the 'elect' respond in faith, and He births them into His family.
<li><b>Predestination - relates to becoming all that God wants His child to be.</b>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In <a href="eph1.htm#5" target="lwr_lt">v.5</a>, we see that God has predestinated {GK=proorizo, predestined, predetermined, fore-ordained, previously appointed} each of His children, to grow up to be mature sons. The phrase &quot;adoption of children&quot; is translated from one word {GK=huiothesia, establishment as a son}. This does not refer to adoption into God's family. Entrance into God's family requires new birth, through faith in Christ (<a href="joh3.htm#3">Joh 3:3</a>; <a href="joh1.htm#12">1:12,13</a>). Rather, &quot;adoption&quot; refers to a maturing child being &quot;placed as a son,&quot; into a position of privilege and responsibility in the Father's business.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God's purpose for each of His children is that they will reach that place of maturity that He intends for them.  It is &quot;the good pleasure of His will&quot; (v.5c), that we should be like His Beloved Son (<a href="rom8.htm#28">Rom 8:28-30</a>).
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Predestination does not pre-determine whether a man is destined for heaven or hell. But all who are God's children (the chosen ones, who have freely received the freely offered gift of salvation) are predestined to be fit for the Father's Presence.</ul>
<dt>He hath made us accepted in the beloved...-
<dd>God gave His Beloved Son for us. Did He love us more than Him? No, He loves us because we are &quot;in Him.&quot; We were the enemies of God, dead in our trespasses and sins. But God sent His Son, to purchase us for Himself with His own blood. Because He came, and because we believed, &quot;He (God) has made us accepted in the Beloved.&quot; (<a href="eph1.htm#6" target="lwr_lt">Eph 1:6</a>)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Think about that. We are not acceptable before God because we are nice, or because we belong to a good church, or have good friends, or a good pastor. We are not acceptable because we hold right doctrine (although that is important), or because we read the right Bible version, or because of how hard we labor, or give to further the gospel.  The thing that makes us acceptable before God is that we are &quot;in Christ.&quot;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, if you are &quot;in Christ,&quot; God loves you with the same love that He has for His Beloved Son. Not more, not less, but the same love.<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some time ago, a sister, who was suffering with terminal cancer, told me that Matthew is one of her favorite Bible books, and that Matthew chapter 6 is one of her favorite chapters, and that the word &quot;is&quot; is her favorite word in that chapter: &quot;Thine <b><u>is</b></u> the kingdom and the power and the glory for ever. Amen&quot; (<a href="mat6.htm#13">Mat 6:13</a>). While we are in the world, waiting for the King to return, to establish His Kingdom, and to make all things new, we endure many troubles. Jesus warned us &quot;in the world ye shall have tribulation: but be of good cheer; I have overcome the world&quot; (<a href="joh16.htm#33">Joh 16:33</a>). You see, the King <b><u>is</b></u> on His throne. His children are secure &quot;though Satan should buffet, though trials should come...&quot;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But here, in Ephesians ch. 1, the operative word is not &quot;is&quot; but &quot;in.&quot;  All, that God's children have and are... their comfort, their blessed assurance, their hope, their life... is <b><u>in</b></u> Christ Jesus. We see this in the very first verse (<a href="eph1.htm#1" target="lwr_lt">v.1</a>)...<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The letter is addressed to &quot;the faithful <b><u>in</b></u> Christ Jesus.&quot; As we noted earlier, that does not mean those who are especially loyal to the work. The word &quot;faithful&quot; is the word for &quot;believing.&quot; Paul is writing to those whose confidence is in Christ Jesus. He is eternally the Christ, the anointed One, who came into the world as the God-man Jesus, to save His people from their sins.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When a person puts his or her faith in the Savior, the Holy Spirit baptizes that person into the body of Christ (<a href="1cor12.htm#12">1Cor 12:12,13</a>), and he or she becomes a born again child of God. &quot;Now if any man be <b><u>in</b></u> Christ, he is a new creature, old things are passed away, and behold all things are become new.&quot; (<a href="2cor5.htm#17">2Cor 5:17</a>)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="eph1.htm#2" target="lwr_lt">v.2,3</a>  tell us that God's children have been blessed with &quot;all spiritual blessings.&quot; These are not earthly gifts, but  blessings belonging to the realm of the King. In fact, these blessings are &quot;<b><u>in</b></u> Christ.&quot;<br> 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These blessings belong to...<ul><li>those whom God &quot;hath chosen <b><u>in</b></u> Him&quot;(<a href="eph1.htm#4" target="lwr_lt">v.4</a>)<li>those who are accepted <b><u>in</b></u> the Beloved (<a href="eph1.htm#6" target="lwr_lt">v.6</a>).<br>The word &quot;accepted&quot; is the same word which the angel used in addressing Mary as &quot;highly favored&quot; (<a href="luk1.htm#28">Luk 1:28</a>).</ul><dd>God has graced us beyond measure, because we are <b><u>in</b></u> His Beloved Son.</dl>
<dt><b><i>7 <u>In whom</u> we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of sins,<br>according to the riches of his grace;<br>
8 Wherein he hath abounded toward us in all wisdom and prudence;<br>
9 Having made known unto us the mystery of his will,<br>according to his good pleasure which he hath purposed in himself:</b></i></dt><dl>
<dt>In whom we have...<ul><li>redemption through His blood<li>the forgiveness of sins<li>the abundant riches of His grace, which God has bestowed on us through His wisdom and prudence. &quot;O the depth of the riches, both of the wisdom and knowledge of God! How unsearchable are his jugments and his ways past finding out&quot; (<a href="rom11.htm#33">Rom 11:33</a>).
<dt>These riches are &quot;<b><u>in</b></u> Christ.&quot; 
<dt>
They have been made known to us, (v.9c) according to God's good pleasure, which He purposed &quot;<b><u>in</b></u> Himself.&quot;</dl>
<dt><b><i>10 That in the dispensation of the fulness of times<br>he might gather together in one all things <u>in Christ</u>,<br>both which are in heaven, and which are on earth; [even] <u>in him</u>:</b></i></dt><dl>
<dt>All of God's purposes, in heaven and in earth, will reach their culmination,<dd>when they are summed up &quot;<b><u>in</b></u> Christ... even <b><u>in</b></u> Him,&quot; when the time comes for the establishment of His eternal Kingdom.</dl>
<dt><b><i>11 <u>In whom</u> also we have obtained an inheritance,<br>being predestinated according to the purpose of him<br>who worketh all things after the counsel of his own will:<br>12 That we should be to the praise of his glory, who first trusted <u>in Christ</u>.<br>13 <u>In whom</u> ye also [trusted],<br>after that ye heard the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation:<br><u>in whom</u> also after that ye believed,<br>ye were sealed with that holy Spirit of promise,<br>14 Which is the earnest of our inheritance<br>until the redemption of the purchased possession,<br>unto the praise of his glory.</b></i></dt><dl>
<dt><b><u>in</b></u> whom we have an inheritance...<dd>(which Peter tells us is &quot;an inheritance incorruptible, and undefiled, and that fadeth not away, reserved in heaven for you, who are kept by the power of God...&quot; <a href="1pet1.htm#4">1Pet 1:4,5</a>). Notice again, in <a href="eph1.htm#12" target="lwr_lt">v.12</a>, the purpose to which God has predestined His children: &quot;that we should be to the praise of His glory.&quot;
<dt>We who? We who &quot;first trusted&quot; or who &quot;did first place our hope&quot; &quot;<b><u>in</b></u> Christ.&quot;
<dd>&quot;<b><u>in</b></u> whom&quot; ye trusted... &quot;<b><u>in</b></u> whom&quot; ye believed... &quot;<b><u>in</b></u> whom&quot; ye were sealed (as the permanent possession of Christ, by the Holy Spirit's baptism and indwelling, <a href="2tim2.htm#19">2Tim 2:19</a>; <a href="eph4.htm#30">Eph 4:30</a>).<br>
<dt>Paul closes the chapter by praying for those who have placed their faith &quot;<b><u>in</b></u> the Lord Jesus.&quot;</dl>
<dt><b><i>15 Wherefore I also, after I heard of your faith <u>in the Lord Jesus</u>,<br>and love unto all the saints,<br>
16 Cease not to give thanks for you, making mention of you in my prayers;<br>
17 That the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory,<br>may give unto you the spirit of wisdom and revelation <u>in the knowledge of him</u>:<br>
18 The eyes of your understanding being enlightened;<br>that ye may know what is the hope of his calling,<br>and what the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the saints,</b></i></dt><dl>
<dt>Paul prays...<ol type="1"><li>that believers would be able to comprehend the greatness of the tremendous spiritual blessings which belong to them, because they are <b><u>in</b></u> Christ, and therefore belong to Him (<a href="eph1.htm#18" target="lwr_lt">v.18</a>).<li>that we might understand the greatness of God's power exercised in the behalf of those who believe: the same power which He exercised &quot;<b><u>in</b></u> Christ, when He raised Him from the dead&quot; (<a href="eph1.htm#19" target="lwr_lt">v.19,20</a>).</ol></dl>
<dt><b><i>19 And what [is] the exceeding greatness of his power to us-ward who believe,<br>according to the working of his mighty power,<br>
20 Which he wrought <u>in Christ</u>, when he raised him from the dead,<br>and set [him] at his own right hand in the heavenly [places],<br>
21 Far above all principality, and power, and might, and dominion,<br>and every name that is named, not only in this world, but also in that which is to come:<br>
22 And hath put all [things] under his feet,<br>and gave him [to be] the head over all [things] to the church,<br>
23 Which is his body, the fulness of him that filleth all in all.</b></i></dt><dl>
<dt>Paul prays thirdly...<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. That we would understand and appreciate the greatness of position to which God the Father has exalted His Beloved Son (<a href="eph1.htm#20" target="lwr_lt">v.20-23</a>).<dd>The love of God the Father could not be more profoundly displayed for &quot;My Son, the Beloved.&quot;<ul><li>He has placed Him in a position of dominion over every entity which holds any authority, whether men or spirit beings.<li>He has set Him to be the head of His body, the church, the assembly of those who are &quot;<b><u>in</b></u> Him.&quot;
<dt>Do you understand that the Head and the Body are inseparably one?<dd>The body is &quot;the fulness of Him that filleth all in all.&quot; The body fulfills and complements the Head. He fills every portion of His body.<br>&quot;...I am in my Father, and ye in me, and I in you.&quot; (<a href="joh14.htm#20">Joh 14:20</a>)<br>&quot;...He that abideth in me and I in him, the same bringeth forth much fruit: for without me ye can do nothing.&quot; (<a href="joh15.htm#5">Joh 15:5</a>)<br>
&quot;If ye then be risen with Christ, seek those things which are above, where Christ sitteth on the right hand of God. Set your affection on things above, not on things on the earth. For ye are dead, and your life is hid with Christ in God. When Christ, who is our life shall appear, then shall ye also appear with Him in glory.&quot; (<a href="col3.htm#1">Col 3:1-4</a>)<br></ul>
<dt>With these things in mind, read again <a href="eph1.htm#3" target="lwr_lt">v.3-8</a>.
