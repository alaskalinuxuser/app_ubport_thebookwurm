Zechariah   3<br>1. And he shewed me Joshua the high priest standing before the angel of the LORD, and Satan standing at his right hand to resist him.<br><a name="2">2</a>  And the LORD said unto Satan, The LORD rebuke thee, O Satan; even the LORD that hath chosen Jerusalem rebuke thee: [is] not this a brand plucked out of the fire?<br><a name="3">3</a>  Now Joshua was clothed with filthy garments, and stood before the angel.<br><a name="4">4</a>  And he answered and spake unto those that stood before him, saying, Take away the filthy garments from him. And unto him he said, Behold, I have caused thine iniquity to pass from thee, and I will clothe thee with change of raiment.<br><a name="5">5</a>  And I said, Let them set a fair mitre upon his head. So they set a fair mitre upon his head, and clothed him with garments. And the angel of the LORD stood by.<br><a name="6">6</a>  And the angel of the LORD protested unto Joshua, saying,<br><a name="7">7</a>  Thus saith the LORD of hosts; If thou wilt walk in my ways, and if thou wilt keep my charge, then thou shalt also judge my house, and shalt also keep my courts, and I will give thee places to walk among these that stand by.<br><a name="8">8</a>. Hear now, O Joshua the high priest, thou, and thy fellows that sit before thee: for they [are] men wondered at: for, behold, I will bring forth my servant the BRANCH.<br><a name="9">9</a>  For behold the stone that I have laid before Joshua; upon one stone [shall be] seven eyes: behold, I will engrave the graving thereof, saith the LORD of hosts, and I will remove the iniquity of that land in one day.<br><a name="10">10</a>  In that day, saith the LORD of hosts, shall ye call every man his neighbour under the vine and under the fig tree.<br><br>Go to <a href="zech4.htm#1">Zechariah 4</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
