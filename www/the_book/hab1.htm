Habakkuk   1<br>1. The burden which Habakkuk the prophet did see.<br><a name="2">2</a>  O LORD, how long shall I cry, and thou wilt not hear! [even] cry out unto thee [of] violence, and thou wilt not save!<br><a name="3">3</a>  Why dost thou shew me iniquity, and cause [me] to behold grievance? for spoiling and violence [are] before me: and there are [that] raise up strife and contention.<br><a name="4">4</a>  Therefore the law is slacked, and judgment doth never go forth: for the wicked doth compass about the righteous; therefore wrong judgment proceedeth.<br><a name="5">5</a>. Behold ye among the heathen, and regard, and wonder marvellously: for [I] will work a work in your days, [which] ye will not believe, though it be told [you].<br><a name="6">6</a>  For, lo, I raise up the Chaldeans, [that] bitter and hasty nation, which shall march through the breadth of the land, to possess the dwellingplaces [that are] not theirs.<br><a name="7">7</a>  They [are] terrible and dreadful: their judgment and their dignity shall proceed of themselves.<br><a name="8">8</a>  Their horses also are swifter than the leopards, and are more fierce than the evening wolves: and their horsemen shall spread themselves, and their horsemen shall come from far; they shall fly as the eagle [that] hasteth to eat.<br><a name="9">9</a>  They shall come all for violence: their faces shall sup up [as] the east wind, and they shall gather the captivity as the sand.<br><a name="10">10</a>  And they shall scoff at the kings, and the princes shall be a scorn unto them: they shall deride every strong hold; for they shall heap dust, and take it.<br><a name="11">11</a>  Then shall [his] mind change, and he shall pass over, and offend, [imputing] this his power unto his god.<br><a name="12">12</a>. [Art] thou not from everlasting, O LORD my God, mine Holy One? we shall not die. O LORD, thou hast ordained them for judgment; and, O mighty God, thou hast established them for correction.<br><a name="13">13</a>  [Thou art] of purer eyes than to behold evil, and canst not look on iniquity: wherefore lookest thou upon them that deal treacherously, [and] holdest thy tongue when the wicked devoureth [the man that is] more righteous than he?<br><a name="14">14</a>  And makest men as the fishes of the sea, as the creeping things, [that have] no ruler over them?<br><a name="15">15</a>  They take up all of them with the angle, they catch them in their net, and gather them in their drag: therefore they rejoice and are glad.<br><a name="16">16</a>  Therefore they sacrifice unto their net, and burn incense unto their drag; because by them their portion [is] fat, and their meat plenteous.<br><a name="17">17</a>  Shall they therefore empty their net, and not spare continually to slay the nations?<br><br>Go to <a href="hab2.htm#1">Habakkuk 2</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
