Ezekiel  21<br>1. And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,<br><a name="2">2</a>  Son of man, set thy face toward Jerusalem, and drop [thy word] toward the holy places, and prophesy against the land of Israel,<br><a name="3">3</a>  And say to the land of Israel, Thus saith the LORD; Behold, I [am] against thee, and will draw forth my sword out of his sheath, and will cut off from thee the righteous and the wicked.<br><a name="4">4</a>  Seeing then that I will cut off from thee the righteous and the wicked, therefore shall my sword go forth out of his sheath against all flesh from the south to the north:<br><a name="5">5</a>  That all flesh may know that I the LORD have drawn forth my sword out of his sheath: it shall not return any more.<br><a name="6">6</a>  Sigh therefore, thou son of man, with the breaking of [thy] loins; and with bitterness sigh before their eyes.<br><a name="7">7</a>  And it shall be, when they say unto thee, Wherefore sighest thou? that thou shalt answer, For the tidings; because it cometh: and every heart shall melt, and all hands shall be feeble, and every spirit shall faint, and all knees shall be weak [as] water: behold, it cometh, and shall be brought to pass, saith the Lord GOD.<br><a name="8">8</a>. Again the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,<br><a name="9">9</a>  Son of man, prophesy, and say, Thus saith the LORD; Say, A sword, a sword is sharpened, and also furbished:<br><a name="10">10</a>  It is sharpened to make a sore slaughter; it is furbished that it may glitter: should we then make mirth? it contemneth the rod of my son, [as] every tree.<br><a name="11">11</a>  And he hath given it to be furbished, that it may be handled: this sword is sharpened, and it is furbished, to give it into the hand of the slayer.<br><a name="12">12</a>  Cry and howl, son of man: for it shall be upon my people, it [shall be] upon all the princes of Israel: terrors by reason of the sword shall be upon my people: smite therefore upon [thy] thigh.<br><a name="13">13</a>  Because [it is] a trial, and what if [the sword] contemn even the rod? it shall be no [more], saith the Lord GOD.<br><a name="14">14</a>  Thou therefore, son of man, prophesy, and smite [thine] hands together, and let the sword be doubled the third time, the sword of the slain: it [is] the sword of the great [men that are] slain, which entereth into their privy chambers.<br><a name="15">15</a>  I have set the point of the sword against all their gates, that [their] heart may faint, and [their] ruins be multiplied: ah! [it is] made bright, [it is] wrapped up for the slaughter.<br><a name="16">16</a>  Go thee one way or other, [either] on the right hand, [or] on the left, whithersoever thy face [is] set.<br><a name="17">17</a>  I will also smite mine hands together, and I will cause my fury to rest: I the LORD have said [it].<br><a name="18">18</a>. The word of the LORD came unto me again, saying,<br><a name="19">19</a>  Also, thou son of man, appoint thee two ways, that the sword of the king of Babylon may come: both twain shall come forth out of one land: and choose thou a place, choose [it] at the head of the way to the city.<br><a name="20">20</a>  Appoint a way, that the sword may come to Rabbath of the Ammonites, and to Judah in Jerusalem the defenced.<br><a name="21">21</a>  For the king of Babylon stood at the parting of the way, at the head of the two ways, to use divination: he made [his] arrows bright, he consulted with images, he looked in the liver.<br><a name="22">22</a>  At his right hand was the divination for Jerusalem, to appoint captains, to open the mouth in the slaughter, to lift up the voice with shouting, to appoint [battering] rams against the gates, to cast a mount, [and] to build a fort.<br><a name="23">23</a>  And it shall be unto them as a false divination in their sight, to them that have sworn oaths: but he will call to remembrance the iniquity, that they may be taken.<br><a name="24">24</a>  Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Because ye have made your iniquity to be remembered, in that your transgressions are discovered, so that in all your doings your sins do appear; because, [I say], that ye are come to remembrance, ye shall be taken with the hand.<br><a name="25">25</a>  And thou, profane wicked prince of Israel, whose day is come, when iniquity [shall have] an end,<br><a name="26">26</a>  Thus saith the Lord GOD; Remove the diadem, and take off the crown: this [shall] not [be] the same: exalt [him that is] low, and abase [him that is] high.<br><a name="27">27</a>  I will overturn, overturn, overturn, it: and it shall be no [more], until he come whose right it is; and I will give it [him].<br><a name="28">28</a>. And thou, son of man, prophesy and say, Thus saith the Lord GOD concerning the Ammonites, and concerning their reproach; even say thou, The sword, the sword [is] drawn: for the slaughter [it is] furbished, to consume because of the glittering:<br><a name="29">29</a>  Whiles they see vanity unto thee, whiles they divine a lie unto thee, to bring thee upon the necks of [them that are] slain, of the wicked, whose day is come, when their iniquity [shall have] an end.<br><a name="30">30</a>  Shall I cause [it] to return into his sheath? I will judge thee in the place where thou wast created, in the land of thy nativity.<br><a name="31">31</a>  And I will pour out mine indignation upon thee, I will blow against thee in the fire of my wrath, and deliver thee into the hand of brutish men, [and] skilful to destroy.<br><a name="32">32</a>  Thou shalt be for fuel to the fire; thy blood shall be in the midst of the land; thou shalt be no [more] remembered: for I the LORD have spoken [it].<br><br>Go to <a href="eze22.htm#1">Ezekiel 22</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
