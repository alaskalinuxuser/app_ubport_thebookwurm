<dt><b><i>39:1 And Joseph was brought down to Egypt;<br>
and Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh, captain of the guard, an Egyptian,<br>bought him of the hands of the Ishmeelites, which had brought him down thither.<br>
39:2 And the LORD was with Joseph, and he was a prosperous man;<br>and he was in the house of his master the Egyptian. </i></b>{cp. <a href="gen28.htm#15">Gen 28:15</a>; <a href="isa41.htm#10">Isa 41:10</a>; <a href="isa43.htm#2">43:2</a>}<b><i><br>
39:3 And his master saw that the LORD [was] with him,<br>and that the LORD made all that he did to prosper in his hand. </b></i>{cp. <a href="mat5.htm#16">Mat 5:16</a>; <a href="php2.htm#15">Php 2:15,16</a>}<i><b><br>
39:4 And Joseph found grace in his sight, and he served him:<br>and he made him overseer over his house, and all [that] he had he put into his hand.<br>
39:5 And it came to pass from the time [that] he had made him overseer in his house,<br>and over all that he had, that the LORD blessed the Egyptian's house for Joseph's sake;<br>and the blessing of the LORD was upon all that he had in the house, and in the field.<br>
39:6 And he left all that he had in Joseph's hand;<br>and he knew not ought he had, save the bread which he did eat. </i></b></dt><dl>
<dt>Joseph's experience in Egypt illustrates that God uses even difficult circumstances
<dd>to accomplish His purposes in the lives of His children. cp. <a href="rom8.htm#28">Rom 8:28</a>; <a href="heb12.htm#6">Heb 12:6</a><br>
Although God knew His plans for Joseph, and had given him hints concerning the final outcome (<a href="gen37.htm#6">37:6-11</a>), Joseph could not see the intervening steps. He had to trust God through the trials and reversals of life.
<dt>Joseph, as a servant, was faithful, prosperous and trusted.
cp. <a href="mat25.htm#21">Mat 25:21</a>; <a href="1cor7.htm#20">1Cor 7:20-24</a>; <a href="tit2.htm#9">Titus 2:9,10</a>
</dl><dt>
<b><i>And Joseph was [a] goodly [person], and well favoured.<br>
39:7 And it came to pass after these things, that his master's wife cast her eyes upon Joseph;<br>and she said, Lie with me.<br>
39:8 But he refused, and said unto his master's wife,<br>
Behold, my master wotteth </b></i>{ie., knoweth}<b><i> not what [is] with me in the house,<br>
and he hath committed all that he hath to my hand;<br>
39:9 [There is] none greater in this house than I;<br>
neither hath he kept back any thing from me but thee, because thou [art] his wife:<br>how then can I do this great wickedness, and sin against God?<br>
39:10 And it came to pass, as she spake to Joseph day by day,<br>that he hearkened not unto her, to lie by her, [or] to be with her.</i></b> {cp. <a href="pro6.htm#25">Prov 6:25,26</a>}</dt><dl>
<dt>Joseph's rebuttal to temptation-<ol type="a">
<li>my master trusts me.- He recognized his responsibility to his employer.
<li>you are someone's wife.- He viewed marriage as a sacred contract, not to be defiled. cp. <a href="heb13.htm#4">Heb 13:4</a>
<li>I am accountable to God.- He knew that such impropriety would dishonor the name of his God. cp. <a href="psa51.htm#4">Psa 51:4</a><br>
Joseph, as a seventeen year old boy (<a href="gen37.htm#2">37:2</a>), far from family oversight, and in an ungodly environment, was determined to serve God. Joseph's determination to maintain sexual purity is in sharp contrast to his brother Judah (ch.38).<br></ol>
</dl><dt>
<b><i>39:11 And it came to pass about this time, that [Joseph] went into the house to do his business;<br>and [there was] none of the men of the house there within.<br>
39:12 And she caught him by his garment, saying, Lie with me:<br>and he left his garment in her hand, and fled, and got him out. </b></i><dd>{cp. <a href="pro7.htm#13">Prov 7:13-27</a>; <a href="ecc7.htm#26">Ecc 7:26</a>; <a href="1cor6.htm#18">1Cor 6:18</a>; <a href="2tim2.htm#22">2Tim 2:22</a>}<i><b><dt>
39:13 And it came to pass, when she saw that he had left his garment in her hand, and was fled forth,<br>
39:14 That she called unto the men of her house, and spake unto them, saying,<br>See, he hath brought in an Hebrew unto us to mock us;<br>he came in unto me to lie with me, and I cried with a loud voice:<br>
39:15 And it came to pass, when he heard that I lifted up my voice and cried,<br>that he left his garment with me, and fled, and got him out.<br>
39:16 And she laid up his garment by her, until his lord came home.<br>
39:17 And she spake unto him according to these words, saying,<br>The Hebrew servant, which thou hast brought unto us, came in unto me to mock me:<br>
39:18 And it came to pass, as I lifted up my voice and cried,<br>that he left his garment with me, and fled out.<br>
39:19 And it came to pass, when his master heard the words of his wife, which she spake unto him,<br>saying, After this manner did thy servant to me; that his wrath was kindled.<br>
39:20 And Joseph's master took him, and put him into the prison,<br>a place where the king's prisoners [were] bound: and he was there in the prison.</i></b></dt><dl>
<dt><b>Both Joseph and Jesus were-</b><ol start="16" type="1">

<b><i>39:21 But the LORD was with Joseph, and shewed him mercy,<br>and gave him favour in the sight of the keeper of the prison.<br>
39:22 And the keeper of the prison committed to Joseph's hand<br>all the prisoners that [were] in the prison;<br>and whatsoever they did there, he was the doer [of it].<br>
39:23 The keeper of the prison looked not to any thing [that was] under his hand;<br>because the LORD was with him, and [that] which he did, the LORD made [it] to prosper.</i></b></dt><dl>
<dt>the LORD made it to prosper.-
<dd>cp. <a href="pro16.htm#7">Prov 16:7</a>; <a href="psa37.htm#1">Psa 37:1-18</a>; <a href="1pet4.htm#14">1Pet 4:14-16</a>; <a href="rom8.htm#31">Rom 8:31-39</a>
<dt>While Joseph knew the LORD was with him, and that He was enabling his prison service to be successful and appreciated, <dd>he must have wondered why his life appeared to be going nowhere, while others prospered (cp. <a href="jer12.htm#1">Jer 12:1</a>, where 'prosper' is the same HB word).<br>The faithful servant trusts and waits for his Lord's word and action. cp. <a href="psa27.htm#13">Psa 27:13,14</a>; <a href="psa40.htm#1">40:1</a>
