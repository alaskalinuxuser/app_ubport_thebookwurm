1Corinthians   5<br>1. It is reported commonly [that there is] fornication among you, and such fornication as is not so much as named among the Gentiles, that one should have his father's wife.<br><a name="2">2</a>  And ye are puffed up, and have not rather mourned, that he that hath done this deed might be taken away from among you.<br><a name="3">3</a>  For I verily, as absent in body, but present in spirit, have judged already, as though I were present, [concerning] him that hath so done this deed,<br><a name="4">4</a>  In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, when ye are gathered together, and my spirit, with the power of our Lord Jesus Christ,<br><a name="5">5</a>  To deliver such an one unto Satan for the destruction of the flesh, that the spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus.<br><a name="6">6</a>  Your glorying [is] not good.

Therefore put away from among yourselves that wicked person.<br><br>Go to <a href="1cor6.htm#1">I Corinthians 6</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
