Jeremiah  48<br>1. Against Moab thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Woe unto Nebo! for it is spoiled: Kiriathaim is confounded [and] taken: Misgab is confounded and dismayed.<br><a name="2">2</a>  [There shall be] no more praise of Moab: in Heshbon they have devised evil against it; come, and let us cut it off from [being] a nation. Also thou shalt be cut down, O Madmen; the sword shall pursue thee.<br><a name="3">3</a>  A voice of crying [shall be] from Horonaim, spoiling and great destruction.<br><a name="4">4</a>  Moab is destroyed; her little ones have caused a cry to be heard.<br><a name="5">5</a>  For in the going up of Luhith continual weeping shall go up; for in the going down of Horonaim the enemies have heard a cry of destruction.<br><a name="6">6</a>  Flee, save your lives, and be like the heath in the wilderness.<br><a name="7">7</a>  For because thou hast trusted in thy works and in thy treasures, thou shalt also be taken: and Chemosh shall go forth into captivity [with] his priests and his princes together.<br><a name="8">8</a>  And the spoiler shall come upon every city, and no city shall escape: the valley also shall perish, and the plain shall be destroyed, as the LORD hath spoken.<br><a name="9">9</a>  Give wings unto Moab, that it may flee and get away: for the cities thereof shall be desolate, without any to dwell therein.<br><a name="10">10</a>  Cursed [be] he that doeth the work of the LORD deceitfully, and cursed [be] he that keepeth back his sword from blood.<br><a name="11">11</a>  Moab hath been at ease from his youth, and he hath settled on his lees, and hath not been emptied from vessel to vessel, neither hath he gone into captivity: therefore his taste remained in him, and his scent is not changed.<br><a name="12">12</a>  Therefore, behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will send unto him wanderers, that shall cause him to wander, and shall empty his vessels, and break their bottles.<br><a name="13">13</a>  And Moab shall be ashamed of Chemosh, as the house of Israel was ashamed of Bethel their confidence.<br><a name="14">14</a>. How say ye, We [are] mighty and strong men for the war?<br><a name="15">15</a>  Moab is spoiled, and gone up [out of] her cities, and his chosen young men are gone down to the slaughter, saith the King, whose name [is] the LORD of hosts.<br><a name="16">16</a>  The calamity of Moab [is] near to come, and his affliction hasteth fast.<br><a name="17">17</a>  All ye that are about him, bemoan him; and all ye that know his name, say, How is the strong staff broken, [and] the beautiful rod!<br><a name="18">18</a>  Thou daughter that dost inhabit Dibon, come down from [thy] glory, and sit in thirst; for the spoiler of Moab shall come upon thee, [and] he shall destroy thy strong holds.<br><a name="19">19</a>  O inhabitant of Aroer, stand by the way, and espy; ask him that fleeth, and her that escapeth, [and] say, What is done?<br><a name="20">20</a>  Moab is confounded; for it is broken down: howl and cry; tell ye it in Arnon, that Moab is spoiled,<br><a name="21">21</a>  And judgment is come upon the plain country; upon Holon, and upon Jahazah, and upon Mephaath,<br><a name="22">22</a>  And upon Dibon, and upon Nebo, and upon Bethdiblathaim,<br><a name="23">23</a>  And upon Kiriathaim, and upon Bethgamul, and upon Bethmeon,<br><a name="24">24</a>  And upon Kerioth, and upon Bozrah, and upon all the cities of the land of Moab, far or near.<br><a name="25">25</a>  The horn of Moab is cut off, and his arm is broken, saith the LORD.<br><a name="26">26</a>  Make ye him drunken: for he magnified [himself] against the LORD: Moab also shall wallow in his vomit, and he also shall be in derision.<br><a name="27">27</a>  For was not Israel a derision unto thee? was he found among thieves? for since thou spakest of him, thou skippedst for joy.<br><a name="28">28</a>  O ye that dwell in Moab, leave the cities, and dwell in the rock, and be like the dove [that] maketh her nest in the sides of the hole's mouth.<br><a name="29">29</a>  We have heard the pride of Moab, (he is exceeding proud) his loftiness, and his arrogancy, and his pride, and the haughtiness of his heart.<br><a name="30">30</a>  I know his wrath, saith the LORD; but [it shall] not [be] so; his lies shall not so effect [it].<br><a name="31">31</a>  Therefore will I howl for Moab, and I will cry out for all Moab; [mine heart] shall mourn for the men of Kirheres.<br><a name="32">32</a>  O vine of Sibmah, I will weep for thee with the weeping of Jazer: thy plants are gone over the sea, they reach [even] to the sea of Jazer: the spoiler is fallen upon thy summer fruits and upon thy vintage.<br><a name="33">33</a>  And joy and gladness is taken from the plentiful field, and from the land of Moab; and I have caused wine to fail from the winepresses: none shall tread with shouting; [their] shouting [shall be] no shouting.<br><a name="34">34</a>  From the cry of Heshbon [even] unto Elealeh, [and even] unto Jahaz, have they uttered their voice, from Zoar [even] unto Horonaim, [as] an heifer of three years old: for the waters also of Nimrim shall be desolate.<br><a name="35">35</a>  Moreover I will cause to cease in Moab, saith the LORD, him that offereth in the high places, and him that burneth incense to his gods.<br><a name="36">36</a>  Therefore mine heart shall sound for Moab like pipes, and mine heart shall sound like pipes for the men of Kirheres: because the riches [that] he hath gotten are perished.<br><a name="37">37</a>  For every head [shall be] bald, and every beard clipped: upon all the hands [shall be] cuttings, and upon the loins sackcloth.<br><a name="38">38</a>  [There shall be] lamentation generally upon all the housetops of Moab, and in the streets thereof: for I have broken Moab like a vessel wherein [is] no pleasure, saith the LORD.<br><a name="39">39</a>  They shall howl, [saying], How is it broken down! how hath Moab turned the back with shame! so shall Moab be a derision and a dismaying to all them about him.<br><a name="40">40</a>  For thus saith the LORD; Behold, he shall fly as an eagle, and shall spread his wings over Moab.<br><a name="41">41</a>  Kerioth is taken, and the strong holds are surprised, and the mighty men's hearts in Moab at that day shall be as the heart of a woman in her pangs.<br><a name="42">42</a>  And Moab shall be destroyed from [being] a people, because he hath magnified [himself] against the LORD.<br><a name="43">43</a>  Fear, and the pit, and the snare, [shall be] upon thee, O inhabitant of Moab, saith the LORD.<br><a name="44">44</a>  He that fleeth from the fear shall fall into the pit; and he that getteth up out of the pit shall be taken in the snare: for I will bring upon it, [even] upon Moab, the year of their visitation, saith the LORD.<br><a name="45">45</a>  They that fled stood under the shadow of Heshbon because of the force: but a fire shall come forth out of Heshbon, and a flame from the midst of Sihon, and shall devour the corner of Moab, and the crown of the head of the tumultuous ones.<br><a name="46">46</a>  Woe be unto thee, O Moab! the people of Chemosh perisheth: for thy sons are taken captives, and thy daughters captives.<br><a name="47">47</a>  Yet will I bring again the captivity of Moab in the latter days, saith the LORD.
