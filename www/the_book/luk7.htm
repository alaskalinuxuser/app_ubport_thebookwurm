Luke   7<br> 1. Now when he had ended all his sayings in the audience of the people, he entered into Capernaum.<br><a name="2">2</a>  And a certain centurion's servant, who was dear unto him, was sick, and ready to die.<br><a name="3">3</a>  And when he heard of Jesus, he sent unto him the elders of the Jews, beseeching him that he would come and heal his servant.<br><a name="4">4</a>  And when they came to Jesus, they besought him instantly, saying, That he was worthy for whom he should do this:<br><a name="5">5</a>  For he loveth our nation, and he hath built us a synagogue.<br><a name="6">6</a>  Then Jesus went with them. And when he was now not far from the house, the centurion sent friends to him, saying unto him, Lord, trouble not thyself: for I am not worthy that thou shouldest enter under my roof:<br><a name="7">7</a>  Wherefore neither thought I myself worthy to come unto thee: but say in a word, and my servant shall be healed.<br><a name="8">8</a>  For I also am a man set under authority, having under me soldiers, and I say unto one, Go, and he goeth; and to another, Come, and he cometh; and to my servant, Do this, and he doeth [it].<br><a name="9">9</a>  When Jesus heard these things, he marvelled at him, and turned him about, and said unto the people that followed him, I say unto you, I have not found so great faith, no, not in Israel.<br><a name="10">10</a>  And they that were sent, returning to the house, found the servant whole that had been sick.<br><a name="11">11</a>. And it came to pass the day after, that he went into a city called Nain; and many of his disciples went with him, and much people.<br><a name="12">12</a>  Now when he came nigh to the gate of the city, behold, there was a dead man carried out, the only son of his mother, and she was a widow: and much people of the city was with her.<br><a name="13">13</a>  And when the Lord saw her, he had compassion on her, and said unto her, Weep not.<br><a name="14">14</a>  And he came and touched the bier: and they that bare [him] stood still. And he said, Young man, I say unto thee, Arise.<br><a name="15">15</a>  And he that was dead sat up, and began to speak. And he delivered him to his mother.<br><a name="16">16</a>  And there came a fear on all: and they glorified God, saying, That a great prophet is risen up among us; and, That God hath visited his people.<br><a name="17">17</a>  And this rumour of him went forth throughout all Judaea, and throughout all the region round about.<br><a name="18">18</a>  And the disciples of John shewed him of all these things.<br><a name="19">19</a>. And John calling [unto him] two of his disciples sent [them] to Jesus, saying, Art thou he that should come? or look we for another?<br><a name="20">20</a>  When the men were come unto him, they said, John Baptist hath sent us unto thee, saying, Art thou he that should come? or look we for another?<br><a name="21">21</a>  And in that same hour he cured many of [their] infirmities and plagues, and of evil spirits; and unto many [that were] blind he gave sight.<br><a name="22">22</a>  Then Jesus answering said unto them, Go your way, and tell John what things ye have seen and heard; how that the blind see, the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead are raised, to the poor the gospel is preached.<br><a name="23">23</a>  And blessed is [he], whosoever shall not be offended in me.<br><a name="24">24</a>  And when the messengers of John were departed, he began to speak unto the people concerning John, What went ye out into the wilderness for to see? A reed shaken with the wind?<br><a name="25">25</a>  But what went ye out for to see? A man clothed in soft raiment? Behold, they which are gorgeously apparelled, and live delicately, are in kings' courts.<br><a name="26">26</a>  But what went ye out for to see? A prophet? Yea, I say unto you, and much more than a prophet.<br><a name="27">27</a>  This is [he], of whom it is written, Behold, I send my messenger before thy face, which shall prepare thy way before thee.<br><a name="28">28</a>  For I say unto you, Among those that are born of women there is not a greater prophet than John the Baptist: but he that is least in the kingdom of God is greater than he.<br><a name="29">29</a>  And all the people that heard [him], and the publicans, justified God, being baptized with the baptism of John.<br><a name="30">30</a>  But the Pharisees and lawyers rejected the counsel of God against themselves, being not baptized of him.<br><a name="31">31</a>  And the Lord said, Whereunto then shall I liken the men of this generation? and to what are they like?<br><a name="32">32</a>  They are like unto children sitting in the marketplace, and calling one to another, and saying, We have piped unto you, and ye have not danced; we have mourned to you, and ye have not wept.<br><a name="33">33</a>  For John the Baptist came neither eating bread nor drinking wine; and ye say, He hath a devil.<br><a name="34">34</a>  The Son of man is come eating and drinking; and ye say, Behold a gluttonous man, and a winebibber, a friend of publicans and sinners!<br><a name="35">35</a>  But wisdom is justified of all her children.<br><a name="36">36</a>. And one of the Pharisees desired him that he would eat with him. And he went into the Pharisee's house, and sat down to meat.<br><a name="37">37</a>  And, behold, a woman in the city, which was a sinner, when she knew that [Jesus] sat at meat in the Pharisee's house, brought an alabaster box of ointment,<br><a name="38">38</a>  And stood at his feet behind [him] weeping, and began to wash his feet with tears, and did wipe [them] with the hairs of her head, and kissed his feet, and anointed [them] with the ointment.<br><a name="39">39</a>  Now when the Pharisee which had bidden him saw [it], he spake within himself, saying, This man, if he were a prophet, would have known who and what manner of woman [this is] that toucheth him: for she is a sinner.<br><a name="40">40</a>  And Jesus answering said unto him, Simon, I have somewhat to say unto thee. And he saith, Master, say on.<br><a name="41">41</a>  There was a certain creditor which had two debtors: the one owed five hundred pence, and the other fifty.<br><a name="42">42</a>  And when they had nothing to pay, he frankly forgave them both. Tell me therefore, which of them will love him most?<br><a name="43">43</a>  Simon answered and said, I suppose that [he], to whom he forgave most. And he said unto him, Thou hast rightly judged.<br><a name="44">44</a>  And he turned to the woman, and said unto Simon, Seest thou this woman? I entered into thine house, thou gavest me no water for my feet: but she hath washed my feet with tears, and wiped [them] with the hairs of her head.<br><a name="45">45</a>  Thou gavest me no kiss: but this woman since the time I came in hath not ceased to kiss my feet.<br><a name="46">46</a>  My head with oil thou didst not anoint: but this woman hath anointed my feet with ointment.<br><a name="47">47</a>  Wherefore I say unto thee, Her sins, which are many, are forgiven; for she loved much: but to whom little is forgiven, [the same] loveth little.<br><a name="48">48</a>  And he said unto her, Thy sins are forgiven.<br><a name="49">49</a>  And they that sat at meat with him began to say within themselves, Who is this that forgiveth sins also?<br><a name="50">50</a>  And he said to the woman, Thy faith hath saved thee; go in peace.<br><br>Go to <a href="luk8.htm#1">Luke 8</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
