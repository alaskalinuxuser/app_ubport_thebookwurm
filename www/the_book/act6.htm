Acts   6<br>1. And in those days, when the number of the disciples was multiplied, there arose a murmuring of the Grecians against the Hebrews, because their widows were neglected in the daily ministration.<br><a name="2">2</a>  Then the twelve called the multitude of the disciples [unto them], and said, It is not reason that we should leave the word of God, and serve tables.<br><a name="3">3</a>  Wherefore, brethren, look ye out among you seven men of honest report, full of the Holy Ghost and wisdom, whom we may appoint over this business.<br><a name="4">4</a>  But we will give ourselves continually to prayer, and to the ministry of the word.<br><a name="5">5</a>  And the saying pleased the whole multitude: and they chose Stephen, a man full of faith and of the Holy Ghost, and Philip, and Prochorus, and Nicanor, and Timon, and Parmenas, and Nicolas a proselyte of Antioch:<br><a name="6">6</a>  Whom they set before the apostles: and when they had prayed, they laid [their] hands on them.<br><a name="7">7</a>  And the word of God increased; and the number of the disciples multiplied in Jerusalem greatly; and a great company of the priests were obedient to the faith.<br><a name="8">8</a>.
