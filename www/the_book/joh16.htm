These things have I spoken unto you, that ye should not be offended.<br><a name="2">2</a>  They shall put you out of the synagogues: yea, the time cometh, that whosoever killeth you will think that he doeth God service.<br><a name="3">3</a>  And these things will they do unto you, because they have not known the Father, nor me.<br><a name="4">4</a>  But these things have I told you, that when the time shall come, ye may remember that I told you of them. And these things I said not unto you at the beginning, because I was with you.<br><a name="5">5</a>  But now I go my way to him that sent me; and none of you asketh me, Whither goest thou?<br><a name="6">6</a>  But because I have said these things unto you, sorrow hath filled your heart.<br><a name="7">7</a>. Nevertheless I tell you the truth; It is expedient for you that I go away: for if I go not away, the Comforter will not come unto you; but if I depart, I will send him unto you.<br><a name="8">8</a>  And when he is come, he will reprove the world of sin, and of righteousness, and of judgment:<br><a name="9">9</a>  Of sin, because they believe not on me;<br><a name="10">10</a>  Of righteousness, because I go to my Father, and ye see me no more;<br><a name="11">11</a>  Of judgment, because the prince of this world is judged.<br><a name="12">12</a>  I have yet many things to say unto you, but ye cannot bear them now.<br><a name="13">13</a>  Howbeit when he, the Spirit of truth, is come, he will guide you into all truth: for he shall not speak of himself; but whatsoever he shall hear, [that] shall he speak: and he will shew you things to come.<br><a name="14">14</a>  He shall glorify me: for he shall receive of mine, and shall shew [it] unto you.<br><a name="15">15</a>  All things that the Father hath are mine: therefore said I, that he shall take of mine, and shall shew [it] unto you.<br> <a name="16"></a>16. A little while, and ye shall not see me: and again, a little while, and ye shall see me, because I go to the Father.<br><a name="17">17</a>  Then said [some] of his disciples among themselves, What is this that he saith unto us, A little while, and ye shall not see me: and again, a little while, and ye shall see me: and, Because I go to the Father?<br><a name="18">18</a>  They said therefore, What is this that he saith, A little while? we cannot tell what he saith.<br><a name="19">19</a>  Now Jesus knew that they were desirous to ask him, and said unto them, Do ye enquire among yourselves of that I said, A little while, and ye shall not see me: and again, a little while, and ye shall see me?<br><a name="20">20</a>  Verily, verily, I say unto you, That ye shall weep and lament, but the world shall rejoice: and ye shall be sorrowful, but your sorrow shall be turned into joy.<br><a name="21">21</a>  A woman when she is in travail hath sorrow, because her hour is come: but as soon as she is delivered of the child, she remembereth no more the anguish, for joy that a man is born into the world.<br><a name="22">22</a>  And ye now therefore have sorrow: but I will see you again, and your heart shall rejoice, and your joy no man taketh from you.<br><a name="23">23</a>. And in that day ye shall ask me nothing. Verily, verily, I say unto you, Whatsoever ye shall ask the Father in my name, he will give [it] you.<br><a name="24">24</a>  Hitherto have ye asked nothing in my name: ask, and ye shall receive, that your joy may be full.<br><a name="25">25</a>  These things have I spoken unto you in proverbs: but the time cometh, when I shall no more speak unto you in proverbs, but I shall shew you plainly of the Father.<br><a name="26">26</a>  At that day ye shall ask in my name: and I say not unto you, that I will pray the Father for you:<br><a name="27">27</a>  For the Father himself loveth you, because ye have loved me, and have believed that I came out from God.<br><a name="28">28</a>. I came forth from the Father, and am come into the world: again, I leave the world, and go to the Father.<br><a name="29">29</a>  His disciples said unto him, Lo, now speakest thou plainly, and speakest no proverb.<br><a name="30">30</a>  Now are we sure that thou knowest all things, and needest not that any man should ask thee: by this we believe that thou camest forth from God.<br><a name="31">31</a>  Jesus answered them, Do ye now believe?<br><a name="32">32</a>  Behold, the hour cometh, yea, is now come, that ye shall be scattered, every man to his own, and shall leave me alone: and yet I am not alone, because the Father is with me.<br><a name="33">33</a>  These things I have spoken unto you, that in me ye might have peace. In the world ye shall have tribulation: but be of good cheer; I have overcome the world.<br><br>Go to <a href="joh17.htm#1">John 17</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
