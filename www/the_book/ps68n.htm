<b><a href="psa68.htm#1" target="lwr_lt">PSALM 68</a> - Messiah: The LORD who goes before His people </b>(to bring them into their rest).<br><dl>
<dt><i><b>68:1 To the chief Musician, A Psalm [or] Song of David.<br>
Let God arise, let his enemies be scattered:<br>
let them also that hate him flee before him. </b></i></dt><dl>
<dt>Moses spoke these words when the Ark set out before Israel in the wilderness. (<a href="num10.htm#33">Num 10:33-36</a>)
<dd>Likewise, the Lord goes before His people in all ages. (This theme is briefly stated in <a href="psa68.htm#1" target="lwr_lt">v.1-6</a>.)
<dt>The remainder of this psalm provides a time line of the Lord's going before His people Israel,
<dd>in several specific periods of history (some are yet future). There is but One God, who goes before His people to accomplish His purposes, as history is rolled out like a pre-written scroll. In this Psalm, we are spectators, observing, as...<br>the Lord...<ol type="A">
<li>Brings Israel out of Egypt and through the wilderness, <a href="psa68.htm#7" target="lwr_lt">v.7-10</a>
<li>Leads Israel into the Promised Land and displaces its occupants, v.11-14
<li>Watches over Jerusalem, during Israel's dispersions, in the Times of the Gentiles, v.15-17
<li>Ascends into Heaven, having made full provision for His own, v.18-20
<li>Judges His enemies, and restores His people, v.21-23
<li>Returns to the Sanctuary, to dwell among His people, v.24-27
<li>Reigns over all the earth, in His Millennial Kingdom, v.28-35</ol>
<dt>Let God arise...- In every age, God's people are dependent upon Him
<dd>for His protection and deliverance from their enemies,<br>and for His merciful provision of their daily needs.</dl>

<dt>B. The Lord led Israel into the Promised Land and displaced its occupants, <a href="psa68.htm#11" target="lwr_lt">v.11-14</a>.
<dt><i><b>68:11 The Lord gave the word:</b></i>

<dd>The people proclaim what He has done, in the following song (v.12-14)...</dl>
<dt><i><b>68:12 Kings of armies did flee apace:</b></i>
<dd>eg., <a href="ex14.htm#25">Ex 14:25</a>; <a href="num31.htm#8">Num 31:8</a>; <a href="josh10.htm#42">Josh 10:42</a><br>

<dt><i><b>68:13 Though ye have lien among the pots, [yet shall ye be as] the wings of a dove<br>
covered with silver, and her feathers with yellow gold.</b></i></dt><dl>
<dt>lien among the pots- alternate reading &quot;remained among the sheepfolds...&quot;
<dd>Even those disengaged from the battle, and tending to less dangerous tasks,
share the reward of His battle on their behalf. (cp. <a href="judg5.htm#16">Judg 5:16</a>)
<dt>wings of a dove - 
<dd>In scripture, doves were the sacrifices of the poor, and also a symbol of peace.<br>But they also represent fearfulness, and a desire to flee and hide from trouble (eg., <a href="isa38.htm#14">Isa 38:14</a>; <a href="hos11.htm#11">Hos 11:11</a>). When the children of Israel entered the promised land, they had no confidence in their own strength, their confidence was in the LORD. Because they trusted Him, He rewarded them royally. The timid dove was covered with His...<ul>
<li>silver - which speaks of redemption.
<li>gold - which speaks of the glory of God manifested upon them. cp. <a href="eze16.htm#6">Ezek 16:6-14</a></ul></dl>
<dt><i><b>68:14 When the Almighty scattered kings in it, it was [white] as snow in Salmon.</b></i></dt><dl>
<dt>the Almighty- HB= Shaddai, a name of God emphasizing His sufficiency...
<dd>It is He who strengthens and satisfies His people.
<dd>It is He who gives them victory over their enemies.
<dt>Salmon- a wooded hill in Samaria, the name means &quot;shade&quot; or &quot;dark,&quot; perhaps a &quot;black forest.&quot;
<dd>The sense may be...<ol type="A"><li>that the garments of the fallen kings stood out against the dark background, or...
<li>that the kings could no more stand before the Lord, than snow can endure the heat of the sun, in this normally hot region. (Note that 'white' is a supplied word.)</dl></ol><dt>&nbsp;
<dt>C. The Lord watches over Jerusalem, during Israel's dispersions, in the Times of the Gentiles, <a href="psa68.htm#15" target="lwr_lt">v.15-17</a>.
<dt><i><b>68:15 The hill of God [is as] the hill of Bashan; an high hill [as] the hill of Bashan.</b></i></dt><dl>
<dt>alternate reading [NASV]:
<dd>&quot;A mountain of God is the mountain of Bashan,
<dd>a mountain [of many] peaks is the mountain of Bashan.&quot;
<dt>Bashan - a well watered, fertile region northeast of the Sea of Galilee.
<dd>The inference, here, is that God purposes that the hill which He has chosen (ie., Jerusalem), will be strong and well nourished... even though it may not appear that way, at present.</dl>
<dt><i><b>68:16 Why leap ye, ye high hills?<br>
[this is] the hill [which] God desireth to dwell in;<br>
yea, the LORD will dwell [in it] for ever.</b></i></dt><dl>
<dt>alternate reading [NASV]:
<dd>&quot;Why do you look with envy, O mountains with [many] peaks?
<dd>At the mountain which God has desired for His abode?
<dd>Surely, the LORD will dwell [there] forever.&quot;
<dt>The many peaks are symbolic of the earth's kingdoms,
<dd>which 'leap' {HB= ratsad, watch with envious hostility} to gain dominion over Jerusalem. This is the situation, during the present &quot;Times of the Gentiles,&quot; due to God's judgment of His people. But in His time, He will establish His Kingdom as the head of the nations.
<dd>cp. <a href="psa2.htm#6">Psa 2:6</a>; <a href="isa2.htm#1">Isa 2:1-5</a></dl>
<dt><i><b>68:17 The chariots of God [are] twenty thousand, [even] thousands of angels:<br>
the Lord [is] among them, [as in] Sinai, in the holy [place].</b></i></dt><dl>
<dt>chariots... thousands... angels - cp. <a href="2kin6.htm#16">2King 6:16,17</a>; <a href="mat26.htm#53">Mat 26:53,54 </a>
<dt>The Lord has sufficient power to take dominion over the earth.
<dd>He will establish His Kingdom over the nations, when He comes to dwell among His people.</dl><dt>&nbsp;
<dt>D. The Lord ascended into Heaven, having made full provision for His own, <a href="psa68.htm#18" target="lwr_lt">v.18-20</a>.
<dt><i><b>68:18 Thou hast ascended on high,<br>thou hast led captivity captive:<br>
thou hast received gifts for men; yea, [for] the rebellious also,<br>
that the LORD God might dwell [among them].</b></i></dt><dl>
<dt>Thou hast ascended on high...- Who is being addressed?
<dd>Ascending into heaven is beyond the reach of you or me.
<dd>This is the prerogative of God... and of His Son. See <a href="pro30.htm#4">Prov 30:4</a>
<dt>Verse 18 is quoted in the NT in reference to Christ's resurrection &amp; ascension.
<dd>See <a href="eph4.htm#7">&quot;Eph 4:7-10&quot;</a> and <a href="act2.htm#34">&quot;Acts 2:34,38&quot;</a>
<dd>These themes are also contemplated in <a href="psa24.htm#1">Psalm 24</a> (also see the Book Notes, there).
<dt>What is the purpose of His 'ascending into Heaven'? -<ul>
<li>Thou hast led captivity captive.-<ul> 
<li>Christ released sinners from their bondage to sin, death and Satan. <a href="heb2.htm#14">Heb 2:14,15</a>
<li>Christ emptied 'paradise,' taking the righteous dead with Him to Heaven. <a href="luk23.htm#43">Luk 23:43</a>; <a href="heb12.htm#22">Heb 12:22,23</a></ul>
<li>Thou hast received gifts for men... for the rebellious also.- 
<br>These gifts include:<ul>
<li>the Holy Spirit. <a href="act2.htm#34">&quot;Acts 2:34,38&quot;</a>; <a href="joh14.htm#16">Joh 14:16,17</a>
<br>The formerly rebellious sinner, who places his trust in the One who died, and arose and ascended, is born again, transformed into a 'new creature,' and indwelt by God's Spirit. <a href="joh3.htm#5">Joh 3:5-7</a>; <a href="1cor6.htm#9">1Cor 6:9-11</a>; <a href="2cor5.htm#17">2Cor 5:17</a>
<li>men of God, who serve Him by caring for His Church. <a href="eph4.htm#7">&quot;Eph 4:7-16&quot;</a></ul>
<li>that the LORD God may dwell among them.-
<br>This transformation, of sinners into saints, is required before the LORD can dwell among His people (<a href="psa68.htm#17" target="lwr_lt">v.17</a>) and restore Jerusalem to its rightful status over the nations (<a href="psa68.htm#16" target="lwr_lt">v.16</a>). Through His death (by which He put away sin) and resurrection (by which He brings believers into newness of Life), the One who ascended, has accomplished the required work of salvation, for those who turn to Him in faith.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only the LORD, the everliving One, could be victorious over death. This is emphasized by the careful application of various names of God in this Psalm. He is referred to as 'God' {HB= 'El' or 'Elohim,' the Mighty One, occurs 31x}, the Lord {HB='adonai, the Master, the One with all authority, 7x}, 'Jah' {<a href="psa68.htm#4" target="lwr_lt">v.4</a>, where His eternality guarantees His everlasting covenant through the ages}, LORD {<a href="psa68.htm#16" target="lwr_lt">v.16</a>, the Everliving One dwells for ever}, and LORD God {<a href="psa68.htm#18" target="lwr_lt">v.18</a>, 'Jehoval Elohim,' ie., 'the Everliving Mighty One'}. The mighty work of salvation, by which God prepared His people for His eternal Presence, could be accomplished only by 'the Everliving Mighty One,' who died and rose and ascended victoriously into heaven.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having finished this work, He is called 'the God of our salvation,' in the following verses.</ul></dl>
<dt><i><b>68:19 Blessed [be] the Lord, [who] daily loadeth us [with benefits,<br>
even] the God of our salvation. Selah.</b></i> {<a href="eph1.htm#3">Eph 1:3</a>}<br>
<dt><i><b>68:20 [He that is] our God [is] the God of salvation;</b></i> {<a href="isa45.htm#17">Isa 45:17-22</a>}<br>
<dt><i><b>and unto GOD the Lord [belong] the issues from death.</b></i></dt><dl>
<dt>...GOD the Lord {Jehovah Adonai, 'the Everliving Master'}-
<dd>The final occurrence of the name 'Jehovah,' in this psalm, is a compound name. Not only is He victorious over death, but He has authority over death and its issues {HB= totsa'ot, extremities, outgoings, borders}. He alone has the authority to release men from the bonds of death.
<dd>cp. <a href="deu32.htm#39">Deut 32:39</a>; <a href="joh5.htm#21">Joh 5:21-29</a>; <a href="joh11.htm#25">Joh 11:25,26</a>; <a href="heb2.htm#14">Heb 2:14-15</a>; <a href="rev1.htm#18">Rev 1:18</a></dl><dt>&nbsp;
<dt>E. The Lord will judge His enemies, and restore His people, <a href="psa68.htm#21" target="lwr_lt">v.21-23</a>.
<dt><i><b>68:21 But God shall wound the head of his enemies,<br>
[and] the hairy scalp of such an one as goeth on still in his trespasses.</b></i></dt><dl>
<dt>one as goeth on still in his trespass - 
<dd>cp. <a href="ex34.htm#6">Ex 34:6,7</a>; <a href="eze18.htm#20">Eze 18:20</a>; <a href="heb2.htm#1">Heb 2:1-3</a>; <a href="2pet3.htm#3">2Pet 3:3-10</a>
<dt>the hairy...one - ultimately refers to Satan &amp; the antichrist.
<dd>A common OT word for &quot;devils&quot; (HB= sa'ir) is lit., &quot;hairy ones&quot; (cp. English 'satyr'). (eg., the word 'devils' in <a href="2chr11.htm#14">2Chr 11:14,15</a>, where Jeroboam established demonic idolatry in the northern kingdom of Israel)</dl>
<dt><i><b>68:22 The Lord said, I will bring again from Bashan,<br>
I will bring [my people] again from the depths of the sea:</b></i></dt><dl>
<dt>Bashan...- Here, this term is applied to the nations of Israel's diaspora.
<dd>Although those nations are strong and mighty, the Lord will deliver His people from their grip, and bring them back to their land.
<dd>cp. <a href="deu30.htm#1">Deut 30:1-9</a>; <a href="isa11.htm#11">Isa 11:11-16</a>; <a href="jer23.htm#5">Jer 23:5-8</a></dl>

<dt>F. The Lord will return to the Sanctuary, to dwell among His people, <a href="psa68.htm#24" target="lwr_lt">v.24-27</a>.
<dt><i><b>68:24 They have seen thy goings, O God;<br>
