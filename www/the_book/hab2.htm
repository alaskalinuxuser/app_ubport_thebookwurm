Habakkuk   2<br>1. I will stand upon my watch, and set me upon the tower, and will watch to see what he will say unto me, and what I shall answer when I am reproved.<br><a name="2">2</a>  And the LORD answered me, and said, Write the vision, and make [it] plain upon tables, that he may run that readeth it.<br><a name="3">3</a>  For the vision [is] yet for an appointed time, but at the end it shall speak, and not lie: though it tarry, wait for it; because it will surely come, it will not tarry.<br><a name="4">4</a>  Behold, his soul [which] is lifted up is not upright in him: but the just shall live by his faith.<br><a name="5">5</a>. Yea also, because he transgresseth by wine, [he is] a proud man, neither keepeth at home, who enlargeth his desire as hell, and [is] as death, and cannot be satisfied, but gathereth unto him all nations, and heapeth unto him all people:<br><a name="6">6</a>  Shall not all these take up a parable against him, and a taunting proverb against him, and say, Woe to him that increaseth [that which is] not his! how long? and to him that ladeth himself with thick clay!<br><a name="7">7</a>  Shall they not rise up suddenly that shall bite thee, and awake that shall vex thee, and thou shalt be for booties unto them?<br><a name="8">8</a>  Because thou hast spoiled many nations, all the remnant of the people shall spoil thee; because of men's blood, and [for] the violence of the land, of the city, and of all that dwell therein.<br><a name="9">9</a>  Woe to him that coveteth an evil covetousness to his house, that he may set his nest on high, that he may be delivered from the power of evil!<br><a name="10">10</a>  Thou hast consulted shame to thy house by cutting off many people, and hast sinned [against] thy soul.<br><a name="11">11</a>  For the stone shall cry out of the wall, and the beam out of the timber shall answer it.<br><a name="12">12</a>  Woe to him that buildeth a town with blood, and stablisheth a city by iniquity!<br><a name="13">13</a>  Behold, [is it] not of the LORD of hosts that the people shall labour in the very fire, and the people shall weary themselves for very vanity?<br><a name="14">14</a>  For the earth shall be filled with the knowledge of the glory of the LORD, as the waters cover the sea.<br><a name="15">15</a>. Woe unto him that giveth his neighbour drink, that puttest thy bottle to [him], and makest [him] drunken also, that thou mayest look on their nakedness!<br><a name="16">16</a>  Thou art filled with shame for glory: drink thou also, and let thy foreskin be uncovered: the cup of the LORD'S right hand shall be turned unto thee, and shameful spewing [shall be] on thy glory.<br><a name="17">17</a>  For the violence of Lebanon shall cover thee, and the spoil of beasts, [which] made them afraid, because of men's blood, and for the violence of the land, of the city, and of all that dwell therein.<br><a name="18">18</a>  What profiteth the graven image that the maker thereof hath graven it; the molten image, and a teacher of lies, that the maker of his work trusteth therein, to make dumb idols?<br><a name="19">19</a>  Woe unto him that saith to the wood, Awake; to the dumb stone, Arise, it shall teach! Behold, it [is] laid over with gold and silver, and [there is] no breath at all in the midst of it.<br><a name="20">20</a>  But the LORD [is] in his holy temple: let all the earth keep silence before him.<br><br>Go to <a href="hab3.htm#1">Habakkuk 3</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
