<b>Volume 2, Lesson 5</b><br>
by C.I. Scofield
<h2>Christ Was &quot;Made...&quot;</h2></center>
<p>Nothing is more helpful to the believer who seeks complete rest in the work of Christ that to look at the things -- partly tragic, and terrible -- partly exalted and mighty -- which Christ has been &quot;made.&quot;</p>
<p>It is very beautiful and instructive to see that our blessed Lord always took the place of perfect submission. He &quot;made Himself of no reputation&quot; (<a href="php2.htm#7">Philippians 2:7</a>) and there stopped. All else that He was and is, the Father &quot;made&quot; Him. He would not permit either Satan or man to confer distinction upon Him (<a href="mat4.htm#8">Matthew 4:8-10</a>; <a href="joh6.htm#15">John 6:15</a>), but found all His delight in simply doing His Father's will -- equally willing to be &quot;made a curse&quot; (<a href="gal3.htm#13">Galatians 3:13</a>), or &quot;High Priest&quot; (<a href="heb6.htm#20">Hebrews 6:20</a>).</p>

<li><a href="php2.htm#7">Philippians 2:7</a> - &quot;Made in the likeness of men&quot;</ul><b>
<li>He was made sin</b><ul>
<li><a href="2cor5.htm#21">2Corinthians 5:21</a> - &quot;Made Him to be sin for us&quot;
<li><a href="isa53.htm#6">Isaiah 53:6-10</a> - &quot;The Lord hath laid on Him the iniquity of us all... it please the Lord to bruise Him&quot;

<li><a href="luk21.htm#15">Luke 21:15</a> - &quot;I will give you a mouth and wisdom&quot;
<li><a href="act6.htm#10">Acts 6:10</a> - &quot;The wisdom... by which He spake&quot;</ul><b>

<li><a href="2cor5.htm#21">2Corinthians 5:21</a> - &quot;We might be made the righteousness of God in Him&quot;</ul><b>
<li>He was made our sanctification</b><ul>
<li><a href="heb10.htm#10">Hebrews 10:10</a> - &quot;We are sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ&quot;</ul><b>
<li>He was made our redemption</b><ul>
<li><a href="1pet1.htm#18">1Peter 1:18</a> - &quot;Redeemed... with the precious blood of Christ&quot;</ul><b>
<li>He was made better</b><ul>
<li><a href="heb1.htm#4">Hebrews 1:4</a> - &quot;Made... better than the angels&quot;
<li><a href="heb7.htm#26">Hebrews 7:26</a> - &quot;Made higher than the heavens&quot;
<li><a href="1pet2.htm#7">1Peter 2:7</a> - &quot;Made the head of the corner&quot;</ul><b>
<li>He was made High Priest</b><ul>
<li><a href="heb6.htm#20">Hebrews 6:20</a> - &quot;Made and High Priest for ever&quot; (see <a href="heb5.htm#5">Hebrews 5:5,6</a></ul><b>
<li>He was made surety (one who is responsible for another)</b><ul>
<li><a href="heb7.htm#22">Hebrews 7:22</a> - &quot;Made a surety of a better testament&quot; (see <a href="gen15.htm#8">Genesis 15:8-15</a>)
<li><a href="heb8.htm#12">Hebrews 8:12,13</a> - &quot;Their sins... will I remember no more&quot;<br>
This defines the new covenant where Christ is God's surety. We sometimes think of Christ as our surety to the Father, as the old hymn says: &quot;Before the throne my surety stands.&quot; In so thinking we lose the blessed truth, which is, that Christ is God's surety <i><b>to us</b></i>, that He will faithfully keep the New Covenant.</ul></ol>
