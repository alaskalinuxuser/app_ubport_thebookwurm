Amos   6<br>1. Woe to them [that are] at ease in Zion, and trust in the mountain of Samaria, [which are] named chief of the nations, to whom the house of Israel came!<br><a name="2">2</a>  Pass ye unto Calneh, and see; and from thence go ye to Hamath the great: then go down to Gath of the Philistines: [be they] better than these kingdoms? or their border greater than your border?<br><a name="3">3</a>  Ye that put far away the evil day, and cause the seat of violence to come near;<br><a name="4">4</a>  That lie upon beds of ivory, and stretch themselves upon their couches, and eat the lambs out of the flock, and the calves out of the midst of the stall;<br><a name="5">5</a>  That chant to the sound of the viol, [and] invent to themselves instruments of musick, like David;<br><a name="6">6</a>  That drink wine in bowls, and anoint themselves with the chief ointments: but they are not grieved for the affliction of Joseph.<br><a name="7">7</a>  Therefore now shall they go captive with the first that go captive, and the banquet of them that stretched themselves shall be removed.<br><a name="8">8</a>. The Lord GOD hath sworn by himself, saith the LORD the God of hosts, I abhor the excellency of Jacob, and hate his palaces: therefore will I deliver up the city with all that is therein.<br><a name="9">9</a>  And it shall come to pass, if there remain ten men in one house, that they shall die.<br><a name="10">10</a>  And a man's uncle shall take him up, and he that burneth him, to bring out the bones out of the house, and shall say unto him that [is] by the sides of the house, [Is there] yet [any] with thee? and he shall say, No. Then shall he say, Hold thy tongue: for we may not make mention of the name of the LORD.<br><a name="11">11</a>  For, behold, the LORD commandeth, and he will smite the great house with breaches, and the little house with clefts.<br><a name="12">12</a>  Shall horses run upon the rock? will [one] plow [there] with oxen? for ye have turned judgment into gall, and the fruit of righteousness into hemlock:<br><a name="13">13</a>  Ye which rejoice in a thing of nought, which say, Have we not taken to us horns by our own strength?<br><a name="14">14</a>  But, behold, I will raise up against you a nation, O house of Israel, saith the LORD the God of hosts; and they shall afflict you from the entering in of Hemath unto the river of the wilderness.<br><br>Go to <a href="amos7.htm#1">Amos 7</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
