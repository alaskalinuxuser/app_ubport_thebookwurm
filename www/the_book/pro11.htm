Proverbs  11<br>1. A false balance [is] abomination to the LORD: but a just weight [is] his delight.<br><a name="2">2</a>. [When] pride cometh, then cometh shame: but with the lowly [is] wisdom.<br><a name="3">3</a>. The integrity of the upright shall guide them: but the perverseness of transgressors shall destroy them.<br><a name="4">4</a>. Riches profit not in the day of wrath: but righteousness delivereth from death.<br><a name="5">5</a>. The righteousness of the perfect shall direct his way: but the wicked shall fall by his own wickedness.<br><a name="6">6</a>  The righteousness of the upright shall deliver them: but transgressors shall be taken in [their own] naughtiness.<br><a name="7">7</a>. When a wicked man dieth, [his] expectation shall perish: and the hope of unjust [men] perisheth.<br><a name="8">8</a>. The righteous is delivered out of trouble, and the wicked cometh in his stead.<br><a name="9">9</a>. An hypocrite with [his] mouth destroyeth his neighbour: but through knowledge shall the just be delivered.<br><a name="10">10</a>. When it goeth well with the righteous, the city rejoiceth: and when the wicked perish, [there is] shouting.<br><a name="11">11</a>  By the blessing of the upright the city is exalted: but it is overthrown by the mouth of the wicked.<br><a name="12">12</a>. He that is void of wisdom despiseth his neighbour: but a man of understanding holdeth his peace.<br><a name="13">13</a>  A talebearer revealeth secrets: but he that is of a faithful spirit concealeth the matter.<br><a name="14">14</a>. Where no counsel [is], the people fall: but in the multitude of counsellors [there is] safety.<br><a name="15">15</a>. He that is surety for a stranger shall smart [for it]: and he that hateth suretiship is sure.<br><a name="16">16</a>. A gracious woman retaineth honour: and strong [men] retain riches.<br><a name="17">17</a>. The merciful man doeth good to his own soul: but [he that is] cruel troubleth his own flesh.<br><a name="18">18</a>. The wicked worketh a deceitful work: but to him that soweth righteousness [shall be] a sure reward.<br><a name="19">19</a>. As righteousness [tendeth] to life: so he that pursueth evil [pursueth it] to his own death.<br><a name="20">20</a>. They that are of a froward heart [are] abomination to the LORD: but [such as are] upright in [their] way [are] his delight.<br><a name="21">21</a>. [Though] hand [join] in hand, the wicked shall not be unpunished: but the seed of the righteous shall be delivered.<br><a name="22">22</a>. [As] a jewel of gold in a swine's snout, [so is] a fair woman which is without discretion.<br><a name="23">23</a>. The desire of the righteous [is] only good: [but] the expectation of the wicked [is] wrath.<br><a name="24">24</a>. There is that scattereth, and yet increaseth; and [there is] that withholdeth more than is meet, but [it tendeth] to poverty.<br><a name="25">25</a>. The liberal soul shall be made fat: and he that watereth shall be watered also himself.<br><a name="26">26</a>. He that withholdeth corn, the people shall curse him: but blessing [shall be] upon the head of him that selleth [it].<br><a name="27">27</a>. He that diligently seeketh good procureth favour: but he that seeketh mischief, it shall come unto him.<br><a name="28">28</a>. He that trusteth in his riches shall fall: but the righteous shall flourish as a branch.<br><a name="29">29</a>. He that troubleth his own house shall inherit the wind: and the fool [shall be] servant to the wise of heart.<br><a name="30">30</a>. The fruit of the righteous [is] a tree of life; and he that winneth souls [is] wise.<br><a name="31">31</a>. Behold, the righteous shall be recompensed in the earth: much more the wicked and the sinner.<br><br>Go to <a href="pro12.htm#1">Proverbs 12</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
