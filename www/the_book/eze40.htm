Ezekiel  40<br>1. In the five and twentieth year of our captivity, in the beginning of the year, in the tenth [day] of the month, in the fourteenth year after that the city was smitten, in the selfsame day the hand of the LORD was upon me, and brought me thither.<br><a name="2">2</a>  In the visions of God brought he me into the land of Israel, and set me upon a very high mountain, by which [was] as the frame of a city on the south.<br><a name="3">3</a>  And he brought me thither, and, behold, [there was] a man, whose appearance [was] like the appearance of brass, with a line of flax in his hand, and a measuring reed; and he stood in the gate.<br><a name="4">4</a>  And the man said unto me, Son of man, behold with thine eyes, and hear with thine ears, and set thine heart upon all that I shall shew thee; for to the intent that I might shew [them] unto thee [art] thou brought hither: declare all that thou seest to the house of Israel.<br><a name="5">5</a>. And behold a wall on the outside of the house round about, and in the man's hand a measuring reed of six cubits [long] by the cubit and an hand breadth: so he measured the breadth of the building, one reed; and the height, one reed.<br><a name="6">6</a>  Then came he unto the gate which looketh toward the east, and went up the stairs thereof, and measured the threshold of the gate, [which was] one reed broad; and the other threshold [of the gate, which was] one reed broad.<br><a name="7">7</a>  And [every] little chamber [was] one reed long, and one reed broad; and between the little chambers [were] five cubits; and the threshold of the gate by the porch of the gate within [was] one reed.<br><a name="8">8</a>  He measured also the porch of the gate within, one reed.<br><a name="9">9</a>  Then measured he the porch of the gate, eight cubits; and the posts thereof, two cubits; and the porch of the gate [was] inward.<br><a name="10">10</a>  And the little chambers of the gate eastward [were] three on this side, and three on that side; they three [were] of one measure: and the posts had one measure on this side and on that side.<br><a name="11">11</a>  And he measured the breadth of the entry of the gate, ten cubits; [and] the length of the gate, thirteen cubits.<br><a name="12">12</a>  The space also before the little chambers [was] one cubit [on this side], and the space [was] one cubit on that side: and the little chambers [were] six cubits on this side, and six cubits on that side.<br><a name="13">13</a>  He measured then the gate from the roof of [one] little chamber to the roof of another: the breadth [was] five and twenty cubits, door against door.<br><a name="14">14</a>  He made also posts of threescore cubits, even unto the post of the court round about the gate.<br><a name="15">15</a>  And from the face of the gate of the entrance unto the face of the porch of the inner gate [were] fifty cubits.<br><a name="16">16</a>  And [there were] narrow windows to the little chambers, and to their posts within the gate round about, and likewise to the arches: and windows [were] round about inward: and upon [each] post [were] palm trees.<br><a name="17">17</a>  Then brought he me into the outward court, and, lo, [there were] chambers, and a pavement made for the court round about: thirty chambers [were] upon the pavement.<br><a name="18">18</a>  And the pavement by the side of the gates over against the length of the gates [was] the lower pavement.<br><a name="19">19</a>  Then he measured the breadth from the forefront of the lower gate unto the forefront of the inner court without, an hundred cubits eastward and northward.<br><a name="20">20</a>  And the gate of the outward court that looked toward the north, he measured the length thereof, and the breadth thereof.<br><a name="21">21</a>  And the little chambers thereof [were] three on this side and three on that side; and the posts thereof and the arches thereof were after the measure of the first gate: the length thereof [was] fifty cubits, and the breadth five and twenty cubits.<br><a name="22">22</a>  And their windows, and their arches, and their palm trees, [were] after the measure of the gate that looketh toward the east; and they went up unto it by seven steps; and the arches thereof [were] before them.<br><a name="23">23</a>  And the gate of the inner court [was] over against the gate toward the north, and toward the east; and he measured from gate to gate an hundred cubits.<br><a name="24">24</a>  After that he brought me toward the south, and behold a gate toward the south: and he measured the posts thereof and the arches thereof according to these measures.<br><a name="25">25</a>  And [there were] windows in it and in the arches thereof round about, like those windows: the length [was] fifty cubits, and the breadth five and twenty cubits.<br><a name="26">26</a>  And [there were] seven steps to go up to it, and the arches thereof [were] before them: and it had palm trees, one on this side, and another on that side, upon the posts thereof.<br><a name="27">27</a>. And [there was] a gate in the inner court toward the south: and he measured from gate to gate toward the south an hundred cubits.<br><a name="28">28</a>  And he brought me to the inner court by the south gate: and he measured the south gate according to these measures;<br><a name="29">29</a>  And the little chambers thereof, and the posts thereof, and the arches thereof, according to these measures: and [there were] windows in it and in the arches thereof round about: [it was] fifty cubits long, and five and twenty cubits broad.<br><a name="30">30</a>  And the arches round about [were] five and twenty cubits long, and five cubits broad.<br><a name="31">31</a>  And the arches thereof [were] toward the utter court; and palm trees [were] upon the posts thereof: and the going up to it [had] eight steps.<br><a name="32">32</a>  And he brought me into the inner court toward the east: and he measured the gate according to these measures.<br><a name="33">33</a>  And the little chambers thereof, and the posts thereof, and the arches thereof, [were] according to these measures: and [there were] windows therein and in the arches thereof round about: [it was] fifty cubits long, and five and twenty cubits broad.<br><a name="34">34</a>  And the arches thereof [were] toward the outward court; and palm trees [were] upon the posts thereof, on this side, and on that side: and the going up to it [had] eight steps.<br><a name="35">35</a>  And he brought me to the north gate, and measured [it] according to these measures;<br><a name="36">36</a>  The little chambers thereof, the posts thereof, and the arches thereof, and the windows to it round about: the length [was] fifty cubits, and the breadth five and twenty cubits.<br><a name="37">37</a>  And the posts thereof [were] toward the utter court; and palm trees [were] upon the posts thereof, on this side, and on that side: and the going up to it [had] eight steps.<br><a name="38">38</a>  And the chambers and the entries thereof [were] by the posts of the gates, where they washed the burnt offering.<br><a name="39">39</a>. And in the porch of the gate [were] two tables on this side, and two tables on that side, to slay thereon the burnt offering and the sin offering and the trespass offering.<br><a name="40">40</a>  And at the side without, as one goeth up to the entry of the north gate, [were] two tables; and on the other side, which [was] at the porch of the gate, [were] two tables.<br><a name="41">41</a>  Four tables [were] on this side, and four tables on that side, by the side of the gate; eight tables, whereupon they slew [their sacrifices].<br><a name="42">42</a>  And the four tables [were] of hewn stone for the burnt offering, of a cubit and an half long, and a cubit and an half broad, and one cubit high: whereupon also they laid the instruments wherewith they slew the burnt offering and the sacrifice.<br><a name="43">43</a>  And within [were] hooks, an hand broad, fastened round about: and upon the tables [was] the flesh of the offering.<br><a name="44">44</a>  And without the inner gate [were] the chambers of the singers in the inner court, which [was] at the side of the north gate; and their prospect [was] toward the south: one at the side of the east gate [having] the prospect toward the north.<br><a name="45">45</a>  And he said unto me, This chamber, whose prospect [is] toward the south, [is] for the priests, the keepers of the charge of the house.<br><a name="46">46</a>  And the chamber whose prospect [is] toward the north [is] for the priests, the keepers of the charge of the altar: these [are] the sons of Zadok among the sons of Levi, which come near to the LORD to minister unto him.<br><a name="47">47</a>  So he measured the court, an hundred cubits long, and an hundred cubits broad, foursquare; and the altar [that was] before the house.<br><a name="48">48</a>  And he brought me to the porch of the house, and measured [each] post of the porch, five cubits on this side, and five cubits on that side: and the breadth of the gate [was] three cubits on this side, and three cubits on that side.<br><a name="49">49</a>  The length of the porch [was] twenty cubits, and the breadth eleven cubits; and [he brought me] by the steps whereby they went up to it: and [there were] pillars by the posts, one on this side, and another on that side.<br><br>Go to <a href="eze41.htm#1">Ezekiel 41</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
