Psalms  92<br>1. A Psalm [or] Song for the sabbath day. [It is a] good [thing] to give thanks unto the LORD, and to sing praises unto thy name, O most High:<br><a name="2">2</a>  To shew forth thy lovingkindness in the morning, and thy faithfulness every night,<br><a name="3">3</a>  Upon an instrument of ten strings, and upon the psaltery; upon the harp with a solemn sound.<br><a name="4">4</a>  For thou, LORD, hast made me glad through thy work: I will triumph in the works of thy hands.<br><a name="5">5</a>  O LORD, how great are thy works! [and] thy thoughts are very deep.<br><a name="6">6</a>  A brutish man knoweth not; neither doth a fool understand this.<br><a name="7">7</a>. When the wicked spring as the grass, and when all the workers of iniquity do flourish; [it is] that they shall be destroyed for ever:<br><a name="8">8</a>  But thou, LORD, [art most] high for evermore.<br><a name="9">9</a>  For, lo, thine enemies, O LORD, for, lo, thine enemies shall perish; all the workers of iniquity shall be scattered.<br><a name="10">10</a>  But my horn shalt thou exalt like [the horn of] an unicorn: I shall be anointed with fresh oil.<br><a name="11">11</a>  Mine eye also shall see [my desire] on mine enemies, [and] mine ears shall hear [my desire] of the wicked that rise up against me.<br><a name="12">12</a>  The righteous shall flourish like the palm tree: he shall grow like a cedar in Lebanon.<br><a name="13">13</a>  Those that be planted in the house of the LORD shall flourish in the courts of our God.<br><a name="14">14</a>  They shall still bring forth fruit in old age; they shall be fat and flourishing;<br><a name="15">15</a>  To shew that the LORD [is] upright: [he is] my rock, and [there is] no unrighteousness in him.<br><br>Go to <a href="psa93.htm#1">Psalm 93</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
