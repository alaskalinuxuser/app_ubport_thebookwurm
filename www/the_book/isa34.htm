Isaiah  34<br> 1. Come near, ye nations, to hear; and hearken, ye people: let the earth hear, and all that is therein; the world, and all things that come forth of it.<br><a name="2">2</a>  For the indignation of the LORD [is] upon all nations, and [his] fury upon all their armies: he hath utterly destroyed them, he hath delivered them to the slaughter.<br><a name="3">3</a>  Their slain also shall be cast out, and their stink shall come up out of their carcases, and the mountains shall be melted with their blood.<br><a name="4">4</a>  And all the host of heaven shall be dissolved, and the heavens shall be rolled together as a scroll: and all their host shall fall down, as the leaf falleth off from the vine, and as a falling [fig] from the fig tree.<br><a name="5">5</a>  For my sword shall be bathed in heaven: behold, it shall come down upon Idumea, and upon the people of my curse, to judgment.<br><a name="6">6</a>  The sword of the LORD is filled with blood, it is made fat with fatness, [and] with the blood of lambs and goats, with the fat of the kidneys of rams: for the LORD hath a sacrifice in Bozrah, and a great slaughter in the land of Idumea.<br><a name="7">7</a>  And the unicorns shall come down with them, and the bullocks with the bulls; and their land shall be soaked with blood, and their dust made fat with fatness.<br><a name="8">8</a>  For [it is] the day of the LORD'S vengeance, [and] the year of recompences for the controversy of Zion.<br><a name="9">9</a>. And the streams thereof shall be turned into pitch, and the dust thereof into brimstone, and the land thereof shall become burning pitch.<br><a name="10">10</a>  It shall not be quenched night nor day; the smoke thereof shall go up for ever: from generation to generation it shall lie waste; none shall pass through it for ever and ever.<br><a name="11">11</a>  But the cormorant and the bittern shall possess it; the owl also and the raven shall dwell in it: and he shall stretch out upon it the line of confusion, and the stones of emptiness.<br><a name="12">12</a>  They shall call the nobles thereof to the kingdom, but none [shall be] there, and all her princes shall be nothing.<br><a name="13">13</a>  And thorns shall come up in her palaces, nettles and brambles in the fortresses thereof: and it shall be an habitation of dragons, [and] a court for owls.<br><a name="14">14</a>  The wild beasts of the desert shall also meet with the wild beasts of the island, and the satyr shall cry to his fellow; the screech owl also shall rest there, and find for herself a place of rest.<br><a name="15">15</a>  There shall the great owl make her nest, and lay, and hatch, and gather under her shadow: there shall the vultures also be gathered, every one with her mate.<br><a name="16">16</a>  Seek ye out of the book of the LORD, and read: no one of these shall fail, none shall want her mate: for my mouth it hath commanded, and his spirit it hath gathered them.<br><a name="17">17</a>  And he hath cast the lot for them, and his hand hath divided it unto them by line: they shall possess it for ever, from generation to generation shall they dwell therein.<br><br>Go to <a href="isa35.htm#1">Isaiah 35</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
