Galatians   6<br>1. Brethren, if a man be overtaken in a fault, ye which are spiritual, restore such an one in the spirit of meekness; considering thyself, lest thou also be tempted.<br><a name="2">2</a>  Bear ye one another's burdens, and so fulfil the law of Christ.<br><a name="3">3</a>  For if a man think himself to be something, when he is nothing, he deceiveth himself.<br><a name="4">4</a>  But let every man prove his own work, and then shall he have rejoicing in himself alone, and not in another.<br><a name="5">5</a>  For every man shall bear his own burden.<br><a name="6">6</a>  Let him that is taught in the word communicate unto him that teacheth in all good things.<br><a name="7">7</a>  Be not deceived; God is not mocked: for whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap.<br><a name="8">8</a>  For he that soweth to his flesh shall of the flesh reap corruption; but he that soweth to the Spirit shall of the Spirit reap life everlasting.<br><a name="9">9</a>  And let us not be weary in well doing: for in due season we shall reap, if we faint not.<br><a name="10">10</a>  As we have therefore opportunity, let us do good unto all [men], especially unto them who are of the household of faith.<br><a name="11">11</a>. Ye see how large a letter I have written unto you with mine own hand.<br><a name="12">12</a>  As many as desire to make a fair shew in the flesh, they constrain you to be circumcised; only lest they should suffer persecution for the cross of Christ.<br><a name="13">13</a>  For neither they themselves who are circumcised keep the law; but desire to have you circumcised, that they may glory in your flesh.<br><a name="14">14</a>  But God forbid that I should glory, save in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom the world is crucified unto me, and I unto the world.<br><a name="15">15</a>  For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision availeth any thing, nor uncircumcision, but a new creature.<br><a name="16">16</a>  And as many as walk according to this rule, peace [be] on them, and mercy, and upon the Israel of God.<br><a name="17">17</a>  From henceforth let no man trouble me: for I bear in my body the marks of the Lord Jesus.<br><a name="18">18</a>  Brethren, the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ [be] with your spirit.
