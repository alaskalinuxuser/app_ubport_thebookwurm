Psalms  57<br> 1. To the chief Musician, Altaschith, Michtam of David, when he fled from Saul in the cave. Be merciful unto me, O God, be merciful unto me: for my soul trusteth in thee: yea, in the shadow of thy wings will I make my refuge, until [these] calamities be overpast.<br><a name="2">2</a>  I will cry unto God most high; unto God that performeth [all things] for me.<br><a name="3">3</a>  He shall send from heaven, and save me [from] the reproach of him that would swallow me up. Selah. God shall send forth his mercy and his truth.<br><a name="4">4</a>  My soul [is] among lions: [and] I lie [even among] them that are set on fire, [even] the sons of men, whose teeth [are] spears and arrows, and their tongue a sharp sword.<br><a name="5">5</a>  Be thou exalted, O God, above the heavens; [let] thy glory [be] above all the earth.<br><a name="6">6</a>  They have prepared a net for my steps; my soul is bowed down: they have digged a pit before me, into the midst whereof they are fallen [themselves]. Selah.<br><a name="7">7</a>. My heart is fixed, O God, my heart is fixed: I will sing and give praise.<br><a name="8">8</a>  Awake up, my glory; awake, psaltery and harp: I [myself] will awake early.<br><a name="9">9</a>  I will praise thee, O Lord, among the people: I will sing unto thee among the nations.<br><a name="10">10</a>  For thy mercy [is] great unto the heavens, and thy truth unto the clouds.<br><a name="11">11</a>  Be thou exalted, O God, above the heavens: [let] thy glory [be] above all the earth.<br><br>Go to <a href="psa58.htm#1">Psalm 58</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
