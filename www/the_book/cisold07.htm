<b>Volume 4, Lesson 7</b><br>
by C.I. Scofield
<h2>The Chosen People Redeemed, Part I</h2>
<h3><i>Israel in Egypt (Exodus 1)</i></h3></center>
<p>The chosen people were in Egypt partly as the result of the envy of Joseph's brethren, and partly because of famine in the land. It seemed to be an advantage to travel to Egypt. The spiritual parallel is the constant turning of the Church to the world for money, influence, and methods.</p>

<li>The permissive and the directive will of God</b><ul>
<li><a href="gen26.htm#2">Genesis 26:2,3</a> -- &quot;Go not down into Egypt&quot;
<li><a href="gen46.htm#3">Genesis 46:3,4</a> -- &quot;Fear not to go down into Egypt&quot;</ul>
<p>God's best is in His own directive will for us. Often, He permits His people to do things in other ways, only to find out through sufferings that His will was best. Other examples of God's permissive will include His assent to the sending of spies (<a href="deu1.htm#21">Deuteronomy 1:21</a>; <a href="num13.htm#1">Numbers 13:1-3</a>) and the choice of Saul as king (<a href="1sam8.htm#7">1Samuel 8:7-9</a>).</p><b>
<li>Egypt, a picture of the world, was no place for the people of God</b><ul>
<li><a href="gen12.htm#10">Genesis 12:10</a> -- &quot;Famine... Abram went down into Egypt.&quot; Egypt with her wealth in corn, is always a temptation (see <a href="gen42.htm#1">Genesis 42:1,2</a>; <a href="ex16.htm#2">Exodus 16:2,3</a>).
<li><a href="ex1.htm#7">Exodus 1:7-14</a> -- &quot;And they made their lives bitter with hard bondage.&quot; Egypt (the world) brings Israel into bondage.</ul><b>
<li>Humanity is in bondage</b><ol type="1">

<li><a href="rom6.htm#16">Romans 6:16</a> -- &quot;Know ye not, that to whom ye yield&quot;

<li>To habit<ul>
<li><a href="jer13.htm#23">Jeremiah 13:23</a> -- &quot;Accustomed to do evil&quot;</ul>
<li>To self<ul>
<li><a href="rom7.htm#14">Romans 7:14</a> -- &quot;Sold under sin.&quot; Here, sin stands for the old nature.</ul>
<li>To Satan<ul>
<li><a href="rev13.htm#4">Revelation 13:4</a> -- &quot;And they worshipped the dragon&quot;
