Psalms  68<br> 1. To the chief Musician, A Psalm [or] Song of David. Let God arise, let his enemies be scattered: let them also that hate him flee before him.<br><a name="2">2</a>  As smoke is driven away, [so] drive [them] away: as wax melteth before the fire, [so] let the wicked perish at the presence of God.<br><a name="3">3</a>  But let the righteous be glad; let them rejoice before God: yea, let them exceedingly rejoice.<br><a name="4">4</a>  Sing unto God, sing praises to his name: extol him that rideth upon the heavens by his name JAH, and rejoice before him.<br><a name="5">5</a>  A father of the fatherless, and a judge of the widows, [is] God in his holy habitation.<br><a name="6">6</a>  God setteth the solitary in families: he bringeth out those which are bound with chains: but the rebellious dwell in a dry [land].<br><a name="7">7</a>. O God, when thou wentest forth before thy people, when thou didst march through the wilderness; Selah:<br><a name="8">8</a>  The earth shook, the heavens also dropped at the presence of God: [even] Sinai itself [was moved] at the presence of God, the God of Israel.<br><a name="9">9</a>  Thou, O God, didst send a plentiful rain, whereby thou didst confirm thine inheritance, when it was weary.<br><a name="10">10</a>  Thy congregation hath dwelt therein: thou, O God, hast prepared of thy goodness for the poor.<br><a name="11">11</a>  The Lord gave the word: great [was] the company of those that published [it].<br><a name="12">12</a>  Kings of armies did flee apace: and she that tarried at home divided the spoil.<br><a name="13">13</a>  Though ye have lien among the pots, [yet shall ye be as] the wings of a dove covered with silver, and her feathers with yellow gold.<br><a name="14">14</a>  When the Almighty scattered kings in it, it was [white] as snow in Salmon.<br><a name="15">15</a>. The hill of God [is as] the hill of Bashan; an high hill [as] the hill of Bashan.<br><a name="16">16</a>  Why leap ye, ye high hills? [this is] the hill [which] God desireth to dwell in; yea, the LORD will dwell [in it] for ever.<br><a name="17">17</a>  The chariots of God [are] twenty thousand, [even] thousands of angels: the Lord [is] among them, [as in] Sinai, in the holy [place].<br><a name="18">18</a>  Thou hast ascended on high, thou hast led captivity captive: thou hast received gifts for men; yea, [for] the rebellious also, that the LORD God might dwell [among them].<br><a name="19">19</a>  Blessed [be] the Lord, [who] daily loadeth us [with benefits, even] the God of our salvation. Selah.<br><a name="20">20</a>  [He that is] our God [is] the God of salvation; and unto GOD the Lord [belong] the issues from death.<br><a name="21">21</a>  But God shall wound the head of his enemies, [and] the hairy scalp of such an one as goeth on still in his trespasses.<br><a name="22">22</a>. The Lord said, I will bring again from Bashan, I will bring [my people] again from the depths of the sea:<br><a name="23">23</a>  That thy foot may be dipped in the blood of [thine] enemies, [and] the tongue of thy dogs in the same.<br><a name="24">24</a>  They have seen thy goings, O God; [even] the goings of my God, my King, in the sanctuary.<br><a name="25">25</a>  The singers went before, the players on instruments [followed] after; among [them were] the damsels playing with timbrels.<br><a name="26">26</a>  Bless ye God in the congregations, [even] the Lord, from the fountain of Israel.<br><a name="27">27</a>  There [is] little Benjamin [with] their ruler, the princes of Judah [and] their council, the princes of Zebulun, [and] the princes of Naphtali.<br><a name="28">28</a>  Thy God hath commanded thy strength: strengthen, O God, that which thou hast wrought for us.<br><a name="29">29</a>  Because of thy temple at Jerusalem shall kings bring presents unto thee.<br><a name="30">30</a>  Rebuke the company of spearmen, the multitude of the bulls, with the calves of the people, [till every one] submit himself with pieces of silver: scatter thou the people [that] delight in war.<br><a name="31">31</a>  Princes shall come out of Egypt; Ethiopia shall soon stretch out her hands unto God.<br><a name="32">32</a>. Sing unto God, ye kingdoms of the earth; O sing praises unto the Lord; Selah:<br><a name="33">33</a>  To him that rideth upon the heavens of heavens, [which were] of old; lo, he doth send out his voice, [and that] a mighty voice.<br><a name="34">34</a>  Ascribe ye strength unto God: his excellency [is] over Israel, and his strength [is] in the clouds.<br><a name="35">35</a>  O God, [thou art] terrible out of thy holy places: the God of Israel [is] he that giveth strength and power unto [his] people.
