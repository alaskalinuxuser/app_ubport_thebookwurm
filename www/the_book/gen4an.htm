<dt><b><i>4:1 And Adam knew Eve his wife; and she conceived, <br>
and bare Cain, and said, I have gotten a man from the LORD.<br>
4:2 And she again bare his brother Abel. <br>
And Abel was a keeper of sheep, but Cain was a tiller of the ground.</i></b></dt><dl>
<dt>Adam knew Eve his wife...- In the OT, this formula refers to sexual intimacy.
<dd>Cain and Abel may have been twins, since this formula is not stated separately for each birth, but occurs prior to the birth of their third son in <a href="gen4.htm#25" target="lwr_lt">v.25</a>.
<dd>These boys will become very different men. But note that their differences cannot be blamed on genetics, upbringing or environment.
<dt>Cain- means 'acquisition.' ''I have gotten me a man from the Lord.''<ul>
<li>Eve apparently thought this child was the fulfillment of the Lord's promise in <a href="gen3.htm#15">3:15</a>.<dd>
But he, as a son of Adam, could not be the promised seed. <br>
Nor did he enter the world having a share in Adam's salvation by faith (<a href="gen3.htm#20">3:20,21</a>), since that was a spiritual  gift from God.<br>
''Whatever was natural, Adam, could in the way of nature, communicate to his children; but nothing more. Since he as the father was in a condition of ruin, his son could only be in the same. As is the begetter, so are they also who are begotten of him.'' [CHM] cp. <a href="joh3.htm#6">Joh 3:6,7</a>; <a href="1cor15.htm#45">1Cor 15:45-48</a><dt>
<li>Cain becomes a 'type' (or picture) of the man of the earth.</ul>
<dt>Abel- means 'exhalation,' 'that which ascends,' 'a vapor.' 
<dd>Abel, through his approach to God, becomes a type of the spiritual man.

<b><i>4:3 And in process of time it came to pass, <br>
that Cain brought of the fruit of the ground an offering unto the LORD.<br>
4:4 And Abel, he also brought of the firstlings of his flock and of the fat thereof. <br>
And the LORD had respect unto Abel and to his offering:<br>
4:5 But unto Cain and to his offering he had not respect. <br>
And Cain was very wroth </b></i>{ie., angry}<i><b>, and his countenance fell.<br>
4:6 And the LORD said unto Cain, Why art thou wroth? and why is thy countenance fallen?<br>
4:7 If thou doest well, shalt thou not be accepted? <br>
and if thou doest not well, sin lieth at the door. <br>
And unto thee [shall be] his desire, and thou shalt rule over him.</i></b></dt><dl>
<dt>Cain was religious. He approached God, but on his own terms.
<dd>He had an inadequate sense of sin and an inadequate sense of need for atonement.
<dt>Cain's offering was not accepted because it represented -<ol type="A">
<li>his own works- A sinner's toil cannot remove the stain of sin. <br>The toil of Adam &amp; Eve in this regard had been in vain (<a href="gen3.htm#7">3:7</a>).
<li>the fruit of a cursed earth (<a href="gen3.htm#17">3:17-19</a>)- which bore testimony to the penalty due sin,<br>could not set aside that penalty (even though that fruit was carefully cultivated).</ol>
<dt>Abel's offering was accepted because -<ol type="A">
<li>it was offered 'by faith.' <a href="heb11.htm#4">Heb 11:4</a>; cp. <a href="rom4.htm#5">Rom 4:5</a>; <a href="rom5.htm#1">5:1</a>; <a href="eph2.htm#8">Eph 2:8,9</a><br>
Faith rests upon the Word of God (<a href="rom10.htm#17">Rom 10:17</a>; <a href="heb11.htm#1">Heb 11:1</a>). What Word did he believe?<ol type="a">
<li>God had told Adam &amp; Eve that the consequence of sin is death. <a href="gen2.htm#16">2:16,17</a><br>
Abel's sacrifice expressed his confession of sin and the penalty which he deserved.
<li>God had provided covering for the sin of Adam &amp; Eve by blood sacrifice (<a href="gen3.htm#21">3:21</a>), thus foreshadowing His provision of a Savior who would deliver men from the power of sin and Satan (<a href="gen3.htm#15">3:15,20</a>).<br>
Abel's sacrifice expressed his faith in God's promise of Salvation.</ol>
<li>it was a 'more excellent sacrifice' (<a href="heb11.htm#4">Heb 11:4</a>) because <br>
it spoke of the Lamb of God, and His substitutionary sacrifice in behalf of the sinner. <br>cp. <a href="gen22.htm#8">Gen 22:8</a>; <a href="joh1.htm#29">Joh 1:29</a>; <a href="heb9.htm#22">Heb 9:22</a>; <a href="1pet1.htm#18">1Pet 1:18-20</a></ol>
<dt>Cain was angry... - 
<dd>The requirement for blood sacrifice offends the flesh because it demands its death.
<dd>The offer of justification, by faith alone in the Lamb provided by God alone, offends the flesh because it makes God everything and man nothing. cp. <a href="rom6.htm#23">Rom 6:23</a>; <a href="rom10.htm#3">10:3</a>
<dd>Cain's faith was in his own concept of what constituted an acceptable approach to God. cp. <a href="pro16.htm#25">Prov 16:25</a>
<dt>The difference between Cain &amp; Able is defined simply by their sacrifices-
<dd>Able offered in self-condemnation, with faith in and submission to God's Word.
<dd>Cain offered in self-righteousness, self-deception and pride.  cp. <a href="2cor11.htm#3">2Cor 11:3,4</a>
<dt>The Lord gave Cain another opportunity to come by His way (<a href="gen4.htm#7" target="lwr_lt">v.7</a>) -<ol type="A">
<li>if thou doest well {or, 'if you offer correctly', LXX}...<br>
shalt thou not be accepted? {lit., 'will there not be a lifting up' (ie., of your fallen countenance)}-
<li>if thou doest not well... - two possible outcomes await his decision, because <br>
the same HB word may be translated as 'sin' or 'sin offering'. -<ol type="a">
<li><i>sin</i> lies {crouches} at the door...- ie., like a lion ready to pounce.<br>
Sin, left untreated by God's means, will make a man it's slave. cp. <a href="gen4.htm#8" target="lwr_lt">v.8</a>; <a href="rom5.htm#12">Rom 5:12-15</a>
<li>a <i>sin offering</i> lies at the door... - ie., a lamb ready for sacrifice.<br>
The Lamb of God, sets the believer free, and makes him victorious over sin's power.<br>Such salvation is entirely a gift of God's grace, and must be received by simple faith. cp. <a href="rom5.htm#20">Rom 5:20,21</a>; <a href="rom6.htm#20">6:20-23</a></ol></ol>

<b><i>4:8 And Cain talked with Abel his brother: and it came to pass, when they were in the field, <br>
that Cain rose up against Abel his brother, and slew him. </b></i>{cp. <a href="1joh3.htm#11">1Joh 3:11-15</a>}<i><b><br>
4:9 And the LORD said unto Cain, Where [is] Abel thy brother? <br>
And he said, I know not: [Am] I my brother's keeper? </b></i>{cp. <a href="pro28.htm#13">Prov 28:13</a>}<i><b><br>
4:10 And he said, What hast thou done? </b></i>{cp. <a href="luk12.htm#2">Luk 12:2</a>}<i><b><br>
the voice of thy brother's blood crieth unto me from the ground. </b></i>{cp. <a href="rev6.htm#10">Rev 6:10</a>}<i><b><br>
4:11 And now [art] thou cursed from the earth, <br>
which hath opened her mouth to receive thy brother's blood from thy hand;<br>
4:12 When thou tillest the ground, it shall not henceforth yield unto thee her strength; <br>
a fugitive and a vagabond </b></i>{ie., a wanderer}<i><b> shalt thou be in the earth.<br>
4:13 And Cain said unto the LORD, My punishment [is] greater than I can bear.<br>
4:14 Behold, thou hast driven me out this day from the face of the earth; <br>
and from thy face shall I be hid; and I shall be a fugitive and a vagabond in the earth; <br>
and it shall come to pass, [that] every one that findeth me shall slay me.<br>
4:15 And the LORD said unto him, <br>
Therefore whosoever slayeth Cain, vengeance shall be taken on him sevenfold. <br>
And the LORD set a mark upon Cain, lest any finding him should kill him.</i></b></dt><dl>
<dt>The results of Cain's false and fleshly religion- <ol type="a">
<li>murder (<a href="gen4.htm#8" target="lwr_lt">v.8</a>) - cp. <a href="joh8.htm#44">Joh 8:44</a>; <a href="joh16.htm#2">16:2,3</a>
<li>lies to God (<a href="gen4.htm#9" target="lwr_lt">v.9</a>) -<br>
Cain's response expressed impudent disrespect for his brother and for God.
<li>a further curse (<a href="gen4.htm#11" target="lwr_lt">v.11-12</a>)</ol>
<dt>Cain's response to God's judgment -<ol type="a">
<li>expressed sorrow over the inconvenience of punishment (<a href="gen4.htm#13" target="lwr_lt">v.13</a>), <br>
but not the sorrow of repentence from sin. cp. <a href="2cor7.htm#10">2Cor 7:10</a>
<li>expressed a fear of man which exceeded his fear of God (<a href="gen4.htm#14" target="lwr_lt">v.14</a>). cp. <a href="mat10.htm#28">Mat 10:28</a></ol>
<dt>the LORD set a mark upon Cain...- The mark was valid only during Cain's lifetime.
<dd>This mark is not borne by any race today, since Cain's line ended with the flood of Noah's day.
<dt>the voice of thy brother's blood...- cf. the blood ''that speaks better things...'' (<a href="heb12.htm#24">Heb 12:24</a>)<ol type="A">
<li>the blood of Abel cried out from the ground for vengeance (God's wrath) against sin.
<li>the blood of Abel's lamb could not take away sins,<br>
but it spoke of the (then future) coming of the Lamb of God. <a href="heb11.htm#4">Heb 11:4</a>
<li>the blood of Christ cries out &quot;It is finished,&quot; <br>secures God's mercy, puts away sin and purifies the sinner. <a href="heb9.htm#14">Heb 9:14</a>;  <a href="heb10.htm#22">10:22</a></ol>
</dl><dt>
<b><i>4:16 And Cain went out from the presence of the LORD, <br>
and dwelt in the land of Nod </b></i>{ie., the land of ''wandering''}<i><b>, on the east of Eden.<br>
4:17 And Cain knew his wife; and she conceived, and bare Enoch: <br>
and he builded a city, and called the name of the city, after the name of his son, Enoch.<br>
4:18 And unto Enoch was born Irad: and Irad begat Mehujael: <br>
and Mehujael begat Methusael: and Methusael begat Lamech.<br>
4:19 And Lamech took unto him two wives: <br>
the name of the one [was] Adah, and the name of the other Zillah.<br>
4:20 And Adah bare Jabal: <br>
he was the father of such as dwell in tents, and [of such as have] cattle.<br>
4:21 And his brother's name [was] Jubal: <br>
he was the father of all such as handle the harp and organ.<br>
4:22 And Zillah, she also bare Tubalcain, an instructer of every artificer in brass and iron: <br>
and the sister of Tubalcain [was] Naamah.<br>
4:23 And Lamech said unto his wives, Adah and Zillah, <br>
Hear my voice; ye wives of Lamech, hearken unto my speech: <br>
for I have slain a man to my wounding </b></i>{ie., who wounded me}<b><i>,<br>
 and a young man to my hurt </b></i>{ie., who hurt me}<i><b>.<br>
4:24 If Cain shall be avenged sevenfold, truly Lamech seventy and sevenfold.</i></b></dt><dl>
<dt>Cain went out from the presence of the LORD...- cp. <a href="rom1.htm#18">Rom 1:18-23,28</a>
<dd>The <i>ungodly line</i> of Cain is briefly traced in <a href="gen4.htm#16" target="lwr_lt">v.16-24</a>.<br>
The <i>godly line</i> of Seth will be seen in greater detail at <a href="gen4.htm#25" target="lwr_lt">v.25</a> and beyond.
<dt>The Way of Cain (<a href="jude1.htm#11">Jude 1:11</a>) - cp. <a href="pro16.htm#25">Prov 16:25</a>; <a href="mat7.htm#13">Mat 7:13,14</a>
<dd>Cain thought he could live very well without God. Therefore, he set out to make the world a respectable place and himself a respectable man. Being willfully ignorant of God's righteousness &amp; man's sin, man rejects God's remedy to <i>cleanse</i> (by the blood of the Lamb) and replaces it with his own efforts to <i>improve</i> (by the work of his own hands &amp; by the genius of his own mind).
<dt>Characteristics of the ungodly line-<ol type="a">
<li>a developed civilization- Cain's offspring excelled at <br>
construction (a city) <a href="gen4.htm#17" target="lwr_lt">v.17</a>, agriculture <a href="gen4.htm#20" target="lwr_lt">v.20</a>, the arts <a href="gen4.htm#21" target="lwr_lt">v.21</a>, and manufacturing <a href="gen4.htm#22" target="lwr_lt">v.22</a>.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is as though, Cain sought to prove God wrong concerning the punishment pronounced upon him (that Cain would be &quot;a fugitive and a vagabond&quot; {ie., 'an unstable wanderer'} in the earth, <a href="gen4.htm#12" target="lwr_lt">v.12</a>). Inspite of what God had said, Cain and his children established themselves and made a name for themselves, in the earth. But the impressive works of human brain and brawn, often hide the contents of their hearts.
<li>an ungodly culture- <br>
illustrated by Lamech's egotistic pride and willful ignorance of God's ways.<ul>
<li>he took two wives- disregarding God's design. <a href="gen2.htm#24">2:24</a>; <a href="mat19.htm#5">Mat 19:5</a>
<li>he boasted of murder (with eloquence and poetry). <a href="gen4.htm#23" target="lwr_lt">v.23,24</a>
<li>he justified himself- reasoning that he had better reason to kill than Cain,
<dd>and therefore, he was much more immune from judgment. <a href="gen4.htm#15" target="lwr_lt">v.15,23</a></dd>
<li>he twisted God's words to suit his purpose-<br>What God had spoken mercifully for Cain's protection,<br>Lamech arrogantly applied to his neighbor's destruction (<a href="gen4.htm#24" target="lwr_lt">v.24</a>).<dd>Contrast the merciful way in which the Lord Jesus applied &quot;seven times&quot; versus &quot;seventy-times seven,&quot; in <a href="mat18.htm#21">Mat 18:21,22</a>.</dd></ul></ol>
<dt><blockquote>''The earth, which on its surface displayed the genius and energy of Cain and his family, was stained underneath with the blood of a righteous man.'' It is now stained with Christ's blood. The blood which justifies the Church, condemns the world. <a href="gen4.htm#10" target="lwr_lt">v.10</a> [CHM]</blockquote>

<b><i>4:25 And Adam knew his wife again; and she bare a son, and called his name Seth: <br>
For God, [said she], hath appointed me another seed instead of Abel, whom Cain slew.<br>
4:26 And to Seth, to him also there was born a son; and he called his name Enos: <br>
then began men to call upon the name of the LORD.</i></b> {cp. <a href="gen12.htm#8">Gen 12:8</a>; <a href="gen26.htm#25">26:25</a>}</dt><dl>
<dt>The Godly Line identified -
<dd>Seth means ''appointed.'' It was evident that the promised seed (<a href="gen3.htm#15">3:15</a>) -<ul>
<li>would not come from Cain, because he was ungodly.
<li>could not come from Abel, because he was murdered.
<li>must come through Seth, whom God provided in place of the murdered spiritual man.</ul>
<dd>But their hope was not in Seth's son Enos (whose name means ''mortal''), <br>but rather in the LORD (the everliving One).<br>To 'call upon His name' is to appeal to all that He is. cp. <a href="isa55.htm#6">Isa 55:6,7</a>
