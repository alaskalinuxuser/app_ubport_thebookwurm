There was a man of the Pharisees, named Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews:<br><a name="2">2</a>  The same came to Jesus by night, and said unto him, Rabbi, we know that thou art a teacher come from God: for no man can do these miracles that thou doest, except God be with him.<br><a name="3">3</a>  Jesus answered and said unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God.<br><a name="4">4</a>  Nicodemus saith unto him, How can a man be born when he is old? can he enter the second time into his mother's womb, and be born?<br><a name="5">5</a>  Jesus answered, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born of water and [of] the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.<br><a name="6">6</a>  That which is born of the flesh is flesh; and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit.<br><a name="7">7</a>  Marvel not that I said unto thee, Ye must be born again.<br><a name="8">8</a>  The wind bloweth where it listeth, and thou hearest the sound thereof, but canst not tell whence it cometh, and whither it goeth: so is every one that is born of the Spirit.<br><a name="9">9</a>  Nicodemus answered and said unto him, How can these things be?<br><a name="10">10</a>  Jesus answered and said unto him, Art thou a master of Israel, and knowest not these things?<br><a name="11">11</a>  Verily, verily, I say unto thee, We speak that we do know, and testify that we have seen; and ye receive not our witness.<br><a name="12">12</a>  If I have told you earthly things, and ye believe not, how shall ye believe, if I tell you [of] heavenly things?<br><a name="13">13</a>  And no man hath ascended up to heaven, but he that came down from heaven, [even] the Son of man which is in heaven.<br><a name="14">14</a>  And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of man be lifted up:<br><a name="15">15</a>  That whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have eternal life.<br><a name="16">16</a>  For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.<br><a name="17">17</a>  For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved.<br><a name="18">18</a>  He that believeth on him is not condemned: but he that believeth not is condemned already, because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God.<br><a name="19">19</a>  And this is the condemnation, that light is come into the world, and men loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil.<br><a name="20">20</a>  For every one that doeth evil hateth the light, neither cometh to the light, lest his deeds should be reproved.<br><a name="21">21</a>  But he that doeth truth cometh to the light, that his deeds may be made manifest, that they are wrought in God.<br><a name="22">22</a>. After these things came Jesus and his disciples into the land of Judaea; and there he tarried with them, and baptized.<br><a name="23">23</a>  And John also was baptizing in Aenon near to Salim, because there was much water there: and they came, and were baptized.<br><a name="24">24</a>  For John was not yet cast into prison.<br><a name="25">25</a>  Then there arose a question between [some] of John's disciples and the Jews about purifying.<br><a name="26">26</a>  And they came unto John, and said unto him, Rabbi, he that was with thee beyond Jordan, to whom thou barest witness, behold, the same baptizeth, and all [men] come to him.<br><a name="27">27</a>  John answered and said, A man can receive nothing, except it be given him from heaven.<br><a name="28">28</a>  Ye yourselves bear me witness, that I said, I am not the Christ, but that I am sent before him.<br><a name="29">29</a>  He that hath the bride is the bridegroom: but the friend of the bridegroom, which standeth and heareth him, rejoiceth greatly because of the bridegroom's voice: this my joy therefore is fulfilled.<br><a name="30">30</a>  He must increase, but I [must] decrease.<br><a name="31">31</a>  He that cometh from above is above all: he that is of the earth is earthly, and speaketh of the earth: he that cometh from heaven is above all.<br><a name="32">32</a>  And what he hath seen and heard, that he testifieth; and no man receiveth his testimony.<br><a name="33">33</a>  He that hath received his testimony hath set to his seal that God is true.<br><a name="34">34</a>  For he whom God hath sent speaketh the words of God: for God giveth not the Spirit by measure [unto him].<br><a name="35">35</a>  The Father loveth the Son, and hath given all things into his hand.<br><a name="36">36</a>  He that believeth on the Son hath everlasting life: and he that believeth not the Son shall not see life; but the wrath of God abideth on him.<br><br>Go to <a href="joh4.htm#1">John 4</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
