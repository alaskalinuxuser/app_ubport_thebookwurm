<dl><dt>
<b><i>6:1. After these things Jesus went over the sea of Galilee, which is [the sea] of Tiberias.</i></b></dt><dl>
<dt>after these things- 5 to 9 months have passed since the events of ch.5 at the Pool of Bethesda.
<dd>(The time elapsed depends on which feast is meant in <a href="joh5.htm#1">5:1</a>).
<dt>Galilee- Jesus had departed from Jerusalem and has been ministering in the region of Galilee.<dd>This period of His ministry is covered by <a href="mat4.htm#12">Mat 4:12</a> through <a href="mat14.htm#12">Mat 14:12,13</a>. 
<dt>The event that opens John ch. 6, the sign of the 'Feeding of the 5000', <dd>is described in all four Gospels. cp. <a href="mat14.htm#13">Mat 14:13-33</a>; <a href="mar6.htm#32">Mark 6:32-52</a>; <a href="luk9.htm#12">Luke 9:12-17</a></dl><dt>
<b><i>6:2  And a great multitude followed him,<br>
because they saw </i></b>{lit., were seeing}<b><i> his miracles which he did on them that were diseased.</i></b>
<dd>They followed Him, but for the wrong reasons (cp. <a href="joh2.htm#23">2:23-25</a>).<br>
They did not understand that His mission was not physical healing, but spiritual salvation.<dt>
<b><i>6:3  And Jesus went up into a mountain, and there he sat with his disciples.<br>
6:4  And the passover, a feast of the Jews, was nigh.</i></b></dt><dl>
<dt>passover- This is the second Passover in John.<dd>(The previous passover: <a href="joh2.htm#13">2:13,23</a>) Jesus was crucified at the third.
<dd>The minds of the disciples &amp; the people would be on this feast &amp; its significance.
<dd>Jesus prepared a feast for them and uses it to teach that He is the true Passover.
<dd>Passover is also called the Feast of Unleavened Bread.</dl><dt>
<b><i>6:5  When Jesus then lifted up [his] eyes, and saw a great company come unto him,<br>
he saith unto Philip, Whence shall we buy bread, that these may eat?<br>
6:6  And this he said to prove him: for he himself knew what he would do.<br>
6:7  Philip answered him, Two hundred pennyworth of bread is not sufficient for them,<br>
that every one of them may take a little.</i></b></dt><dl>
<dt>Where shall we buy bread...?- While Jesus taught &amp; healed the people (cp. <a href="mat14.htm#14">Mat 14:14</a>), 
<dd>He gave Philip a task. Philip was from Bethsaida (<a href="joh1.htm#44">1:44</a>) which was not far away.
<dt>to prove him.- 'prove' is GK- peirazo, to tempt, test, assay, examine.
<dd>God tests believers to refine their faith. cp. <a href="gen22.htm#1">Gen 22:1</a>; <a href="deu8.htm#2">Deu 8:2,16</a>; <a href="jam1.htm#2">Jam 1:2,3</a>; <a href="1pet1.htm#7">1Pet 1:7</a>
<dt>Philip answered...- At the end of the day, he brought his report to Jesus.
<dt>200 pennyworth {GK= denarii}- one denarius was a day's wage for a laborer. 
<dd>Philip's assessment:
<dd>-- A man could work for the better part of a year and not have enough money to feed so many people.
<dd>-- Our group's entire treasury cannot begin to meet the need of this crowd.
<dd>Philip's advice (endorsed by other disciples): 
<dd>-- &quot;Send them away to buy for themselves...&quot; (cp. <a href="mat14.htm#15">Mat 14:15</a>).</dl><dt>
<b><i>6:8  One of his disciples, Andrew, Simon Peter's brother, saith unto him,<br>
6:9  There is a lad here, which hath five barley loaves, and two small fishes:<br>
but what are they among so many?</i></b></dt><dl>
<dt>what are they...? - A small boy's lunch, could not feed a crowd.
<dd>Andrew and Philip agreed that the situation was hopeless.
<dd>There were other occasions, in biblical history, where God fed many, when the need far exceeded any visible supply (cp. <a href="num11.htm#21">Num 11:21-23</a>; <a href="psa78.htm#19">Psa 78:19</a>; <a href="2kin4.htm#42">2Kings 4:42-44</a>). But if they remembered those miracles of provision, they saw no application to their present situation.</dl><dt>
<b><i>6:10  And Jesus said, Make the men sit down.<br>
Now there was much grass in the place.<br>
So the men sat down, in number about five thousand.<br>
6:11  And Jesus took the loaves; and when he had given thanks,<br>
he distributed to the disciples, and the disciples to them that were set down;<br>
and likewise of the fishes as much as they would.<br>
6:12  When they were filled, he said unto his disciples,<br>
Gather up the fragments that remain, that nothing be lost.<br>
6:13  Therefore they gathered [them] together,<br>
and filled twelve baskets with the fragments of the five barley loaves,<br>
which remained over and above unto them that had eaten.</i></b></dt><dl>
<dt>make [them] sit down... much grass...- &quot;As the Good Shepherd,<dd>Jesus made the sheep (<a href="mar6.htm#34">Mark 6:34</a>) sit down in green pastures.&quot; (<a href="mar6.htm#39">Mark 6:39</a>; <a href="psa23.htm#2">Psa 23:2</a>) [TBKC]
<dt>five thousand- (not counting the women and children, <a href="mat14.htm#21">Mat 14:21</a>).<dd>The total was probably 10,000 - 15,000 people.
<dt>he gave thanks- to God for His provision, as was His custom (cp. <a href="luk24.htm#30">Luk 24:30</a>).
<dt>he distributed...- cp. <a href="mar6.htm#41">Mark 6:41</a> &quot;He... broke the loaves and kept on giving to the disciples
<dd>in order that they might continue setting the bread beside them...&quot; [Wuest]
<dt>as much as they would... when they were filled... twelve baskets...over and above-
<dd>By this obvious multiplication of food, the Lord Jesus demonstrated His adequacy<br>in the face of the disciples' inadequacy. But they were slow to digest this truth.<br>cp. <a href="mar6.htm#52">Mark 6:52</a>; <a href="mar8.htm#17">8:17-21</a>; also <a href="2cor3.htm#5">2Cor 3:5</a>; <a href="2cor9.htm#8">9:8-10</a></dl><dt>
<b><i>6:14  Then those men, when they had seen the miracle</i></b> {the sign}<b><i> that Jesus did, said,<br>
This is of a truth that prophet that should come into the world.</i></b><br>
<b><i>6:15  When Jesus therefore perceived<br>
that they would come and take him by force, to make him a king,<br>
he departed again into a mountain himself alone.</i></b></dt><dl>
<dt>those men...- The crowd reacted to being fed.-<ul>
<li>Jesus is &quot;that prophet&quot; foretold by Moses. (<a href="deu18.htm#15">Deu 18:15,18</a>)<br>
To these men, He was like Moses because He had fed them in the wilderness.
<li>We'll make Him our king. They would have expected Him to...<br>-- break Israel's servitude to Rome, and<br>-- lead them into unprecedented prosperity. (cp. <a href="joh12.htm#12">Joh 12:12,13</a>; <a href="psa118.htm#25">Psa 118:25</a>)<br>They would have 'forced' their will upon Him. But it is the King's will that must be supreme.</ul>
<dt>Jesus...perceived- cp. <a href="joh2.htm#24">2:24,25</a>
<dt>Jesus...departed into a mountain...alone...- &quot;to pray&quot; (<a href="mat14.htm#22">Mat 14:22,23</a>).
<dd>We are not told what he prayed. But two things must have burdened His heart:<ol type="a">
<li>That He would not be detoured from His mission as the Lamb of God.<dd>He will be established as the King of Israel, but not by man's will, methods or time table.</dd><dd>Everything concerning Him<i> must be </i>according to God's plan. cp. <a href="joh3.htm#14">3:14,15</a>; <a href="mar8.htm#31">Mark 8:31</a>
<li>That His disciples would not be caught up in the political fervor of the crowd.
<dd>Note that He 'constrained' them to depart, before He went 'apart to pray' (<a href="mat14.htm#22">Mat 14:22,23</a>).</dd>
<li>That His disciples would come safely through the storm of spiritual opposition which would soon turn others away (<a href="joh6.htm#66" target="lwr_lt">vs.66,67</a>; cp. <a href="luk22.htm#31">Luk 22:31,32</a>).</ol>
<dd>Intercession is the work of a priest. Note that Jesus is Prophet (<a href="joh6.htm#14" target="lwr_lt">v.14</a>), Priest, and King (<a href="joh6.htm#15" target="lwr_lt">v.15</a>).</dl><dt>
<b><i>6:16  And when even was [now] come, his disciples went down unto the sea,<br>
6:17  And entered into a ship, and went over the sea toward Capernaum.<br>
And it was now dark, and Jesus was not come to them.<br>
6:18  And the sea arose by reason of a great wind that blew.<br>
6:19  So when they had rowed about five and twenty or thirty furlongs, </i></b>{ie., 3 or 3.5 miles}
<dd>They were in the middle of the Sea of Galilee. Although they had been toiling in rowing all night, they had made little progress, due to the contrary winds. cp. <a href="mat14.htm#24">Mat 14:24,25a</a><dt>
<b><i>they see Jesus walking on the sea, and drawing nigh unto the ship:<br>
and they were afraid.<br> 
6:20  But he saith unto them, It is I; be not afraid.<br>
6:21  Then they willingly received him into the ship:<br>
and immediately the ship was at the land whither they went.</i></b></dt><dl>
<dt>It is I; be not afraid.-  cp. <a href="mat14.htm#25">Mat 14:25-33</a>; <a href="isa43.htm#1">Isa 43:1-3</a>
<dd>Matthew's account brings out their fear...<ul>
<li>in the unexpected appearance of Jesus walking on the water, when they thought He was a ghost. 
<li>in the boistrous waves, as Peter's faith faltered in his walk with Jesus.
<li>in the awesome presence of the Son of God.</ul>
[See the <a href="notemenu.htm" target="lwr_lt">Book Notes</a> at Matthew 14:24-33.]
<dt>immediately...at the land.-
<dd>&quot;This may be another miracle or John may mean that with no delay they reached the other side, since the water was now calm. Or, it may be the language of love -- with Jesus in the boat, it didn't seem far to the other side.&quot; [McGee]
<dt>This account gives a preview to the outcome of the disciples' inner struggles (in the remainder of ch.6).
<dd>For awhile, they would be confused and afraid, not really knowing who Jesus is, as they struggle against the opposition of unbelievers and the offense of the Gospel. But in the end, having recognized Him and received Him into their lives, they will come to rest their faith upon Him.</dl><dt>
<b><i>6:22  The day following, when the people which stood on the other side of the sea saw<br>
that there was none other boat there, save that one whereinto his disciples were entered,<br>
and that Jesus went not with his disciples into the boat,<br>
but [that] his disciples were gone away alone;<br>
6:23  (Howbeit there came other boats from Tiberias nigh unto<br>
the place where they did eat bread, after that the Lord had given thanks:)<br>
6:24  When the people therefore saw that Jesus was not there, neither his disciples,<br>
they also took shipping, and came to Capernaum, seeking for Jesus.<br>
6:25  And when they had found him on the other side of the sea,<br>
they said unto him, Rabbi, when camest thou hither?</i></b></dt><dl>
<dt>seeking for Jesus- Their search required expenditure of thought, money &amp; time.
<dd>But their efforts were in vain, because they sought Him for the wrong reasons (<a href="joh6.htm#26" target="lwr_lt">v.26</a>).
<dt>when camest thou hither?- Jesus does not answer their question. 
<dd>His walk on the water was a private sign for His disciples. </dl><dt>
<b><i>6:26  Jesus answered them and said, Verily, verily, I say unto you,<br>
Ye seek me, not because ye saw the miracles</i></b> {signs, 'attesting miracles' [Wuest]}<b><i>, <br>
but because ye did eat of the loaves, and were filled.<br>
6:27  Labour not for the meat which perisheth, </i></b>{<a href="ecc2.htm#11">Eccl 2:11</a>; <a href="ecc6.htm#7">6:7</a>}<b><i><br>
but for that meat which endureth unto everlasting life,</i></b> {<a href="isa55.htm#2">Isa 55:2</a>}<b><i><br>
which the Son of man shall give unto you: for him hath God the Father sealed.</i></b></dt><dl>
<dt>Jesus answered- according to His knowledge of their heart motives. (cp. <a href="joh2.htm#24">2:24,25</a>)
<dd>Like dogs, they desired food for the body, they would follow anyone who could provide it. (cp. <a href="php2.htm#21">Php 2:21</a>; <a href="php3.htm#19">3:19</a>)<dd>They did not recognize the significance of the signs that attested to His identity. cp. <a href="joh5.htm#36">5:36,43</a>
<dt>labor not for food that perishes...but for that...which endures- cp. <a href="mat4.htm#4">Mat 4:4</a>; <a href="mat6.htm#31">6:31-33</a>
<dd>If your heart desires that which God says is of lasting value, you will find it, in finding His Son.  
<dt>which the Son...shall give {not sell}- cp. <a href="joh6.htm#29" target="lwr_lt">v. 29</a>; <a href="eph2.htm#8">Eph 2:8,9</a>
<dt>Him hath God the Father sealed- 'sealed' means: authenticated, or signified. 
<dd>cp. <a href="psa2.htm#6">Psa 2:6,7</a>; <a href="isa42.htm#1">Isa 42:1</a>; <a href="joh5.htm#37">Joh 5:37,38</a>; (also see this word, as used in <a href="joh3.htm#33">3:33</a>.)</dl><dt>
<b><i>6:28  Then said they unto him, What shall we do, that we might work the works of God?</i></b>
<dd>Self-righteous flesh thinks it can earn what only God can give. <a href="rom10.htm#2">Rom 10:2-4</a><dt>
<b><i>6:29  Jesus answered and said unto them,<br>
This is the work of God, that ye believe on him whom he hath sent.</i></b></dt><dl>
<dt>believe on Him...- cp. <a href="eph2.htm#8">Eph 2:8,9</a>; <a href="tit3.htm#5">Titus 3:5</a>
<dt>whom He hath sent {ie., sent on a mission}- to accomplish the work of salvation. <dd>cp. <a href="joh6.htm#38" target="lwr_lt">v.38,39</a>; <a href="joh4.htm#34">4:34</a>; <a href="joh5.htm#36">5:36</a>; <a href="joh19.htm#30">19:30</a><dd>In the remainder of ch.6, Jesus shows that He and His work are essential to life.</dl><dt>
<b><i>6:30  They said therefore unto him,<br>
What sign shewest thou then, that we may see, and believe thee?<br>
what dost thou work?<br>
6:31  Our fathers did eat manna in the desert;<br>
as it is written, He gave them bread from heaven to eat.</i></b></dt><dl>
<dt>what sign...?- cp. <a href="1cor1.htm#22">1Cor 1:22</a>; <a href="joh12.htm#37">Joh 12:37</a><ul>
<li>Had they already forgotten the feeding of the 5000 (<a href="joh6.htm#10" target="lwr_lt">v.10-13</a>) and the many miracles of healing (<a href="mat14.htm#14">Mat 14:14</a>) of the previous day?
<li>Did they discount those as inadequate signs?
<li>Had those miracles merely whetted their appetites for more free meals?<br>
After all, Moses had fed a much larger number of people continuously for 40 years.<br>
&quotThe rabbis taught that the former redeemer, Moses, caused manna to descend from heaven for them, and that the latter redeemer, Messiah, would perform a similar miracle.&quot; [GWms]</ul></dl><dt>
<b><i>6:32  Then Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you,<br>
Moses gave you not that bread from heaven;<br>
but my Father giveth you the true bread from heaven.<br>
6:33  For the bread of God is<br>
he which cometh down from heaven, and giveth life unto the world.</i></b></dt><dl>
<dt>Jesus corrected their misconceptions, and taught the truth.-<ol type="A">
<li>The Father, not Moses, gave {past tense} manna. (<a href="ex16.htm#15">Ex 16:15</a>; <a href="psa78.htm#4">Psa 78:4,24,25</a>)
<li>The Father gives {present tense} the true {genuine} Bread from heaven. (<a href="joh6.htm#49" target="lwr_lt">v.49,50</a>)
<li>The True Bread from heaven is Jesus, not the manna. (<a href="joh6.htm#33" target="lwr_lt">v.33</a>; <a href="joh1.htm#4">1:4</a>; <a href="joh5.htm#26">5:26</a>)</ol></dl><dt>
<b><i>6:34  Then said they unto him, Lord, evermore give us this bread.</i></b>
<dd>give us this bread- They were still focused on physical satisfaction. cp. <a href="joh6.htm#27" target="lwr_lt">v.27</a>; <a href="joh4.htm#15">4:15</a>
<dd>evermore- ie., not merely for 40 years.<dt><dt>
<b><i>6:35 And Jesus said unto them, I am the bread of life:<br>
he that cometh to me shall never hunger; and he that believeth on me shall never thirst.</i></b></dt><dl>
<dt>the bread of life- ie., the staple without which man cannot live.
<dt>I am...- The bread of life is a Person. The Lord Jesus Christ is revealed as-<ul>
<li>the true Sabbath, in <a href="joh5.htm#16">ch.5</a>.

<li>the true Passover (Feast of Unleavened Bread), in ch. 6<br>
-- He is the Bread which came down from heaven (<a href="joh6.htm#38" target="lwr_lt">v.38</a>).<br>
-- He gave His flesh &amp; blood that man might escape death and enter into life (<a href="joh6.htm#53" target="lwr_lt">v.53,54</a>).</ul>

<dd>They, being spiritually unreceptive (<a href="joh6.htm#44" target="lwr_lt">v.44,41</a>; <a href="1cor2.htm#14">1Cor 2:14</a>), think He is speaking of cannibalism.
<dt>It is important to note that He is <i>not</i> speaking of eating physical food in <i>any sense</i>. <dd>Although the symbols of <a href="joh6.htm#51" target="lwr_lt">v.51-57</a> are shared with the Lord's Supper, <dd>these verses do not refer to participation in Communion. (See note at v.63.) <dd>The occasion here is near the second Passover of His ministry.<dd>Another year would pass before He would  institute the Lord's Supper.<br>Jesus here explains that He fulfills the true meaning of Passover (<a href="joh6.htm#4" target="lwr_lt">v.4</a>).<dd>At the first Passover, <i>the redeemed people were closely identified with the sacrificial lamb.</i><ul><li>They ate unleavened bread while the lamb was in the house and after it was slain.<li>They placed themselves under its blood for redemption.<li>They ate its roasted flesh, on that one night only (cp. <a href="ex12.htm#1">Ex 12:1-13</a>).<li>Those not so identified were cut off from Israel, and unprotected from judgment (<a href="ex12.htm#15">Ex 12:15,23</a>).</ul>Subsequent Passover meals would be commemorative of this redemption (<a href="ex12.htm#14">Ex 12:14</a>), but they could never duplicate that unique and historic redemption.
<dt>my flesh... for the life of the world...-
<dd>As the sacrifice of the passover lamb provided salvation, for those who were under its blood and who partook of it... in like manner, the one sacrificial death of the Lamb of God brings salvation (<a href="joh1.htm#29">1:29</a>). In effect, Jesus was saying: 'You must be fully identified with Me, if you are to benefit from the redemption provided in My sacrificial death.'
<dt>the bread... is my flesh which I will give...-<dd>&quot;Not only is the Father giving the Bread (Jesus, <a href="joh6.htm#32" target="lwr_lt">v.32</a>), but also Jesus is giving Himself.&quot; [TBKC]</dl><dt>

<dt>verily, verily...- &quot;In reply to the impossibility of eating His flesh (<a href="joh6.htm#52" target="lwr_lt">v.52</a>), <dd>the Lord, instead of softening or modifying this seemingly harsh doctrine, intensified it by <ul><li>declaring it indispensable to salvation (<a href="joh6.htm#53" target="lwr_lt">v.53</a>), and <li>stating that only those who thus eat and drink as a definite action (GK aorist tense, v.53),<br>and continue thus eating and drinking (present tense, v.54-57), have spiritual life.&quot; [in quotes, GWms]</ul>
<dt>flesh... blood...- The separation of flesh and blood is death. 
<dd>-- Jesus' death was according to God's will, and at Jesus' discretion (<a href="joh6.htm#51" target="lwr_lt">v.51</a>, 'I will give... I will give...').
<dd>-- Jesus' death is the believer's life. <a href="2cor5.htm#21">2Cor 5:21</a>; <a href="gal2.htm#20">Gal 2:20</a>; <a href="php3.htm#7">Php 3:7-10</a>
<dt>drink his blood- There are two offensive elements here to the self-righteous mind:
<dd>-- the idea of physically eating His flesh or drinking His blood, cp. <a href="lev3.htm#17">Lev 3:17</a>
<dd>-- the idea that Christ's sacrificial death is required for my sin, cp. <a href="lev17.htm#10">Lev 17:10-14</a>.
<dt>he who drinketh... hath eternal life- A comparison of <a href="joh6.htm#47" target="lwr_lt">v.47,48</a> with <a href="joh6.htm#53" target="lwr_lt">53,54</a> shows that
<dd>'believing on Christ' is equivalent to 'eating and drinking' Him.
<dd>Similar symbolism is used elsewhere. cp. <a href="deu8.htm#3">Deut 8:3</a>; <a href="jer15.htm#16">Jer 15:16</a>; <a href="eze2.htm#8">Ezek 2:8,9</a></dl><dt>

<dd>Bread, once eaten, digested, and absorbed by the body, is inseparable from the eater. 
<dd>So, the believer's life is sourced in, and bound together with, the person of Christ. cp. <a href="col3.htm#3">Col 3:3,4</a>.
<dt>as... I live by the Father...- As the Son does not live a life independent from the Father, 
<dd>so the believer does not live a life independent from Christ (cp. <a href="joh4.htm#34">4:34</a>; <a href="joh5.htm#19">5:19</a>; <a href="joh15.htm#5">15:5</a>).</dl><dt>

<dt>Jesus concludes His message in the synagogue by reviewing its major points (<a href="joh6.htm#58" target="lwr_lt">v.58</a>).-<ul>
<li>The bread from heaven, in Moses' day, did not give lasting life.<li>God has given the genuine Bread in the Person of His Son.<li>The person who fully trusts in (partakes of, is inseparably joined to) Him has everlasting life.</ul></dl><dt>
<b><i>6:60  Many therefore of his disciples, when they had heard [this],<br>
said, This is an hard saying; who can hear it?</i></b></dt><dl>
<dt>disciples- 'those who had been following His teaching and learning from Him...' [Wuest]
<dd>Many, who call themselves 'disciples,' will not submit to His authority, even today. cp. <a href="luk6.htm#46">Luk 6:46</a>

<dd>or, '...Offensive and intolerable is this discourse.' [Wuest]</dl><dt>
<b><i>6:61  When Jesus knew in himself that his disciples murmured at it,<br>

<dd>offend- GK= skandalizai, to scandalize, to cause to stumble.
<dd>The noun form of this word is used in <a href="1cor1.htm#23">1Cor 1:23</a> (a stumbling-block). <dt><dt>
<b><i>6:62  [What] and if ye shall see the Son of man ascend up where he was before?</i></b></dt><dl>

<dt>How much more would they be scandalized when His rejected words would be confirmed by
His resurrection, ascension, and return to the Father? cp. <a href="mar14.htm#61">Mark 14:61-64</a>; <a href="joh3.htm#13">Joh 3:13</a>; <a href="joh16.htm#28">16:28</a></dl><dt><a name="63"></a>

the words that I speak unto you, [they] are spirit, and [they] are life.</i></b></dt><dl>
<dt>the Spirit gives life- But that life is spiritual life, and does not benefit the flesh. cp. <a href="joh3.htm#5">3:5-6</a>
<dt>the words...- Spiritual life is given to those who respond to Christ's message, and trust in Him. 
<dd>cp. <a href="joh6.htm#47" target="lwr_lt">Joh 6:47</a>; <a href="joh8.htm#24">8:24</a>; <a href="rom10.htm#8">Rom 10:8-10</a><dt>
<dt><b>Regarding the Lord's Supper</b> (or Communion): 
<dd>The Sacramental churches view <a href="joh6.htm#51" target="lwr_lt">v.51-58</a> as teaching their doctrine of Transubstantiation.<br>
According to this doctrine, the bread and wine at the celebration of the Lord's Supper (ie., 'the Eucharist,' or 'the Mass') become the actual body and blood of the dead or suffering Christ. They teach that grace or merit is conferred to the worshipper by the physical act of eating Christ's Body and drinking His Blood.<br>
However, this doctrine is not scriptural. Consider the following points:<ol type="1">
<li>The food &amp; drink which Jesus spoke of is spiritual and does not benefit the flesh (<a href="joh6.htm#63" target="lwr_lt">v.63</a>).<br>
Neither is God's grace administered through the flesh (cp. <a href="gal6.htm#14">Gal 6:14,15</a>; <a href="php3.htm#4">Php 3:4-9</a>).
<li>The 'one sacrifice for sins forever' which Jesus offered on the cross has made fleshly ritual obsolete. (Ritual had always been ineffective.)  <a href="heb10.htm#1">Heb 10:1-18</a>; <a href="heb13.htm#9">13:9</a>
<li>While Jesus may be spiritually omnipresent, physically He is in only one place at a time.<dd>He is now seated at the right hand of the Father (<a href="heb1.htm#3">Heb 1:3</a>).</dd><dd>In the future, He will bodily return to earth (<a href="act1.htm#11">Acts 1:11</a>).</dd><dd>Therefore, He cannot be bodily present at multiple altars in the eucharist.</dd>
<li>In the OT, blood made atonement at the altar.<br>But it was forbidden to drink blood. (<a href="lev17.htm#10">Lev 17:10-14</a>)<dd>Likewise, Jesus shed His blood for us at the cross. Believers do not drink His actual blood.</dd>
<li>In the upper room, Jesus used bread &amp; wine as<i> symbols </i>of His sacrifice.-<ul>
<li>He established a memorial meal:<br>&quot;...This do in remembrance of me.&quot; <a href="luk22.htm#19">Luk 22:19,20</a>; <a href="1cor11.htm#25">1Cor 11:25,26</a>
<li>He referred to the cup as 'the fruit of the vine'<i> after </i>saying 'this is my blood' (<a href="mat26.htm#28">Mat 26:28,29</a>).
<li>He said 'this is my body' (referring to the bread) while He was still bodily present (<a href="luk22.htm#19">Luk 22:19</a>).</ul>
<li>Jesus spoke figuratively of 'eating my flesh and drinking my blood' to show...<ul><li>The necessity of believing in Him (cp. <a href="joh6.htm#47" target="lwr_lt">47,48</a> with <a href="joh6.htm#53" target="lwr_lt">53,54</a>).<li>The vitality of a true believer's relationship with Him (<a href="joh6.htm#56" target="lwr_lt">v.56,57</a>).<br>He compares this relationship to His relationship to the Father (in which physical food has no contributing role).</ul>
<li>The Holy Spirit joins the believer to the<i> living </i>Christ, not to His dead or suffering body. cp. <a href="joh6.htm#56" target="lwr_lt">v.56,57</a>; <a href="1cor12.htm#12">1Cor 12:12,13</a>; <a href="gal2.htm#20">Gal 2:20</a>; <a href="gal3.htm#27">3:27</a></ol></dl><dt>
<b><i>6:64  But there are some of you that believe not. </i></b>
<dd>(and, therefore, have no spiritual life, and are not spiritually benefited by His words. <a href="joh6.htm#63" target="lwr_lt">v.63</a>)<dt>
