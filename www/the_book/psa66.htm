Psalms  66<br>1. To the chief Musician, A Song [or] Psalm. Make a joyful noise unto God, all ye lands:<br><a name="2">2</a>  Sing forth the honour of his name: make his praise glorious.<br><a name="3">3</a>  Say unto God, How terrible [art thou in] thy works! through the greatness of thy power shall thine enemies submit themselves unto thee.<br><a name="4">4</a>  All the earth shall worship thee, and shall sing unto thee; they shall sing [to] thy name. Selah.<br><a name="5">5</a>  Come and see the works of God: [he is] terrible [in his] doing toward the children of men.<br><a name="6">6</a>  He turned the sea into dry [land]: they went through the flood on foot: there did we rejoice in him.<br><a name="7">7</a>  He ruleth by his power for ever; his eyes behold the nations: let not the rebellious exalt themselves. Selah.<br><a name="8">8</a>. O bless our God, ye people, and make the voice of his praise to be heard:<br><a name="9">9</a>  Which holdeth our soul in life, and suffereth not our feet to be moved.<br><a name="10">10</a>  For thou, O God, hast proved us: thou hast tried us, as silver is tried.<br><a name="11">11</a>  Thou broughtest us into the net; thou laidst affliction upon our loins.<br><a name="12">12</a>  Thou hast caused men to ride over our heads; we went through fire and through water: but thou broughtest us out into a wealthy [place].<br><a name="13">13</a>. I will go into thy house with burnt offerings: I will pay thee my vows,<br><a name="14">14</a>  Which my lips have uttered, and my mouth hath spoken, when I was in trouble.<br><a name="15">15</a>  I will offer unto thee burnt sacrifices of fatlings, with the incense of rams; I will offer bullocks with goats. Selah.<br><a name="16">16</a>  Come [and] hear, all ye that fear God, and I will declare what he hath done for my soul.<br><a name="17">17</a>  I cried unto him with my mouth, and he was extolled with my tongue.<br><a name="18">18</a>  If I regard iniquity in my heart, the Lord will not hear [me]:<br><a name="19">19</a>  [But] verily God hath heard [me]; he hath attended to the voice of my prayer.<br><a name="20">20</a>  Blessed [be] God, which hath not turned away my prayer, nor his mercy from me.<br><br>Go to <a href="psa67.htm#1">Psalm 67</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
