Ezekiel  25<br>1. The word of the LORD came again unto me, saying,<br><a name="2">2</a>  Son of man, set thy face against the Ammonites, and prophesy against them;<br><a name="3">3</a>  And say unto the Ammonites, Hear the word of the Lord GOD; Thus saith the Lord GOD; Because thou saidst, Aha, against my sanctuary, when it was profaned; and against the land of Israel, when it was desolate; and against the house of Judah, when they went into captivity;<br><a name="4">4</a>  Behold, therefore I will deliver thee to the men of the east for a possession, and they shall set their palaces in thee, and make their dwellings in thee: they shall eat thy fruit, and they shall drink thy milk.<br><a name="5">5</a>  And I will make Rabbah a stable for camels, and the Ammonites a couchingplace for flocks: and ye shall know that I [am] the LORD.<br><a name="6">6</a>  For thus saith the Lord GOD; Because thou hast clapped [thine] hands, and stamped with the feet, and rejoiced in heart with all thy despite against the land of Israel;<br><a name="7">7</a>  Behold, therefore I will stretch out mine hand upon thee, and will deliver thee for a spoil to the heathen; and I will cut thee off from the people, and I will cause thee to perish out of the countries: I will destroy thee; and thou shalt know that I [am] the LORD.<br><a name="8">8</a>. Thus saith the Lord GOD; Because that Moab and Seir do say, Behold, the house of Judah [is] like unto all the heathen;<br><a name="9">9</a>  Therefore, behold, I will open the side of Moab from the cities, from his cities [which are] on his frontiers, the glory of the country, Bethjeshimoth, Baalmeon, and Kiriathaim,<br><a name="10">10</a>  Unto the men of the east with the Ammonites, and will give them in possession, that the Ammonites may not be remembered among the nations.<br><a name="11">11</a>  And I will execute judgments upon Moab; and they shall know that I [am] the LORD.<br><a name="12">12</a>  Thus saith the Lord GOD; Because that Edom hath dealt against the house of Judah by taking vengeance, and hath greatly offended, and revenged himself upon them;<br><a name="13">13</a>  Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; I will also stretch out mine hand upon Edom, and will cut off man and beast from it; and I will make it desolate from Teman; and they of Dedan shall fall by the sword.<br><a name="14">14</a>  And I will lay my vengeance upon Edom by the hand of my people Israel: and they shall do in Edom according to mine anger and according to my fury; and they shall know my vengeance, saith the Lord GOD.<br><a name="15">15</a>  Thus saith the Lord GOD; Because the Philistines have dealt by revenge, and have taken vengeance with a despiteful heart, to destroy [it] for the old hatred;<br><a name="16">16</a>  Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I will stretch out mine hand upon the Philistines, and I will cut off the Cherethims, and destroy the remnant of the sea coast.<br><a name="17">17</a>  And I will execute great vengeance upon them with furious rebukes; and they shall know that I [am] the LORD, when I shall lay my vengeance upon them.<br><br>Go to <a href="eze26.htm#1">Ezekiel 26</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
