Lamentations   4<br> 1. How is the gold become dim! [how] is the most fine gold changed! the stones of the sanctuary are poured out in the top of every street.<br><a name="2">2</a>  The precious sons of Zion, comparable to fine gold, how are they esteemed as earthen pitchers, the work of the hands of the potter!<br><a name="3">3</a>  Even the sea monsters draw out the breast, they give suck to their young ones: the daughter of my people [is become] cruel, like the ostriches in the wilderness.<br><a name="4">4</a>  The tongue of the sucking child cleaveth to the roof of his mouth for thirst: the young children ask bread, [and] no man breaketh [it] unto them.<br><a name="5">5</a>  They that did feed delicately are desolate in the streets: they that were brought up in scarlet embrace dunghills.<br><a name="6">6</a>  For the punishment of the iniquity of the daughter of my people is greater than the punishment of the sin of Sodom, that was overthrown as in a moment, and no hands stayed on her.<br><a name="7">7</a>  Her Nazarites were purer than snow, they were whiter than milk, they were more ruddy in body than rubies, their polishing [was] of sapphire:<br><a name="8">8</a>  Their visage is blacker than a coal; they are not known in the streets: their skin cleaveth to their bones; it is withered, it is become like a stick.<br><a name="9">9</a>  [They that be] slain with the sword are better than [they that be] slain with hunger: for these pine away, stricken through for [want of] the fruits of the field.<br><a name="10">10</a>  The hands of the pitiful women have sodden their own children: they were their meat in the destruction of the daughter of my people.<br><a name="11">11</a>  The LORD hath accomplished his fury; he hath poured out his fierce anger, and hath kindled a fire in Zion, and it hath devoured the foundations thereof.<br><a name="12">12</a>  The kings of the earth, and all the inhabitants of the world, would not have believed that the adversary and the enemy should have entered into the gates of Jerusalem.<br><a name="13">13</a>. For the sins of her prophets, [and] the iniquities of her priests, that have shed the blood of the just in the midst of her,<br><a name="14">14</a>  They have wandered [as] blind [men] in the streets, they have polluted themselves with blood, so that men could not touch their garments.<br><a name="15">15</a>  They cried unto them, Depart ye; [it is] unclean; depart, depart, touch not: when they fled away and wandered, they said among the heathen, They shall no more sojourn [there].<br><a name="16">16</a>  The anger of the LORD hath divided them; he will no more regard them: they respected not the persons of the priests, they favoured not the elders.<br><a name="17">17</a>  As for us, our eyes as yet failed for our vain help: in our watching we have watched for a nation [that] could not save [us].<br><a name="18">18</a>  They hunt our steps, that we cannot go in our streets: our end is near, our days are fulfilled; for our end is come.<br><a name="19">19</a>  Our persecutors are swifter than the eagles of the heaven: they pursued us upon the mountains, they laid wait for us in the wilderness.<br><a name="20">20</a>  The breath of our nostrils, the anointed of the LORD, was taken in their pits, of whom we said, Under his shadow we shall live among the heathen.<br><a name="21">21</a>. Rejoice and be glad, O daughter of Edom, that dwellest in the land of Uz; the cup also shall pass through unto thee: thou shalt be drunken, and shalt make thyself naked.<br><a name="22">22</a>  The punishment of thine iniquity is accomplished, O daughter of Zion; he will no more carry thee away into captivity: he will visit thine iniquity, O daughter of Edom; he will discover thy sins.<br><br>Go to <a href="lam5.htm#1">Lamentations 5</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
