<dl><dd>I.D.2. <b>Praise to Jehovah as deliverer and comforter of Zion</b>, 25:1-12 
<dt><b><i>1. O LORD, thou [art] my God; I will exalt thee, I will praise thy name;<br>for thou hast done wonderful [things; thy] counsels of old [are] faithfulness [and] truth.<br>
2 For thou hast made of a city an heap; [of] a defenced city a ruin:<br>a palace of strangers to be no city; it shall never be built.<br>
3 Therefore shall the strong people glorify thee, the city of the terrible nations shall fear thee.<br>
4 For thou hast been a strength to the poor, a strength to the needy in his distress,<br>a refuge from the storm, a shadow from the heat,<br>when the blast of the terrible ones [is] as a storm [against] the wall.<br>
5 Thou shalt bring down the noise of strangers, as the heat in a dry place;<br>[even] the heat with the shadow of a cloud:<br>the branch of the terrible ones shall be brought low.</i></b></dt><dl>
<dt>O LORD, thou art my God; I will exalt thee...-<dd>This song of praise will be sung by the believing Remnant of Israel, as they see their Messiah coming to establish His Kingdom in Jerusalem (<a href="isa24.htm#23">24:23</a>). Note that verses 2 and 4 are in the past tense, showing the time of this song. Those who sing, having been preserved through the Tribulation period, raise their song at the fall of Babylon the Great (cp. <a href="rev18.htm#20">Rev 18:20 - 19:6</a>). The remainder of the chapter is in the future tense, in anticipation of the blessings that will soon flow from Christ's Kingdom.
<dt>for thou hast done wonderful things; thy counsels of old are faithfulness and truth.-<dd>They sing of what the Lord has done, in fulfilment of His Word. The song has three stanzas:<ol><li>Praise for the Lord's deliverance from the enemy (<a href="isa25.htm#1" target="lwr_lt">v.1-5</a>)<li>Praise for the Lord's provision for all people (<a href="isa25.htm#6" target="lwr_lt">v.6-8</a>)<li>Praise for the Lord's Personal Presence in the Messiah (<a href="isa25.htm#9" target="lwr_lt">v.9-12</a>)</ol>
<dt>The believing Remnant sings in...
<dd>1. Praise for the Lord's deliverance (v.1-5)...
<ul><li>in the fulfillment of His Word which is faithful and true. <a href="isa25.htm#1" target="lwr_lt">v.1</a> (cf. <a href="isa24.htm#5">24:5</a>)
<li>in the destruction of Babylon, representing gentile world dominion.-<dd>Those who remain of the formerly dominant nations (the 'strong' and 'terrible'), have come to fear the true God (<a href="isa25.htm#2" target="lwr_lt">v.2,3</a>; cp. <a href="eze38.htm#23">Eze 38:23</a>; <a href="eze39.htm#21">39:21,22</a>).</dd><li>in the preservation and restoration of Israel.-<dd>The weak were made strong through the strength of their God (<a href="isa25.htm#4" target="lwr_lt">v.4</a>). Though the terrifying powers of the world came together against God's people in the storm and heat of the Tribulation, the Lord has brought their violence to silence (<a href="isa25.htm#5" target="lwr_lt">v.5</a>; cp. <a href="isa4.htm#5">Isa 4:5,6</a>).</dd></ul></dl>
<dt><b><i>6. And in this mountain shall the LORD of hosts make unto all people a feast of fat things,<br>a feast of wines on the lees, of fat things full of marrow, of wines on the lees well refined.<br>
7 And he will destroy in this mountain the face of the covering cast over all people,<br>and the vail that is spread over all nations.<br>
8 He will swallow up death in victory;<br>and the Lord GOD will wipe away tears from off all faces;<br>and the rebuke of his people shall he take away from off all the earth:<br>for the LORD hath spoken [it].</i></b></dt><dl>

10 For in this mountain shall the hand of the LORD rest,<br>and Moab shall be trodden down under him, even as straw is trodden down for the dunghill.<br>
11 And he shall spread forth his hands in the midst of them,<br>as he that swimmeth spreadeth forth [his hands] to swim:<br>and he shall bring down their pride together with the spoils of their hands.<br>

Babylon often appears as a political oppressor and Moab as a religious corruptor (<a href="num22.htm#1">Num 22 - 24</a>); so in this vision they picture, in unity, Anti-Christ and the False Prophet.&quot; [in quotes, GWms]</ul>
