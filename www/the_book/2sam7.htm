2Samuel   7<br> 1. And it came to pass, when the king sat in his house, and the LORD had given him rest round about from all his enemies;<br><a name="2">2</a>  That the king said unto Nathan the prophet, See now, I dwell in an house of cedar, but the ark of God dwelleth within curtains.<br><a name="3">3</a>  And Nathan said to the king, Go, do all that [is] in thine heart; for the LORD [is] with thee.<br><a name="4">4</a>. And it came to pass that night, that the word of the LORD came unto Nathan, saying,<br><a name="5">5</a>  Go and tell my servant David, Thus saith the LORD, Shalt thou build me an house for me to dwell in?<br><a name="6">6</a>  Whereas I have not dwelt in [any] house since the time that I brought up the children of Israel out of Egypt, even to this day, but have walked in a tent and in a tabernacle.<br><a name="7">7</a>  In all [the places] wherein I have walked with all the children of Israel spake I a word with any of the tribes of Israel, whom I commanded to feed my people Israel, saying, Why build ye not me an house of cedar?<br><a name="8">8</a>  Now therefore so shalt thou say unto my servant David, Thus saith the LORD of hosts, I took thee from the sheepcote, from following the sheep, to be ruler over my people, over Israel:<br><a name="9">9</a>  And I was with thee whithersoever thou wentest, and have cut off all thine enemies out of thy sight, and have made thee a great name, like unto the name of the great [men] that [are] in the earth.<br><a name="10">10</a>  Moreover I will appoint a place for my people Israel, and will plant them, that they may dwell in a place of their own, and move no more; neither shall the children of wickedness afflict them any more, as beforetime,<br><a name="11">11</a>  And as since the time that I commanded judges [to be] over my people Israel, and have caused thee to rest from all thine enemies. Also the LORD telleth thee that he will make thee an house.<br><a name="12">12</a>  And when thy days be fulfilled, and thou shalt sleep with thy fathers, I will set up thy seed after thee, which shall proceed out of thy bowels, and I will establish his kingdom.<br><a name="13">13</a>  He shall build an house for my name, and I will stablish the throne of his kingdom for ever.<br><a name="14">14</a>  I will be his father, and he shall be my son. If he commit iniquity, I will chasten him with the rod of men, and with the stripes of the children of men:<br><a name="15">15</a>  But my mercy shall not depart away from him, as I took [it] from Saul, whom I put away before thee.<br><a name="16">16</a>  And thine house and thy kingdom shall be established for ever before thee: thy throne shall be established for ever.<br><a name="17">17</a>  According to all these words, and according to all this vision, so did Nathan speak unto David.<br><a name="18">18</a>. Then went king David in, and sat before the LORD, and he said, Who [am] I, O Lord GOD? and what [is] my house, that thou hast brought me hitherto?<br><a name="19">19</a>  And this was yet a small thing in thy sight, O Lord GOD; but thou hast spoken also of thy servant's house for a great while to come. And [is] this the manner of man, O Lord GOD?<br><a name="20">20</a>  And what can David say more unto thee? for thou, Lord GOD, knowest thy servant.<br><a name="21">21</a>  For thy word's sake, and according to thine own heart, hast thou done all these great things, to make thy servant know [them].<br><a name="22">22</a>  Wherefore thou art great, O LORD God: for [there is] none like thee, neither [is there any] God beside thee, according to all that we have heard with our ears.<br><a name="23">23</a>  And what one nation in the earth [is] like thy people, [even] like Israel, whom God went to redeem for a people to himself, and to make him a name, and to do for you great things and terrible, for thy land, before thy people, which thou redeemedst to thee from Egypt, [from] the nations and their gods?<br><a name="24">24</a>  For thou hast confirmed to thyself thy people Israel [to be] a people unto thee for ever: and thou, LORD, art become their God.<br><a name="25">25</a>  And now, O LORD God, the word that thou hast spoken concerning thy servant, and concerning his house, establish [it] for ever, and do as thou hast said.<br><a name="26">26</a>  And let thy name be magnified for ever, saying, The LORD of hosts [is] the God over Israel: and let the house of thy servant David be established before thee.<br><a name="27">27</a>  For thou, O LORD of hosts, God of Israel, hast revealed to thy servant, saying, I will build thee an house: therefore hath thy servant found in his heart to pray this prayer unto thee.<br><a name="28">28</a>  And now, O Lord GOD, thou [art] that God, and thy words be true, and thou hast promised this goodness unto thy servant:<br><a name="29">29</a>  Therefore now let it please thee to bless the house of thy servant, that it may continue for ever before thee: for thou, O Lord GOD, hast spoken [it]: and with thy blessing let the house of thy servant be blessed for ever.<br><br>Go to <a href="2sam8.htm#1">II Samuel 8</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
