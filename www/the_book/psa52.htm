Psalms  52<br>1. To the chief Musician, Maschil, [A Psalm] of David, when Doeg the Edomite came and told Saul, and said unto him, David is come to the house of Ahimelech. Why boastest thou thyself in mischief, O mighty man? the goodness of God [endureth] continually.<br><a name="2">2</a>  Thy tongue deviseth mischiefs; like a sharp razor, working deceitfully.<br><a name="3">3</a>  Thou lovest evil more than good; [and] lying rather than to speak righteousness. Selah.<br><a name="4">4</a>  Thou lovest all devouring words, O [thou] deceitful tongue.<br><a name="5">5</a>  God shall likewise destroy thee for ever, he shall take thee away, and pluck thee out of [thy] dwelling place, and root thee out of the land of the living. Selah.<br><a name="6">6</a>. The righteous also shall see, and fear, and shall laugh at him:<br><a name="7">7</a>  Lo, [this is] the man [that] made not God his strength; but trusted in the abundance of his riches, [and] strengthened himself in his wickedness.<br><a name="8">8</a>  But I [am] like a green olive tree in the house of God: I trust in the mercy of God for ever and ever.<br><a name="9">9</a>  I will praise thee for ever, because thou hast done [it]: and I will wait on thy name; for [it is] good before thy saints.<br><br>Go to <a href="psa53.htm#1">Psalm 53</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
