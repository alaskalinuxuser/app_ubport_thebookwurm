Hosea  10<br>1. Israel [is] an empty vine, he bringeth forth fruit unto himself: according to the multitude of his fruit he hath increased the altars; according to the goodness of his land they have made goodly images.<br><a name="2">2</a>  Their heart is divided; now shall they be found faulty: he shall break down their altars, he shall spoil their images.<br><a name="3">3</a>  For now they shall say, We have no king, because we feared not the LORD; what then should a king do to us?<br><a name="4">4</a>  They have spoken words, swearing falsely in making a covenant: thus judgment springeth up as hemlock in the furrows of the field.<br><a name="5">5</a>  The inhabitants of Samaria shall fear because of the calves of Bethaven: for the people thereof shall mourn over it, and the priests thereof [that] rejoiced on it, for the glory thereof, because it is departed from it.<br><a name="6">6</a>  It shall be also carried unto Assyria [for] a present to king Jareb: Ephraim shall receive shame, and Israel shall be ashamed of his own counsel.<br><a name="7">7</a>  [As for] Samaria, her king is cut off as the foam upon the water.<br><a name="8">8</a>  The high places also of Aven, the sin of Israel, shall be destroyed: the thorn and the thistle shall come up on their altars; and they shall say to the mountains, Cover us; and to the hills, Fall on us.<br><a name="9">9</a>. O Israel, thou hast sinned from the days of Gibeah: there they stood: the battle in Gibeah against the children of iniquity did not overtake them.<br><a name="10">10</a>  [It is] in my desire that I should chastise them; and the people shall be gathered against them, when they shall bind themselves in their two furrows.<br><a name="11">11</a>  And Ephraim [is as] an heifer [that is] taught, [and] loveth to tread out [the corn]; but I passed over upon her fair neck: I will make Ephraim to ride; Judah shall plow, [and] Jacob shall break his clods.<br><a name="12">12</a>  Sow to yourselves in righteousness, reap in mercy; break up your fallow ground: for [it is] time to seek the LORD, till he come and rain righteousness upon you.<br><a name="13">13</a>  Ye have plowed wickedness, ye have reaped iniquity; ye have eaten the fruit of lies: because thou didst trust in thy way, in the multitude of thy mighty men.<br><a name="14">14</a>  Therefore shall a tumult arise among thy people, and all thy fortresses shall be spoiled, as Shalman spoiled Betharbel in the day of battle: the mother was dashed in pieces upon [her] children.<br><a name="15">15</a>  So shall Bethel do unto you because of your great wickedness: in a morning shall the king of Israel utterly be cut off.<br><br>Go to <a href="hos11.htm#1">Hosea 11</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
