Psalms  30<br> 1. A Psalm [and] Song [at] the dedication of the house of David. I will extol thee, O LORD; for thou hast lifted me up, and hast not made my foes to rejoice over me.<br><a name="2">2</a>  O LORD my God, I cried unto thee, and thou hast healed me.<br><a name="3">3</a>  O LORD, thou hast brought up my soul from the grave: thou hast kept me alive, that I should not go down to the pit.<br><a name="4">4</a>  Sing unto the LORD, O ye saints of his, and give thanks at the remembrance of his holiness.<br><a name="5">5</a>  For his anger [endureth but] a moment; in his favour [is] life: weeping may endure for a night, but joy [cometh] in the morning.<br><a name="6">6</a>. And in my prosperity I said, I shall never be moved.<br><a name="7">7</a>  LORD, by thy favour thou hast made my mountain to stand strong: thou didst hide thy face, [and] I was troubled.<br><a name="8">8</a>  I cried to thee, O LORD; and unto the LORD I made supplication.<br><a name="9">9</a>  What profit [is there] in my blood, when I go down to the pit? Shall the dust praise thee? shall it declare thy truth?<br><a name="10">10</a>  Hear, O LORD, and have mercy upon me: LORD, be thou my helper.<br><a name="11">11</a>  Thou hast turned for me my mourning into dancing: thou hast put off my sackcloth, and girded me with gladness;<br><a name="12">12</a>  To the end that [my] glory may sing praise to thee, and not be silent. O LORD my God, I will give thanks unto thee for ever.<br><br>Go to <a href="psa31.htm#1">Psalm 31</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
