Isaiah   6<br> 1. In the year that king Uzziah died I saw also the Lord sitting upon a throne, high and lifted up, and his train filled the temple.<br><a name="2">2</a>  Above it stood the seraphims: each one had six wings; with twain he covered his face, and with twain he covered his feet, and with twain he did fly.<br><a name="3">3</a>  And one cried unto another, and said, Holy, holy, holy, [is] the LORD of hosts: the whole earth [is] full of his glory.<br><a name="4">4</a>  And the posts of the door moved at the voice of him that cried, and the house was filled with smoke.<br><a name="5">5</a>. Then said I, Woe [is] me! for I am undone; because I [am] a man of unclean lips, and I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips: for mine eyes have seen the King, the LORD of hosts.<br><a name="6">6</a>  Then flew one of the seraphims unto me, having a live coal in his hand, [which] he had taken with the tongs from off the altar:<br><a name="7">7</a>  And he laid [it] upon my mouth, and said, Lo, this hath touched thy lips; and thine iniquity is taken away, and thy sin purged.<br><a name="8">8</a>  Also I heard the voice of the Lord, saying, Whom shall I send, and who will go for us? Then said I, Here [am] I; send me.<br><a name="9">9</a>. And he said, Go, and tell this people, Hear ye indeed, but understand not; and see ye indeed, but perceive not.<br><a name="10">10</a>  Make the heart of this people fat, and make their ears heavy, and shut their eyes; lest they see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their heart, and convert, and be healed.<br><a name="11">11</a>  Then said I, Lord, how long? And he answered, Until the cities be wasted without inhabitant, and the houses without man, and the land be utterly desolate,<br><a name="12">12</a>  And the LORD have removed men far away, and [there be] a great forsaking in the midst of the land.<br><a name="13">13</a>  But yet in it [shall be] a tenth, and [it] shall return, and shall be eaten: as a teil tree, and as an oak, whose substance [is] in them, when they cast [their leaves: so] the holy seed [shall be] the substance thereof.<br><br>Go to <a href="isa7.htm#1">Isaiah 7</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
