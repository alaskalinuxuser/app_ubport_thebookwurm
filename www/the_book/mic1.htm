Micah   1<br>1. The word of the LORD that came to Micah the Morasthite in the days of Jotham, Ahaz, [and] Hezekiah, kings of Judah, which he saw concerning Samaria and Jerusalem.<br><a name="2">2</a>  Hear, all ye people; hearken, O earth, and all that therein is: and let the Lord GOD be witness against you, the Lord from his holy temple.<br><a name="3">3</a>  For, behold, the LORD cometh forth out of his place, and will come down, and tread upon the high places of the earth.<br><a name="4">4</a>  And the mountains shall be molten under him, and the valleys shall be cleft, as wax before the fire, [and] as the waters [that are] poured down a steep place.<br><a name="5">5</a>  For the transgression of Jacob [is] all this, and for the sins of the house of Israel. What [is] the transgression of Jacob? [is it] not Samaria? and what [are] the high places of Judah? [are they] not Jerusalem?<br><a name="6">6</a>  Therefore I will make Samaria as an heap of the field, [and] as plantings of a vineyard: and I will pour down the stones thereof into the valley, and I will discover the foundations thereof.<br><a name="7">7</a>  And all the graven images thereof shall be beaten to pieces, and all the hires thereof shall be burned with the fire, and all the idols thereof will I lay desolate: for she gathered [it] of the hire of an harlot, and they shall return to the hire of an harlot.<br><a name="8">8</a>. Therefore I will wail and howl, I will go stripped and naked: I will make a wailing like the dragons, and mourning as the owls.<br><a name="9">9</a>  For her wound [is] incurable; for it is come unto Judah; he is come unto the gate of my people, [even] to Jerusalem.<br><a name="10">10</a>  Declare ye [it] not at Gath, weep ye not at all: in the house of Aphrah roll thyself in the dust.<br><a name="11">11</a>  Pass ye away, thou inhabitant of Saphir, having thy shame naked: the inhabitant of Zaanan came not forth in the mourning of Bethezel; he shall receive of you his standing.<br><a name="12">12</a>  For the inhabitant of Maroth waited carefully for good: but evil came down from the LORD unto the gate of Jerusalem.<br><a name="13">13</a>  O thou inhabitant of Lachish, bind the chariot to the swift beast: she [is] the beginning of the sin to the daughter of Zion: for the transgressions of Israel were found in thee.<br><a name="14">14</a>  Therefore shalt thou give presents to Moreshethgath: the houses of Achzib [shall be] a lie to the kings of Israel.<br><a name="15">15</a>  Yet will I bring an heir unto thee, O inhabitant of Mareshah: he shall come unto Adullam the glory of Israel.<br><a name="16">16</a>  Make thee bald, and poll thee for thy delicate children; enlarge thy baldness as the eagle; for they are gone into captivity from thee.<br><br>Go to <a href="mic2.htm#1">Micah 2</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
