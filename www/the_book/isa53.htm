Isaiah  53<br> 1. Who hath believed our report? and to whom is the arm of the LORD revealed?<br><a name="2">2</a>  For he shall grow up before him as a tender plant, and as a root out of a dry ground: he hath no form nor comeliness; and when we shall see him, [there is] no beauty that we should desire him.<br><a name="3">3</a>  He is despised and rejected of men; a man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief: and we hid as it were [our] faces from him; he was despised, and we esteemed him not.<br><a name="4">4</a>. Surely he hath borne our griefs, and carried our sorrows: yet we did esteem him stricken, smitten of God, and afflicted.<br><a name="5">5</a>  But he [was] wounded for our transgressions, [he was] bruised for our iniquities: the chastisement of our peace [was] upon him; and with his stripes we are healed.<br><a name="6">6</a>  All we like sheep have gone astray; we have turned every one to his own way; and the LORD hath laid on him the iniquity of us all.<br><a name="7">7</a>  He was oppressed, and he was afflicted, yet he opened not his mouth: he is brought as a lamb to the slaughter, and as a sheep before her shearers is dumb, so he openeth not his mouth.<br><a name="8">8</a>  He was taken from prison and from judgment: and who shall declare his generation? for he was cut off out of the land of the living: for the transgression of my people was he stricken.<br><a name="9">9</a>  And he made his grave with the wicked, and with the rich in his death; because he had done no violence, neither [was any] deceit in his mouth.<br><a name="10">10</a>. Yet it pleased the LORD to bruise him; he hath put [him] to grief: when thou shalt make his soul an offering for sin, he shall see [his] seed, he shall prolong [his] days, and the pleasure of the LORD shall prosper in his hand.<br><a name="11">11</a>  He shall see of the travail of his soul, [and] shall be satisfied: by his knowledge shall my righteous servant justify many; for he shall bear their iniquities.<br><a name="12">12</a>  Therefore will I divide him [a portion] with the great, and he shall divide the spoil with the strong; because he hath poured out his soul unto death: and he was numbered with the transgressors; and he bare the sin of many, and made intercession for the transgressors.<br><br>Go to <a href="isa54.htm#1">Isaiah 54</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
