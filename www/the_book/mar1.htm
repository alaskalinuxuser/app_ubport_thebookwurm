Mark   1<br>1. The beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God;<br><a name="2">2</a>  As it is written in the prophets, Behold, I send my messenger before thy face, which shall prepare thy way before thee.<br><a name="3">3</a>  The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make his paths straight.<br><a name="4">4</a>  John did baptize in the wilderness, and preach the baptism of repentance for the remission of sins.<br><a name="5">5</a>  And there went out unto him all the land of Judaea, and they of Jerusalem, and were all baptized of him in the river of Jordan, confessing their sins.<br><a name="6">6</a>  And John was clothed with camel's hair, and with a girdle of a skin about his loins; and he did eat locusts and wild honey;<br><a name="7">7</a>  And preached, saying, There cometh one mightier than I after me, the latchet of whose shoes I am not worthy to stoop down and unloose.<br><a name="8">8</a>  I indeed have baptized you with water: but he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost.<br><a name="9">9</a>. And it came to pass in those days, that Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee, and was baptized of John in Jordan.<br><a name="10">10</a>  And straightway coming up out of the water, he saw the heavens opened, and the Spirit like a dove descending upon him:<br><a name="11">11</a>  And there came a voice from heaven, [saying], Thou art my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.<br><a name="12">12</a>  And immediately the Spirit driveth him into the wilderness.<br><a name="13">13</a>  And he was there in the wilderness forty days, tempted of Satan; and was with the wild beasts; and the angels ministered unto him.<br><a name="14">14</a>. Now after that John was put in prison, Jesus came into Galilee, preaching the gospel of the kingdom of God,<br><a name="15">15</a>  And saying, The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand: repent ye, and believe the gospel.<br><a name="16">16</a>  Now as he walked by the sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and Andrew his brother casting a net into the sea: for they were fishers.<br><a name="17">17</a>  And Jesus said unto them, Come ye after me, and I will make you to become fishers of men.<br><a name="18">18</a>  And straightway they forsook their nets, and followed him.<br><a name="19">19</a>  And when he had gone a little further thence, he saw James the [son] of Zebedee, and John his brother, who also were in the ship mending their nets.<br><a name="20">20</a>  And straightway he called them: and they left their father Zebedee in the ship with the hired servants, and went after him.<br><a name="21">21</a>  And they went into Capernaum; and straightway on the sabbath day he entered into the synagogue, and taught.<br><a name="22">22</a>  And they were astonished at his doctrine: for he taught them as one that had authority, and not as the scribes.<br><a name="23">23</a>. And there was in their synagogue a man with an unclean spirit; and he cried out,<br><a name="24">24</a>  Saying, Let [us] alone; what have we to do with thee, thou Jesus of Nazareth? art thou come to destroy us? I know thee who thou art, the Holy One of God.<br><a name="25">25</a>  And Jesus rebuked him, saying, Hold thy peace, and come out of him.<br><a name="26">26</a>  And when the unclean spirit had torn him, and cried with a loud voice, he came out of him.<br><a name="27">27</a>  And they were all amazed, insomuch that they questioned among themselves, saying, What thing is this? what new doctrine [is] this? for with authority commandeth he even the unclean spirits, and they do obey him.<br><a name="28">28</a>  And immediately his fame spread abroad throughout all the region round about Galilee.<br><a name="29">29</a>. And forthwith, when they were come out of the synagogue, they entered into the house of Simon and Andrew, with James and John.<br><a name="30">30</a>  But Simon's wife's mother lay sick of a fever, and anon they tell him of her.<br><a name="31">31</a>  And he came and took her by the hand, and lifted her up; and immediately the fever left her, and she ministered unto them.<br><a name="32">32</a>  And at even, when the sun did set, they brought unto him all that were diseased, and them that were possessed with devils.<br><a name="33">33</a>  And all the city was gathered together at the door.<br><a name="34">34</a>  And he healed many that were sick of divers diseases, and cast out many devils; and suffered not the devils to speak, because they knew him.<br><a name="35">35</a>  And in the morning, rising up a great while before day, he went out, and departed into a solitary place, and there prayed.<br><a name="36">36</a>  And Simon and they that were with him followed after him.<br><a name="37">37</a>  And when they had found him, they said unto him, All [men] seek for thee.<br><a name="38">38</a>  And he said unto them, Let us go into the next towns, that I may preach there also: for therefore came I forth.<br><a name="39">39</a>  And he preached in their synagogues throughout all Galilee, and cast out devils.<br><a name="40">40</a>. And there came a leper to him, beseeching him, and kneeling down to him, and saying unto him, If thou wilt, thou canst make me clean.<br><a name="41">41</a>  And Jesus, moved with compassion, put forth [his] hand, and touched him, and saith unto him, I will; be thou clean.<br><a name="42">42</a>  And as soon as he had spoken, immediately the leprosy departed from him, and he was cleansed.<br><a name="43">43</a>  And he straitly charged him, and forthwith sent him away;<br><a name="44">44</a>  And saith unto him, See thou say nothing to any man: but go thy way, shew thyself to the priest, and offer for thy cleansing those things which Moses commanded, for a testimony unto them.<br><a name="45">45</a>  But he went out, and began to publish [it] much, and to blaze abroad the matter, insomuch that Jesus could no more openly enter into the city, but was without in desert places: and they came to him from every quarter.<br><br>Go to <a href="mar2.htm#1">Mark 2</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
