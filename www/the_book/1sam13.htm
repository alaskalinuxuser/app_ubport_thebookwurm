1Samuel  13<br>1. Saul reigned one year; and when he had reigned two years over Israel,<br><a name="2">2</a>  Saul chose him three thousand [men] of Israel; [whereof] two thousand were with Saul in Michmash and in mount Bethel, and a thousand were with Jonathan in Gibeah of Benjamin: and the rest of the people he sent every man to his tent.<br><a name="3">3</a>  And Jonathan smote the garrison of the Philistines that [was] in Geba, and the Philistines heard [of it]. And Saul blew the trumpet throughout all the land, saying, Let the Hebrews hear.<br><a name="4">4</a>  And all Israel heard say [that] Saul had smitten a garrison of the Philistines, and [that] Israel also was had in abomination with the Philistines. And the people were called together after Saul to Gilgal.<br><a name="5">5</a>  And the Philistines gathered themselves together to fight with Israel, thirty thousand chariots, and six thousand horsemen, and people as the sand which [is] on the sea shore in multitude: and they came up, and pitched in Michmash, eastward from Bethaven.<br><a name="6">6</a>  When the men of Israel saw that they were in a strait, (for the people were distressed,) then the people did hide themselves in caves, and in thickets, and in rocks, and in high places, and in pits.<br><a name="7">7</a>  And [some of] the Hebrews went over Jordan to the land of Gad and Gilead. As for Saul, he [was] yet in Gilgal, and all the people followed him trembling.<br><a name="8">8</a>. And he tarried seven days, according to the set time that Samuel [had appointed]: but Samuel came not to Gilgal; and the people were scattered from him.<br><a name="9">9</a>  And Saul said, Bring hither a burnt offering to me, and peace offerings. And he offered the burnt offering.<br><a name="10">10</a>  And it came to pass, that as soon as he had made an end of offering the burnt offering, behold, Samuel came; and Saul went out to meet him, that he might salute him.<br><a name="11">11</a>  And Samuel said, What hast thou done? And Saul said, Because I saw that the people were scattered from me, and [that] thou camest not within the days appointed, and [that] the Philistines gathered themselves together at Michmash;<br><a name="12">12</a>  Therefore said I, The Philistines will come down now upon me to Gilgal, and I have not made supplication unto the LORD: I forced myself therefore, and offered a burnt offering.<br><a name="13">13</a>  And Samuel said to Saul, Thou hast done foolishly: thou hast not kept the commandment of the LORD thy God, which he commanded thee: for now would the LORD have established thy kingdom upon Israel for ever.<br><a name="14">14</a>  But now thy kingdom shall not continue: the LORD hath sought him a man after his own heart, and the LORD hath commanded him [to be] captain over his people, because thou hast not kept [that] which the LORD commanded thee.<br><a name="15">15</a>. And Samuel arose, and gat him up from Gilgal unto Gibeah of Benjamin. And Saul numbered the people [that were] present with him, about six hundred men.<br><a name="16">16</a>  And Saul, and Jonathan his son, and the people [that were] present with them, abode in Gibeah of Benjamin: but the Philistines encamped in Michmash.<br><a name="17">17</a>  And the spoilers came out of the camp of the Philistines in three companies: one company turned unto the way [that leadeth to] Ophrah, unto the land of Shual:<br><a name="18">18</a>  And another company turned the way [to] Bethhoron: and another company turned [to] the way of the border that looketh to the valley of Zeboim toward the wilderness.<br><a name="19">19</a>  Now there was no smith found throughout all the land of Israel: for the Philistines said, Lest the Hebrews make [them] swords or spears:<br><a name="20">20</a>  But all the Israelites went down to the Philistines, to sharpen every man his share, and his coulter, and his axe, and his mattock.<br><a name="21">21</a>  Yet they had a file for the mattocks, and for the coulters, and for the forks, and for the axes, and to sharpen the goads.<br><a name="22">22</a>  So it came to pass in the day of battle, that there was neither sword nor spear found in the hand of any of the people that [were] with Saul and Jonathan: but with Saul and with Jonathan his son was there found.<br><a name="23">23</a>  And the garrison of the Philistines went out to the passage of Michmash.<br><br>Go to <a href="1sam14.htm#1">I Samuel 14</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
