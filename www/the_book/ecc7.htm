Ecclesiastes   7<br> 1. A good name [is] better than precious ointment; and the day of death than the day of one's birth.<br><a name="2">2</a>  [It is] better to go to the house of mourning, than to go to the house of feasting: for that [is] the end of all men; and the living will lay [it] to his heart.<br><a name="3">3</a>  Sorrow [is] better than laughter: for by the sadness of the countenance the heart is made better.<br><a name="4">4</a>  The heart of the wise [is] in the house of mourning; but the heart of fools [is] in the house of mirth.<br><a name="5">5</a>  [It is] better to hear the rebuke of the wise, than for a man to hear the song of fools.<br><a name="6">6</a>  For as the crackling of thorns under a pot, so [is] the laughter of the fool: this also [is] vanity.<br><a name="7">7</a>. Surely oppression maketh a wise man mad; and a gift destroyeth the heart.<br><a name="8">8</a>  Better [is] the end of a thing than the beginning thereof: [and] the patient in spirit [is] better than the proud in spirit.<br><a name="9">9</a>  Be not hasty in thy spirit to be angry: for anger resteth in the bosom of fools.<br><a name="10">10</a>  Say not thou, What is [the cause] that the former days were better than these? for thou dost not enquire wisely concerning this.<br><a name="11">11</a>. Wisdom [is] good with an inheritance: and [by it there is] profit to them that see the sun.<br><a name="12">12</a>  For wisdom [is] a defence, [and] money [is] a defence: but the excellency of knowledge [is, that] wisdom giveth life to them that have it.<br><a name="13">13</a>  Consider the work of God: for who can make [that] straight, which he hath made crooked?<br><a name="14">14</a>  In the day of prosperity be joyful, but in the day of adversity consider: God also hath set the one over against the other, to the end that man should find nothing after him.<br><a name="15">15</a>  All [things] have I seen in the days of my vanity: there is a just [man] that perisheth in his righteousness, and there is a wicked [man] that prolongeth [his life] in his wickedness.<br><a name="16">16</a>  Be not righteous over much; neither make thyself over wise: why shouldest thou destroy thyself?<br><a name="17">17</a>  Be not over much wicked, neither be thou foolish: why shouldest thou die before thy time?<br><a name="18">18</a>  [It is] good that thou shouldest take hold of this; yea, also from this withdraw not thine hand: for he that feareth God shall come forth of them all.<br><a name="19">19</a>  Wisdom strengtheneth the wise more than ten mighty [men] which are in the city.<br><a name="20">20</a>  For [there is] not a just man upon earth, that doeth good, and sinneth not.<br><a name="21">21</a>  Also take no heed unto all words that are spoken; lest thou hear thy servant curse thee:<br><a name="22">22</a>  For oftentimes also thine own heart knoweth that thou thyself likewise hast cursed others.<br><a name="23">23</a>. All this have I proved by wisdom: I said, I will be wise; but it [was] far from me.<br><a name="24">24</a>  That which is far off, and exceeding deep, who can find it out?<br><a name="25">25</a>  I applied mine heart to know, and to search, and to seek out wisdom, and the reason [of things], and to know the wickedness of folly, even of foolishness [and] madness:<br><a name="26">26</a>  And I find more bitter than death the woman, whose heart [is] snares and nets, [and] her hands [as] bands: whoso pleaseth God shall escape from her; but the sinner shall be taken by her.<br><a name="27">27</a>  Behold, this have I found, saith the preacher, [counting] one by one, to find out the account:<br><a name="28">28</a>  Which yet my soul seeketh, but I find not: one man among a thousand have I found; but a woman among all those have I not found.<br><a name="29">29</a>  Lo, this only have I found, that God hath made man upright; but they have sought out many inventions.<br><br>Go to <a href="ecc8.htm#1">Ecclesiastes 8</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
