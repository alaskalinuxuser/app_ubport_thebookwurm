Proverbs  17<br>1. Better [is] a dry morsel, and quietness therewith, than an house full of sacrifices [with] strife.<br><a name="2">2</a>. A wise servant shall have rule over a son that causeth shame, and shall have part of the inheritance among the brethren.<br><a name="3">3</a>. The fining pot [is] for silver, and the furnace for gold: but the LORD trieth the hearts.<br><a name="4">4</a>. A wicked doer giveth heed to false lips; [and] a liar giveth ear to a naughty tongue.<br><a name="5">5</a>. Whoso mocketh the poor reproacheth his Maker: [and] he that is glad at calamities shall not be unpunished.<br><a name="6">6</a>. Children's children [are] the crown of old men; and the glory of children [are] their fathers.<br><a name="7">7</a>. Excellent speech becometh not a fool: much less do lying lips a prince.<br><a name="8">8</a>. A gift [is as] a precious stone in the eyes of him that hath it: whithersoever it turneth, it prospereth.<br><a name="9">9</a>. He that covereth a transgression seeketh love; but he that repeateth a matter separateth [very] friends.<br><a name="10">10</a>. A reproof entereth more into a wise man than an hundred stripes into a fool.<br><a name="11">11</a>. An evil [man] seeketh only rebellion: therefore a cruel messenger shall be sent against him.<br><a name="12">12</a>. Let a bear robbed of her whelps meet a man, rather than a fool in his folly.<br><a name="13">13</a>. Whoso rewardeth evil for good, evil shall not depart from his house.<br><a name="14">14</a>. The beginning of strife [is as] when one letteth out water: therefore leave off contention, before it be meddled with.<br><a name="15">15</a>. He that justifieth the wicked, and he that condemneth the just, even they both [are] abomination to the LORD.<br><a name="16">16</a>. Wherefore [is there] a price in the hand of a fool to get wisdom, seeing [he hath] no heart [to it]?<br><a name="17">17</a>. A friend loveth at all times, and a brother is born for adversity.<br><a name="18">18</a>. A man void of understanding striketh hands, [and] becometh surety in the presence of his friend.<br><a name="19">19</a>. He loveth transgression that loveth strife: [and] he that exalteth his gate seeketh destruction.<br><a name="20">20</a>. He that hath a froward heart findeth no good: and he that hath a perverse tongue falleth into mischief.<br><a name="21">21</a>. He that begetteth a fool [doeth it] to his sorrow: and the father of a fool hath no joy.<br><a name="22">22</a>. A merry heart doeth good [like] a medicine: but a broken spirit drieth the bones.<br><a name="23">23</a>. A wicked [man] taketh a gift out of the bosom to pervert the ways of judgment.<br><a name="24">24</a>. Wisdom [is] before him that hath understanding; but the eyes of a fool [are] in the ends of the earth.<br><a name="25">25</a>. A foolish son [is] a grief to his father, and bitterness to her that bare him.<br><a name="26">26</a>. Also to punish the just [is] not good, [nor] to strike princes for equity.<br><a name="27">27</a>. He that hath knowledge spareth his words: [and] a man of understanding is of an excellent spirit.<br><a name="28">28</a>  Even a fool, when he holdeth his peace, is counted wise: [and] he that shutteth his lips [is esteemed] a man of understanding.<br><br>Go to <a href="pro18.htm#1">Proverbs 18</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
