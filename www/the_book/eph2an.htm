<dl><dt>
Our position of privilege and blessing, in God's Beloved Son, is something that we only barely begin to appreciate. Therefore, in Ephesians ch. 1, Paul prayed that we would understand the richness of the blessing which we have received in Christ. Let's review his prayer, before moving into the next chapter.  
<dd>Paul prays (in <a href="eph1.htm#15">Eph 1:15-23</a>) that we would comprehend...<ul>
<li><a href="eph1.htm#17">v.17</a> - what belongs to us as God's children, through coming to a precise and correct knowledge of God's Son, the Lord Jesus Christ.
<li><a href="eph1.htm#18">v.18a</a> - the hope (or expectation) of the glorious state into which we have been called (invited).
<li>v.18b - the riches (or abundance) of the glorious state of the saints (holy ones) who are God's own inheritance (ie., His received and treasured possessions).
<li><a href="eph1.htm#19">v.19</a> - the exceeding {GK=huperballo, surpassing beyond anything known} greatness of His power...<ul>
<li>toward us
<li>which God wrought, in Christ
<li>when He raised Him from the dead
<li>set Him at His own right hand<ul>
<li>far above all entities, spiritual and fleshly, in this world and the next.</ul>
<li>put all things under His feet (under His dominion).
<li>gave Him to be the Head of the church, His body...<br>
...the fulness (ie., the completion, the complement) of Him that filleth (brings to completion) all in all (everything whatsoever). <br>
The church as the bride of Christ... will share...<br>
... the glories of His Home (the Father's House)<br>
... His victory over every enemy<br>
... vital union with God the Son.<br>It is beyond imagination to think that we should be one with Him... a help meet for Him. <a href="gen2.htm#18">Gen 2:18</a></ul></ul></ul>
<dt>Do you begin to get a sense of the glory of the Beloved Son? the One in whom we have been blessed beyond measure, and to whom we are joined? 
<p>Now, there is a very sudden change in the picture on the page. For between chapter 1 and 2, our eyes drop from the gloriously rich perfections of heaven, to the wretched condition of mankind... The condition in which the Savior found us, when He came to seek and to save the lost.</p>
<p>Notice the italicized words in <a href="eph2.htm#1" target="lwr_lt">2:1</a> [bracketed in the text displayed on this website]. These words were inserted by the translators in this position, to help us grasp a long and difficult sentence. <a href="eph2.htm#1" target="lwr_lt">Verses 1-7</a> form one sentence in the Greek. The translators chose to break the sentence into two (v.1-3; v.4-7) to help our English speaking minds process a complex thought. The italicized words in v.1 were copied from v.5 to tie the thought together. Their presence in v.1 enables us to see where the long sentence is going. But their absence, in the original, draws a very sharp contrast between the glories of the risen Savior and the absolute worthlessness and hopelessness in which He found us...</p><dt>
<b><i>1. And you [hath he quickened], who were dead in trespasses and sins;<br>
2 Wherein in time past ye walked according to the course of this world,<br>according to the prince of the power of the air,<br>the spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedience:<br>
3 Among whom also we all had our conversation in times past in the lusts of our flesh,<br>fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the mind;<br>and were by nature the children of wrath, even as others.</b></i></dt><dl>
<dt>And you... (omit &quot;hath he quickened&quot;)...</dt><dl>
<dt>...who were dead... - Death is separation. Separation from life. Separation from God.<dd>The dead have no strength or ability in themselves. They cannot hear... They cannot respond... They cannot obey  the Word of God. Only the Holy Spirit can get through to a dead heart. <a href="joh16.htm#8">Joh 16:8</a>
<dt>...in trespasses {stepping over the boundaries} -<dd>We, like Adam & Eve, refuse to accept the restrictions which God has set upon us. When we hear Him say &quot;Thou shalt not...&quot; that is exactly what we want to do.
<dt>...and sins {missing the mark} - We like to think that we measure up...<dd>that we are not so bad... that we are better than many others.<br>But we all fall short of God's standard of righteousness. We may know what is right, and may even want to do it, but we do something else. We cannot please God, because we are dead toward Him.
<dt>...wherein ye walked...-  Yet, while being dead toward God,<dd>we had strength enough to walk in the ways of the world. The walking dead walk...</dt><dl>
<dt>...according to the prince of the power of the air... -<dd>We walked in the ways of Satan, whose authority holds sway over mankind, and the human world order.
<dt>...the spirit that now worketh in {energizes} the children of disobedience.-<dd>For what does the evil spirit enable those who are dead toward God? for disobedience {GK=apeitheia, unbelief, obstinate opposition to the will of God}.
<dt>...among whom also we had our conversation...-<dd>Our way of life was just like the rest of those who are dead in trespasses and sins: for the purpose of self-indulgence and self-satisfaction of physical pleasures and of evil imaginations. We were by nature {from birth, from our springing forth} the children of wrath. As the Lord found us, we were were completely swallowed up in worldly desires (<a href="1joh2.htm#15">1Joh 2:15-17</a>) and worthy only of His hot anger (<a href="eph5.htm#5">Eph 5:5,6</a>).</dl></dl></dl>
<dt><b><i>4. But God, who is rich in mercy, for his great love wherewith he loved us,<br>
5 Even when we were dead in sins, hath quickened us together <u>with Christ</u>,<br>(by grace ye are saved;)<br>
6 And hath raised [us] up together,<br>and made [us] sit together in heavenly [places] <u>in Christ Jesus</u>:<br>
7 That in the ages to come he might shew the exceeding riches of his grace<br>in [his] kindness toward us <u>through Christ Jesus</u>.</b></i></dt><dl>
<dt> But God... -<dd>God did for us...<ul>
<li>what we did not deserve (<a href="eph2.htm#4" target="lwr_lt">v.4</a>)- acting from the richness of His mercy and the greatness of His love.
<li>what we could not do for ourselves (<a href="eph2.htm#5" target="lwr_lt">v.5</a>)- The dead cannot lift themselves out of the muck.<ul>
<li>He quickened us {ie., made us alive} with Christ
<li>He raised us, up out of our wretched condition, to be elevated far above all things together with Christ.</ul>
<li>that which will forever demonstrate the exceeding {GK=huperballo, surpassing beyond anything known) riches of His grace and kindness {benevolent goodness}.<ul>
<li>The exceeding greatness of His grace toward us...<ul>
<li>was that which He &quot;wrought in Christ&quot; by the &quot;the exceeding greatness of His power...&quot; &quot;when He raised Christ from the dead.&quot; (<a href="eph1.htm#19">Eph 1:19,20</a>)
<li>is that which saves us. God's rich mercy and His great love, even working together, could not save us. Mercy desires to put the offense away. Love desires what is best for the one loved.<br> 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But God is also Just. He could not simply say: &quot;You are forgiven,&quot; while both He and we knew the depth of our willful disobedience and guilt.<br> 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God is also Holy. He could not allow us to live in His presence while we were dead toward Him, and living in worldly excesses.</ul></ul></dl>
<dt>
<b><i>8 For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves:<br>[it is] the gift of God:<br>
9 Not of works, lest any man should boast.<br>
10 For we are his workmanship, created <u>in Christ Jesus</u> unto good works,<br>which God hath before ordained that we should walk in them.</b></i></dt><dl>
<dt>For by grace are ye saved...- &quot;Grace is favor bestowed on the unworthy and undeserving.&quot; [JVMcGee]
<dd>Grace is the favor which Christ purchased for us, by His death for our sins, and by His resurrection to raise us up to live with Him.
<dd>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Note that salvation is in the present tense. Those who truly trust in the finished work of Christ are saved. The work of Grace which God wrought in Christ (<a href="eph1.htm#20">1:20</a>) is finished. Even though Christ's bride still walks upon this earth, awaiting His return, she is already lifted up far above her former condition. Note that the present state of the saints is spoken of in the past tense:<ul>
<li><a href="eph2.htm#1" target="lwr_lt">v.1</a> (italics), <a href="eph2.htm#5" target="lwr_lt">v.5</a> &quot;You hath He quickened.&quot; He has already given us new life.  
<li><a href="eph2.htm#6" target="lwr_lt">v.6</a> &quot;and hath raised us up together and made us sit together...&quot; in Christ Jesus.</ul>
There is nothing left for you to do, to earn the salvation that God has provided, in Christ...
<dt>...it is the gift of God... not of works, lest any man should boast.
<dd>A gift cannot be earned, for then it would either be a wage or a reward, for work that we have done. None of us is worthy of God's favor. There is nothing that we can do to earn it. All that remains is to receive God's gift of salvation, by trusting in Christ and what He has done for you. 
<dt>...through faith; and that not of yourselves...-<dd>But a dead person has no power. God offers us salvation as a free gift. But we cannot receive it, because we lack the ability to believe.
<dd>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My earthly father related a dream that he had, late in his life. He dreamt that he had gone to heaven. There were many people there. But he saw no one that he knew. He did meet some people that he had read about in the Bible. The thief, who repented on the cross next to Jesus, was there. But he could not find anyone from his own family... his father and mother and sisters... When he awoke he was grieving that he had let his loved ones down. They had been religious people, who were familiar with the Bible. But they were trusting in their good works. Had he failed to make the Gospel clear... that salvation is a gift received by faith, not by works of righteousness which we have done? That is a question we all need to ask ourselves. Yet, every man is accountable to God, who makes His Word readily available to all, and who sends many witnesses to the lost. So, that everyone is without excuse. 
<dt>Someone will say: 'I am not saved because God has not given me faith.'<dd>But would He withhold faith from you, when He has done everything to bring you out of death into life? The God who is rich in mercy, and whose great love sent His Beloved Son to purchase our salvation with His own blood, is surely willing to grant you the faith to receive it. cp. <a href="rom8.htm#32">Rom 8:32</a><br>
How does one get faith?<ul>
<li>&quot;Faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the Word of God&quot; (<a href="rom10.htm#17">Rom 10:17</a>). If you will take the Bible for what it is, the Word of God, and pay attention to what it says, it will lead you to Christ.
<li>&quot;Lord, Help thou mine unbelief...&quot; (<a href="mar9.htm#23">Mark 9:23,24</a>)  If you will confess your doubts to Him, asking Him to help your unbelief, He will answer your prayer, and provide answers to your questions.
<li>&quot;When it (ie., the blinded heart and mind) shall turn to the Lord, the vail shall be taken away.&quot; (<a href="2cor3.htm#14">2Cor 3:14-16</a>)    When you see your need of Him, and turn to Him, He will enable you to understand and receive His Word. </ul>
<dt>For we are His workmanship, created in Christ Jesus...
<dd>The salvation which God accomplished for us, through the finished work of Christ on the cross, is given freely to all who will receive it by faith. Yet, this is only the beginning, of the blessings which come to the believer through the Grace of God. The believer enters into something entirely new and glorious.<ul>
<li>Every believer is a new creation, a new creature (<a href="2cor5.htm#17">2Cor 5:17</a>; <a href="joh3.htm#3">Joh 3:3-6</a>).<br>See this word 'created' in <a href="col1.htm#16">Col 1:16</a> (God created, out of nothing, the universe and everything in it.);<br>and also in <a href="col3.htm#10">Col 3:10</a> (God creates, out of the dead nothingness within the believer, a new nature, which is, 'made in the image of Him that created him.').
<li>All believers together (we) are His 'workmanship' {GK=poiema, that which has been made}. The only other occurrence of this word is in <a href="rom1.htm#20">Rom 1:20</a>, regarding the present created order. The church is &quot;His new creation.&quot;</ul>
<dd>God's purpose for His new creatures - That we should walk in good works (not according to our old worldly ways).<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;See the usage of the word 'good' in <a href="mat12.htm#35">Mat 12:35</a>; <a href="mat19.htm#16">19:16-17</a>.<ul> 
<li>Good works come from the new nature, &quot;made in the image of Him that created him.&quot; 
<li>Good works are &quot;before ordained&quot; {ie., prepared ahead of time}, as the walk, or way of life, which characterizes those who are alive in Christ (<a href="eph1.htm#4">Eph 1:4,5</a>). Ephesians ch. 4-5 describe, in very practical terms, what that walk ought to look like, for believers who are still walking on the earth (<a href="eph4.htm#1">4:1</a>; <a href="eph5.htm#1">5:1,2</a>).</ul></dl>
<dt><b><i>11. Wherefore remember, that ye [being] in time past Gentiles in the flesh,<br>who are called Uncircumcision<br>by that which is called the Circumcision in the flesh made by hands;<br>
12 That at that time ye were without Christ,<br>being aliens from the commonwealth of Israel,<br>and strangers from the covenants of promise,<br>having no hope, and without God in the world:<br>
13 But now <u>in Christ Jesus</u><br>ye who sometimes were far off are made nigh by the blood of Christ.</b></i></dt><dl>
<dt>wherefore...- In consideration of what has been said, in the preceding verses...<ul>
<li>Our Savior, who has been exalted to glory far exceeding anything that we can imagine (<a href="eph1.htm#15">1:15-23</a>).
<li>The terrible contrast, between Him in His glory, and ourselves in the filth in which He found us: dead in sins... separated from God... powerless to lift ourselves out of our depravity. (<a href="eph2.htm#1" target="lwr_lt">2:1-3</a>)
<li>The greatness of God's mercy and love, by which He extended Grace to us... favor which was totally undeserved... purchased by Christ, who took our sin and death upon Himself, so that we could be clothed in His righteousness, and raised up, with Christ, out of our deadness, to life in the Presence of God, and to live for the Purposes that God has for us (<a href="eph2.htm#4" target="lwr_lt">2:4-10</a>).</ul>
<dt>remember... - Here is something more for the Ephesian believers to consider.
<dd>You were Gentiles.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of all that Christ has done for us, by His shed blood, and in His resurrection, we Gentiles have been brought into a new relationship with God... a place of blessing and favor, which was formerly reserved for Israel (<a href="rom9.htm#4">Rom 9:4-5</a>). Circumcision was the external token of the covenant, by which the Jewish people enjoyed a relationship with God. The light of God's Word shined upon them (<a href="rom3.htm#1">Rom 3:1,2</a>), although many failed to see it. But, with few exceptions, Gentiles were shut out, excluded from the company of the chosen people, and in darkness concerning Israel's True and Living God, and what He requires of men.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;But now in Christ Jesus ye who sometimes {ie., in time past, formerly} were far off are made nigh by the blood of Christ&quot; (<a href="eph2.htm#13" target="lwr_lt">v.13</a>).</dl><dt>
<dt><b><i>14. For he is our peace, who hath made both one,<br>and hath broken down the middle wall of partition [between us];<br>
15 Having abolished in his flesh the enmity,<br>[even] the law of commandments [contained] in ordinances;<br>for to make <u>in himself</u> of twain one new man, [so] making peace;<br>
16 And that he might reconcile both unto God in one body by the cross,<br>having slain the enmity thereby:<br>
17 And came and preached peace to you which were afar off, and to them that were nigh.<br>
18 For through him we both have access by one Spirit unto the Father.</b></i></dt><dl>
<dt>Christ has broken down the middle wall of partition between us...
<dd>Between who?<ul> 
<li>Between Jew and Gentile?<ul>
<li>Yes... for He would make &quot;one new man,&quot; ie., the body of Christ, the Church, consisting of believers called out from among both the Jewish nation and the Gentile nations. &quot;The Gospel of Christ is the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth; to the Jew first, and also to the Greek.&quot; (<a href="rom1.htm#16">Rom 1:16</a>; <a href="rom3.htm#22">3:22-24</a>; <a href="rom10.htm#12">10:12,13</a>)
<li>Yes... for Christ, took those who formerly regarded one another with suspicion and animosity, and joined them together in and around Himself, &quot;so making peace.&quot; Today, while hatred rages between Palestinian Arabs and their Israeli neighbors, there are churches in Israel where Arabs and Jews meet together, in loving harmony, around the Lord's Table.</ul>
<li>But also... and especially... Between God and man.<ul>
<li>In Christ, the one body (consisting of Jew and Gentile believers) is reconciled to God. Before Christ came, to make reconcilation between God and man, both Jews and Gentiles were shut out of God's presence due to sin (<a href="isa59.htm#2">Isa 59:2</a>). There was a wall of partition between God and all men, of every race and creed. The Gentiles, with little knowledge of God's Word were &quot;afar off.&quot; Jews were nigh, because they had God's Word. Remember what Jesus said to the Jewish scribe who answered Him discreetly, and with knowledge of the scriptures? &quot;Thou art not far from the kingdom of God&quot; (<a href="mar12.htm#28">Mark 12:28-34</a>). But &quot;not far&quot; is not close enough for entrance. For &quot;Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God.&quot; (<a href="joh3.htm#3">Joh 3:3</a>; <a href="mat5.htm#20">Mat 5:20</a>)
<li>Those who are born of God's Spirit have access unto the Father. They are brought near to Him and also near to each other, for there is but one Holy Spirit. <a href="eph4.htm#4">Eph 4:4-6</a></ul></ul>
<dd>He is our peace...- <a href="rom5.htm#1">Rom 5:1</a></dl><dt>
<b><i>19 Now therefore ye are no more strangers and foreigners,<br>but fellowcitizens with the saints, and of the household of God;<br>
20 And are built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets,<br>Jesus Christ himself being the chief corner [stone];<br>
21 <u>In whom</u> all the building fitly framed together groweth unto an holy temple in the Lord:<br>
22 <u>In whom</u> ye also are builded together for an habitation of God through the Spirit.</b></i></dt><dl>
<dt>Now therefore... - For all who are in Christ...
<dd>It is not merely that Jew and Gentile have been brought together in one body... but that there is &quot;One God and Father of all (believers), who is above all (of us), and through all, and in you all.&quot; (<a href="eph4.htm#6">Eph 4:6</a>)<ul>
<li>We are fellow citizens of Christ's Kingdom.
<li>We belong to one family, as God's children, we are brothers and sisters, related by the blood of Christ.
<li>We have a common foundation: God's Word (communicated through the apostles and prophets).
<li>We are individual pieces, joined together, in the one Temple which God is building. Christ Himself is the corner stone from whom the whole building is referenced, and around whom the structure is closely integrated. Being tightly connected to Him, every member is also drawn together to each other, in Him who lives within us. cp. <a href="1pet2.htm#5">1Pet 2:5-8</a></ul>
<p>This vital union of all believers in the body of Christ will also be compared to the union of Christ to His Bride, the Church (in <a href="eph5.htm#21">Eph 5:21-33</a>). As the Church, the Bride is joined to Christ and fully submitted to Him, so, the individual members of the Bride must be submitted to Him, and also to each other (Eph 5:21).</p>
<p>What a high and privileged relationship! We, who were dead in our trespasses and sins, have been lifted up, raised out of our filth and death to be joined to God's Beloved Son, the glorious King, as His Bride, His Queen. How can it be?!</p>
<p>How is it that we allow ourselves to become distracted from Him and irritated with each other? How can the Bride's eye, ear, hand or foot be in conflict with one another, when we are one with the great King?</p>
<p>Isn't it because our affections are set on the things of earth (power struggles, money, buildings, possessions, friends, even church stuff...) rather than on the things above? (<a href="col3.htm#1">Col 3:1-4</a>)  'When He shall appear...' Are you listening for His shout?  Are you listening to His still small voice, as you watch and wait? (He is speaking, today, to those who listen, through His written Word and by His Spirit.)</p>
