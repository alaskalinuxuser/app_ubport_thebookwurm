Exodus  40<br>1. And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,<br><a name="2">2</a>  On the first day of the first month shalt thou set up the tabernacle of the tent of the congregation.<br><a name="3">3</a>  And thou shalt put therein the ark of the testimony, and cover the ark with the vail.<br><a name="4">4</a>  And thou shalt bring in the table, and set in order the things that are to be set in order upon it; and thou shalt bring in the candlestick, and light the lamps thereof.<br><a name="5">5</a>  And thou shalt set the altar of gold for the incense before the ark of the testimony, and put the hanging of the door to the tabernacle.<br><a name="6">6</a>  And thou shalt set the altar of the burnt offering before the door of the tabernacle of the tent of the congregation.<br><a name="7">7</a>  And thou shalt set the laver between the tent of the congregation and the altar, and shalt put water therein.<br><a name="8">8</a>  And thou shalt set up the court round about, and hang up the hanging at the court gate.<br><a name="9">9</a>  And thou shalt take the anointing oil, and anoint the tabernacle, and all that [is] therein, and shalt hallow it, and all the vessels thereof: and it shall be holy.<br><a name="10">10</a>  And thou shalt anoint the altar of the burnt offering, and all his vessels, and sanctify the altar: and it shall be an altar most holy.<br><a name="11">11</a>  And thou shalt anoint the laver and his foot, and sanctify it.<br><a name="12">12</a>  And thou shalt bring Aaron and his sons unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, and wash them with water.<br><a name="13">13</a>  And thou shalt put upon Aaron the holy garments, and anoint him, and sanctify him; that he may minister unto me in the priest's office.<br><a name="14">14</a>  And thou shalt bring his sons, and clothe them with coats:<br><a name="15">15</a>  And thou shalt anoint them, as thou didst anoint their father, that they may minister unto me in the priest's office: for their anointing shall surely be an everlasting priesthood throughout their generations.<br><a name="16">16</a>. Thus did Moses: according to all that the LORD commanded him, so did he.<br><a name="17">17</a>  And it came to pass in the first month in the second year, on the first [day] of the month, [that] the tabernacle was reared up.<br><a name="18">18</a>  And Moses reared up the tabernacle, and fastened his sockets, and set up the boards thereof, and put in the bars thereof, and reared up his pillars.<br><a name="19">19</a>  And he spread abroad the tent over the tabernacle, and put the covering of the tent above upon it; as the LORD commanded Moses.<br><a name="20">20</a>  And he took and put the testimony into the ark, and set the staves on the ark, and put the mercy seat above upon the ark:<br><a name="21">21</a>  And he brought the ark into the tabernacle, and set up the vail of the covering, and covered the ark of the testimony; as the LORD commanded Moses.<br><a name="22">22</a>  And he put the table in the tent of the congregation, upon the side of the tabernacle northward, without the vail.<br><a name="23">23</a>  And he set the bread in order upon it before the LORD; as the LORD had commanded Moses.<br><a name="24">24</a>  And he put the candlestick in the tent of the congregation, over against the table, on the side of the tabernacle southward.<br><a name="25">25</a>  And he lighted the lamps before the LORD; as the LORD commanded Moses.<br><a name="26">26</a>  And he put the golden altar in the tent of the congregation before the vail:<br><a name="27">27</a>  And he burnt sweet incense thereon; as the LORD commanded Moses.<br><a name="28">28</a>  And he set up the hanging [at] the door of the tabernacle.<br><a name="29">29</a>  And he put the altar of burnt offering [by] the door of the tabernacle of the tent of the congregation, and offered upon it the burnt offering and the meat offering; as the LORD commanded Moses.<br><a name="30">30</a>  And he set the laver between the tent of the congregation and the altar, and put water there, to wash [withal].<br><a name="31">31</a>  And Moses and Aaron and his sons washed their hands and their feet thereat:<br><a name="32">32</a>  When they went into the tent of the congregation, and when they came near unto the altar, they washed; as the LORD commanded Moses.<br><a name="33">33</a>  And he reared up the court round about the tabernacle and the altar, and set up the hanging of the court gate. So Moses finished the work.<br><a name="34">34</a>. Then a cloud covered the tent of the congregation, and the glory of the LORD filled the tabernacle.<br><a name="35">35</a>  And Moses was not able to enter into the tent of the congregation, because the cloud abode thereon, and the glory of the LORD filled the tabernacle.<br><a name="36">36</a>  And when the cloud was taken up from over the tabernacle, the children of Israel went onward in all their journeys:<br><a name="37">37</a>  But if the cloud were not taken up, then they journeyed not till the day that it was taken up.<br><a name="38">38</a>  For the cloud of the LORD [was] upon the tabernacle by day, and fire was on it by night, in the sight of all the house of Israel, throughout all their journeys.<br><br>End of Exodus.<br>Go to <a href="lev1.htm#1">Leviticus 1</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
