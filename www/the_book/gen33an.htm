<dt><b><i>33:1 And Jacob lifted up his eyes, and looked, and, behold,<br>Esau came, and with him four hundred men.<br>And he divided the children unto Leah, and unto Rachel, and unto the two handmaids.<br>
33:2 And he put the handmaids and their children foremost, and Leah and her children after,<br>and Rachel and Joseph hindermost.<br>
33:3 And he passed over before them,<br>and bowed himself to the ground seven times, until he came near to his brother.</i></b></dt><dl>
<dt>Jacob again made preparation according to fleshly wisdom.- <ol type="A">
<li>he divided his family, and set them in order.<br>Those who he cared for least would be exposed to danger first.
<li>he went first.- Perhaps if Esau took vengeance on him, he would spare the others.</ol>
<dd>Jacob has not yet learned to live according to his new name: Israel {'God prevails'}.<br>
If he had been fully trusting God, he would have had no need for these arrangements.<br>In fact, all of his planning (here and in ch.32) proves to be unnecessary.<br>
''We do not fully trust Him, because we do not fully know Him.'' cp. <a href="job22.htm#21">Job 22:21</a>; <a href="joh17.htm#3">Joh 17:3</a> [CHM]

<b><i>33:4 And Esau ran to meet him, and embraced him, and fell on his neck, and kissed him:<br>and they wept.<br>
33:5 And he lifted up his eyes, and saw the women and the children;<br>and said, Who [are] those with thee?<br>And he said, The children which God hath graciously given thy servant.<br>
33:6 Then the handmaidens came near, they and their children, and they bowed themselves.<br>
33:7 And Leah also with her children came near, and bowed themselves:<br>and after came Joseph near and Rachel, and they bowed themselves.<br>
33:8 And he said, What [meanest] thou by all this drove which I met?<br>And he said, [These are] to find grace in the sight of my lord.<br>
33:9 And Esau said, I have enough, my brother; keep that thou hast unto thyself.<br>
33:10 And Jacob said, Nay,<br>I pray thee, if now I have found grace in thy sight, then receive my present at my hand:<br>for therefore I have seen thy face, as though I had seen the face of God,<br>and thou wast pleased with me.<br>
33:11 Take, I pray thee, my blessing that is brought to thee;<br>because God hath dealt graciously with me, and because I have enough. <br>And he urged him, and he took [it].<br>
33:12 And he said, Let us take our journey, and let us go, and I will go before thee.<br>
33:13 And he said unto him, My lord knoweth that the children [are] tender,<br>and the flocks and herds with young [are] with me: <br>and if men should overdrive them one day, all the flock will die.<br>
33:14 Let my lord, I pray thee, pass over before his servant: and I will lead on softly,<br>according as the cattle that goeth before me and the children be able to endure,<br>until I come unto my lord unto Seir.<br>
33:15 And Esau said, Let me now leave with thee [some] of the folk that [are] with me.<br>And he said, What needeth it? let me find grace in the sight of my lord.<br>
33:16 So Esau returned that day on his way unto Seir.</i></b></dt><dl>
<dt>Esau's warm welcome shows that-
<dd>- - God had prepared his heart.
<dd>- - Jacob's fears were groundless, and his schemes were needless. 
<dt>Esau's amazement at the generousity of the gift speaks of the evident change in Jacob.
<dd>Once he used trickery to satisfy his greed.<br>
Now, he knew that God had graciously given him 'enough,' and more than enough. 
<dt>Jacob refused Esau's offer of an armed escort (<a href="gen33.htm#12" target="lwr_lt">v.12,15</a>)
<dd>- - for the reasons which he spoke (<a href="gen33.htm#13" target="lwr_lt">v.13,14</a>),
<dd>- - and perhaps also, due to lingering distrust of Esau.
</dl><dt>
<b><i>33:17 And Jacob journeyed to Succoth, and built him an house, and made booths for his cattle:<br>therefore the name of the place is called Succoth </b></i>{booths, made of branches}<i><b>.<br>
33:18 And Jacob came to Shalem, a city of Shechem, which [is] in the land of Canaan, 
<dd></b></i>{or, 'Jacob came in peace to Shechem, a city which is in the land of Canaan'}<i><b><dt>when he came from Padanaram; and pitched his tent before the city.<br>
33:19 And he bought a parcel of a field, where he had spread his tent,<br>at the hand of the children of Hamor, Shechem's father, for an hundred pieces of money. </b></i>{cp. <a href="josh24.htm#32">Josh 24:32</a>}<i><b><br>
33:20 And he erected there an altar, and called it El-elohe-israel.</i></b></dt><dl>
<dt>Jacob settled in Succoth near Shechem-<ol type="A">
<li>although, he had told Esau that he would follow him to Seir (<a href="gen33.htm#14" target="lwr_lt">v.14</a>).<br>
Apparently, Jacob felt it wise to maintain some distance between Esau and himself.<br>Again, we see evidence of his distrust of Esau, and also of God, who promised to protect him. 
<li>although, 'the God of Bethel' had called him back to the promised land (<a href="gen31.htm#13">31:13</a>).<br>
He had come into Canaan, but he stopped short of Bethel.<br>His choice of dwelling place would soon lead to trouble.</ol>
<dt>El-elohe-israel - ie., 'God, the God of Israel' -<ul>
<li>Jacob exercised faith by appropriating his new name, and by worshipping the One who alone could enable him to apply its meaning to his life.
<li>Yet, his view of God was inadequate, being defined and centered on himself (Israel).<br>But his knowledge of God was growing. Through difficult life experiences, Jacob would soon comprehend Him as El-bethel {the God of the House of God}, defined according to His revelation of Himself and of His  Covenant purposes for His people. cp. <a href="gen35.htm#1">35:1,7</a></ul>
