Psalms  56<br>1. To the chief Musician upon Jonathelemrechokim, Michtam of David, when the Philistines took him in Gath. Be merciful unto me, O God: for man would swallow me up; he fighting daily oppresseth me.<br><a name="2">2</a>  Mine enemies would daily swallow [me] up: for [they be] many that fight against me, O thou most High.<br><a name="3">3</a>  What time I am afraid, I will trust in thee.<br><a name="4">4</a>  In God I will praise his word, in God I have put my trust; I will not fear what flesh can do unto me.<br><a name="5">5</a>  Every day they wrest my words: all their thoughts [are] against me for evil.<br><a name="6">6</a>  They gather themselves together, they hide themselves, they mark my steps, when they wait for my soul.<br><a name="7">7</a>  Shall they escape by iniquity? in [thine] anger cast down the people, O God.<br><a name="8">8</a>. Thou tellest my wanderings: put thou my tears into thy bottle: [are they] not in thy book?<br><a name="9">9</a>  When I cry [unto thee], then shall mine enemies turn back: this I know; for God [is] for me.<br><a name="10">10</a>  In God will I praise [his] word: in the LORD will I praise [his] word.<br><a name="11">11</a>  In God have I put my trust: I will not be afraid what man can do unto me.<br><a name="12">12</a>  Thy vows [are] upon me, O God: I will render praises unto thee.<br><a name="13">13</a>  For thou hast delivered my soul from death: [wilt] not [thou deliver] my feet from falling, that I may walk before God in the light of the living?<br><br>Go to <a href="psa57.htm#1">Psalm 57</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
