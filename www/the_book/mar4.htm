Mark   4<br> 1. And he began again to teach by the sea side: and there was gathered unto him a great multitude, so that he entered into a ship, and sat in the sea; and the whole multitude was by the sea on the land.<br><a name="2">2</a>  And he taught them many things by parables, and said unto them in his doctrine,<br><a name="3">3</a>  Hearken; Behold, there went out a sower to sow:<br><a name="4">4</a>  And it came to pass, as he sowed, some fell by the way side, and the fowls of the air came and devoured it up.<br><a name="5">5</a>  And some fell on stony ground, where it had not much earth; and immediately it sprang up, because it had no depth of earth:<br><a name="6">6</a>  But when the sun was up, it was scorched; and because it had no root, it withered away.<br><a name="7">7</a>  And some fell among thorns, and the thorns grew up, and choked it, and it yielded no fruit.<br><a name="8">8</a>  And other fell on good ground, and did yield fruit that sprang up and increased; and brought forth, some thirty, and some sixty, and some an hundred.<br><a name="9">9</a>  And he said unto them, He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.<br><a name="10">10</a>  And when he was alone, they that were about him with the twelve asked of him the parable.<br><a name="11">11</a>  And he said unto them, Unto you it is given to know the mystery of the kingdom of God: but unto them that are without, all [these] things are done in parables:<br><a name="12">12</a>  That seeing they may see, and not perceive; and hearing they may hear, and not understand; lest at any time they should be converted, and [their] sins should be forgiven them.<br><a name="13">13</a>  And he said unto them, Know ye not this parable? and how then will ye know all parables?<br><a name="14">14</a>  The sower soweth the word.<br><a name="15">15</a>  And these are they by the way side, where the word is sown; but when they have heard, Satan cometh immediately, and taketh away the word that was sown in their hearts.<br><a name="16">16</a>  And these are they likewise which are sown on stony ground; who, when they have heard the word, immediately receive it with gladness;<br><a name="17">17</a>  And have no root in themselves, and so endure but for a time: afterward, when affliction or persecution ariseth for the word's sake, immediately they are offended.<br><a name="18">18</a>  And these are they which are sown among thorns; such as hear the word,<br><a name="19">19</a>  And the cares of this world, and the deceitfulness of riches, and the lusts of other things entering in, choke the word, and it becometh unfruitful.<br><a name="20">20</a>  And these are they which are sown on good ground; such as hear the word, and receive [it], and bring forth fruit, some thirtyfold, some sixty, and some an hundred.<br><a name="21">21</a>. And he said unto them, Is a candle brought to be put under a bushel, or under a bed? and not to be set on a candlestick?<br><a name="22">22</a>  For there is nothing hid, which shall not be manifested; neither was any thing kept secret, but that it should come abroad.<br><a name="23">23</a>  If any man have ears to hear, let him hear.<br><a name="24">24</a>  And he said unto them, Take heed what ye hear: with what measure ye mete, it shall be measured to you: and unto you that hear shall more be given.<br><a name="25">25</a>  For he that hath, to him shall be given: and he that hath not, from him shall be taken even that which he hath.<br><a name="26">26</a>  And he said, So is the kingdom of God, as if a man should cast seed into the ground;<br><a name="27">27</a>  And should sleep, and rise night and day, and the seed should spring and grow up, he knoweth not how.<br><a name="28">28</a>  For the earth bringeth forth fruit of herself; first the blade, then the ear, after that the full corn in the ear.<br><a name="29">29</a>  But when the fruit is brought forth, immediately he putteth in the sickle, because the harvest is come.<br><a name="30">30</a>  And he said, Whereunto shall we liken the kingdom of God? or with what comparison shall we compare it?<br><a name="31">31</a>  [It is] like a grain of mustard seed, which, when it is sown in the earth, is less than all the seeds that be in the earth:<br><a name="32">32</a>  But when it is sown, it groweth up, and becometh greater than all herbs, and shooteth out great branches; so that the fowls of the air may lodge under the shadow of it.<br><a name="33">33</a>  And with many such parables spake he the word unto them, as they were able to hear [it].<br><a name="34">34</a>  But without a parable spake he not unto them: and when they were alone, he expounded all things to his disciples.<br><a name="35">35</a>. And the same day, when the even was come, he saith unto them, Let us pass over unto the other side.<br><a name="36">36</a>  And when they had sent away the multitude, they took him even as he was in the ship. And there were also with him other little ships.<br><a name="37">37</a>  And there arose a great storm of wind, and the waves beat into the ship, so that it was now full.<br><a name="38">38</a>  And he was in the hinder part of the ship, asleep on a pillow: and they awake him, and say unto him, Master, carest thou not that we perish?<br><a name="39">39</a>  And he arose, and rebuked the wind, and said unto the sea, Peace, be still. And the wind ceased, and there was a great calm.<br><a name="40">40</a>  And he said unto them, Why are ye so fearful? how is it that ye have no faith?<br><a name="41">41</a>  And they feared exceedingly, and said one to another, What manner of man is this, that even the wind and the sea obey him?<br><br>Go to <a href="mar5.htm#1">Mark 5</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
