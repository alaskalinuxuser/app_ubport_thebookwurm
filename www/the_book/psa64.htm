Psalms  64<br>1. To the chief Musician, A Psalm of David. Hear my voice, O God, in my prayer: preserve my life from fear of the enemy.<br><a name="2">2</a>  Hide me from the secret counsel of the wicked; from the insurrection of the workers of iniquity:<br><a name="3">3</a>  Who whet their tongue like a sword, [and] bend [their bows to shoot] their arrows, [even] bitter words:<br><a name="4">4</a>  That they may shoot in secret at the perfect: suddenly do they shoot at him, and fear not.<br><a name="5">5</a>  They encourage themselves [in] an evil matter: they commune of laying snares privily; they say, Who shall see them?<br><a name="6">6</a>  They search out iniquities; they accomplish a diligent search: both the inward [thought] of every one [of them], and the heart, [is] deep.<br><a name="7">7</a>. But God shall shoot at them [with] an arrow; suddenly shall they be wounded.<br><a name="8">8</a>  So they shall make their own tongue to fall upon themselves: all that see them shall flee away.<br><a name="9">9</a>  And all men shall fear, and shall declare the work of God; for they shall wisely consider of his doing.<br><a name="10">10</a>  The righteous shall be glad in the LORD, and shall trust in him; and all the upright in heart shall glory.<br><br>Go to <a href="psa65.htm#1">Psalm 65</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
