<p><a name="framesinfo"><b>Frames/No Frames and Mobile Browsers-</b></a> Most Browsers (such as Netscape v. 3.0 or IExplore v. 3.0 or later) are capable of displaying multiple pages on the screen in &quot;HTML Frames.&quot; The default viewing mode for this study series utilizes three windows (frames) which are updated interactively as needed. In this mode, the large upper window contains the lesson, while the two smaller lower windows display cross reference text and other information. A button bar above the large upper window facilitates program navigation.</p>  
<p>If you are viewing in Frame format, this text will be in a window in a lower corner of your browser screen. If the text occupies the full browser window area, you are not in Frame mode or your browser is not Frames compatible. To test your browser, or to return to Frame mode, click here: <a href="go_bible.htm" target="_top">Return to 3 Window Frame Mode</a>. If your browser is not compatible, use the Back button to return to this page.</p>
<p>Some older browsers and many mobile browsers (on smart phones and PDA's) are not fully Frames compatible. Try these alternate viewing modes, to find what works best for your device.<ul>
<li><b>One Page at a Time -</b> You may view this study on non-Frames browsers, one page at a time. Use the <a href="int_menu.htm" target="_blank"><b>Resource Menu</b></a> page as homebase. (That page is titled: &quot;Resources for Understanding the Bible.&quot;) Access program features through the links on that page. Use the &quot;Back&quot; and &quot;Forward&quot; buttons to alternate between desired pages. (After you have opened the <b>Resource Menu</b> page with the above link, close any previously opened browser pages, to prevent possible interaction between the 'Frames' and 'no-Frames' functions.) Some non-frame browsers may open separate windows which correspond to the three frames. If that is the case, you will navigate from window to window (rather than with the back/forward buttons). The page titles may help you navigate.
<li><b>Three Columns Mode -</b> Some mobile phones will allow interactive windows arranged as columns side by side. In this mode, the button bar can be used for navigation. click here to open <a href="gocbible.htm" target="_top">&quot;the Book&quot; - in 3 Columns mode</a>. The &quot;Home&quot; buttons make it easy to switch between the 3 Windows and 3 Columns viewing modes.</ul></p>

<p><a name="bookmarks"><b>Bookmarks-</b></a> Because this site makes heavy use of HTML Frames, bookmarks do not work well in the multi-window viewing modes. You should bookmark the starting page of 'The Book' to facilitate opening the program. However, content on subsequent pages cannot be bookmarked effectively. Once you learn your way around, it is not hard to return to where you left off, by using the Buttons and/or Resource Menu. On the other hand, bookmarks do work well on content, when using the 'One Page at a Time mode.' (See <a href="#framesinfo"><b>Frames Help</b> for more on the various viewing modes.)</a>

<p><a name="print"><b>Printing-</b></a> Most browsers will allow printing of any page presently on-screen. From the top command bar, select &quot;File&quot;, &quot;Print&quot;. If your browser screen is presently divided into multiple windows (Frames), try right clicking on the Frame which you want to print. Then select &quot;Print&quot; from the pop-up menu. With some browsers, this will print the entire article in that frame. With other browsers, it will only print a 'screen shot' of what is presently in view. If that is the case, right click on the frame desired, select 'Properties' to identify the file name and path (ie., the URL to the file). Then enter that data in the URL window of your browser, to call up that individual file. With many browsers, you can adjust the print font size by adjusting the viewed 'text size' and/or by adjusting the page magnification in the 'print preview' mode. </p>

<p><a name="kjv"><b>Thou Sayest??-</b></a> Do you wonder why we chose to use the King James Version (KJV) of the Bible in this publication?  Here are a few reasons:<ol><li>The KJV is public domain. It may be distributed without royalty or copyright concerns.<li>The KJV is a literal translation. It preserves the word order &amp; idioms of the original language. While word pictures from another time &amp; culture may at first confuse the modern reader, once they are understood they  provide a depth of meaning which is often absent from interpretive translations.<li>The KJV old english can be an aid to memory.</ol> Further aids to understanding the language of the KJV Bible are readily available, such as:<ul><li>an English Dictionary,<li>a Dictionary of Bible Words,<li>a modern language translation of the Bible, such as the NKJV-New King James Version, NASV-New American Standard Version, or NIV-New International Version (1984 edition, later NIV editions are less desirable due to attempts to make the text 'gender neutral').</ul>The following aids are part of 'The Book':<ul><li><a href="kjv_thee.htm" target="upper">Help with Thee's &amp; Thou's</a>.<li><a href="kjbco_go.htm" target="_blank">The King James Bible Companion</a>- Definitions of more than 500 archaic words used in the KJV Bible. (Also accessed via the <b>Glossary</b> button on the button bar.)</ul>
