Job  18<br>1. Then answered Bildad the Shuhite, and said,<br><a name="2">2</a>  How long [will it be ere] ye make an end of words? mark, and afterwards we will speak.<br><a name="3">3</a>  Wherefore are we counted as beasts, [and] reputed vile in your sight?<br><a name="4">4</a>  He teareth himself in his anger: shall the earth be forsaken for thee? and shall the rock be removed out of his place?<br><a name="5">5</a>. Yea, the light of the wicked shall be put out, and the spark of his fire shall not shine.<br><a name="6">6</a>  The light shall be dark in his tabernacle, and his candle shall be put out with him.<br><a name="7">7</a>  The steps of his strength shall be straitened, and his own counsel shall cast him down.<br><a name="8">8</a>  For he is cast into a net by his own feet, and he walketh upon a snare.<br><a name="9">9</a>  The gin shall take [him] by the heel, [and] the robber shall prevail against him.<br><a name="10">10</a>  The snare [is] laid for him in the ground, and a trap for him in the way.<br><a name="11">11</a>. Terrors shall make him afraid on every side, and shall drive him to his feet.<br><a name="12">12</a>  His strength shall be hungerbitten, and destruction [shall be] ready at his side.<br><a name="13">13</a>  It shall devour the strength of his skin: [even] the firstborn of death shall devour his strength.<br><a name="14">14</a>  His confidence shall be rooted out of his tabernacle, and it shall bring him to the king of terrors.<br><a name="15">15</a>  It shall dwell in his tabernacle, because [it is] none of his: brimstone shall be scattered upon his habitation.<br><a name="16">16</a>  His roots shall be dried up beneath, and above shall his branch be cut off.<br><a name="17">17</a>  His remembrance shall perish from the earth, and he shall have no name in the street.<br><a name="18">18</a>  He shall be driven from light into darkness, and chased out of the world.<br><a name="19">19</a>  He shall neither have son nor nephew among his people, nor any remaining in his dwellings.<br><a name="20">20</a>  They that come after [him] shall be astonied at his day, as they that went before were affrighted.<br><a name="21">21</a>  Surely such [are] the dwellings of the wicked, and this [is] the place [of him that] knoweth not God.<br><br>Go to <a href="job19.htm#1">Job 19</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
