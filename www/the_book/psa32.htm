Psalms  32<br>1. [A Psalm] of David, Maschil. Blessed [is he whose] transgression [is] forgiven, [whose] sin [is] covered.<br><a name="2">2</a>  Blessed [is] the man unto whom the LORD imputeth not iniquity, and in whose spirit [there is] no guile.<br><a name="3">3</a>  When I kept silence, my bones waxed old through my roaring all the day long.<br><a name="4">4</a>  For day and night thy hand was heavy upon me: my moisture is turned into the drought of summer. Selah.<br><a name="5">5</a>  I acknowledged my sin unto thee, and mine iniquity have I not hid. I said, I will confess my transgressions unto the LORD; and thou forgavest the iniquity of my sin. Selah.<br><a name="6">6</a>  For this shall every one that is godly pray unto thee in a time when thou mayest be found: surely in the floods of great waters they shall not come nigh unto him.<br><a name="7">7</a>. Thou [art] my hiding place; thou shalt preserve me from trouble; thou shalt compass me about with songs of deliverance. Selah.<br><a name="8">8</a>  I will instruct thee and teach thee in the way which thou shalt go: I will guide thee with mine eye.<br><a name="9">9</a>  Be ye not as the horse, [or] as the mule, [which] have no understanding: whose mouth must be held in with bit and bridle, lest they come near unto thee.<br><a name="10">10</a>  Many sorrows [shall be] to the wicked: but he that trusteth in the LORD, mercy shall compass him about.<br><a name="11">11</a>  Be glad in the LORD, and rejoice, ye righteous: and shout for joy, all [ye that are] upright in heart.<br><br>Go to <a href="psa33.htm#1">Psalm 33</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
