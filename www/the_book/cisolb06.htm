<b>Volume 2, Lesson 6</b><br>
by C.I. Scofield
<h2>The Believer Has Been &quot;Made...&quot;</h2></center>
<p>In the last lesson, we saw what Christ was &quot;made&quot; for us. In this lesson, we are to see what we have been &quot;made&quot; in Him. We often see people, proud of being what they call &quot;self-made,&quot; but the believer can never boast of being self-made. Everything that the child of God is, he has been &quot;made&quot; by God, and he has nothing to glory in, &quot;save in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ&quot; (<a href="gal6.htm#14">Galatians 6:14</a>), and must say with Paul, &quot;By the grace of God I am what I am&quot; (<a href="1cor15.htm#10">1Corinthians 15:10</a>).</p>
<b><ol type="A">
<li>The believer has been made righteous</b><br>All our righteousnesses (our best deeds, such as alms-giving, church going, etc.) are &quot;filthy rags&quot; (<a href="isa64.htm#6">Isaiah 64:6</a>), but in Christ every believer is made perfectly, spotlessly righteous. Nothing we can do can make the righteousness of God more perfect.<ul>
<li><a href="rom5.htm#19">Romans 5:19</a> - &quot;Made righteous&quot;
<li><a href="2cor5.htm#21">2Corinthians 5:21</a> - &quot;Made the righteousness of God&quot;</ul><b>
<li>The believer has been made free</b><ul>
<li><a href="gal5.htm#1">Galatians 5:1</a> - &quot;Stand fast... in the liberty.&quot; Free from the Law.
<li><a href="rom6.htm#18">Romans 6:18</a> - &quot;Free from sin.&quot; Free from the power and dominion of our sinful nature.</ul><b>
<li>The believer has been made near to God</b><ul>
<li><a href="eph2.htm#13">Ephesians 2:13</a> - &quot;Made nigh&quot;<blockquote><i>&quot;So near, so very near to God,<br>I can no nearer be;<br>For in the person of His Son<br>I am as near as He.&quot;</i> -- C.Paget</blockquote></ul><b>
<li>The believer has been given acceptance with God</b><ul>
<li><a href="eph1.htm#6">Ephesians 1:6</a> - &quot;He hath made us accepted in the Beloved.&quot; How many uninstructed saints are wondering if they are really accepted of God, when all the while He has <i>made</i> them accepted.</ul><b>
<li>The believer has been given riches</b><ul>
<li><a href="tit3.htm#7">Titus 3:7</a> - &quot;We should be made heirs&quot;
<li><a href="rom8.htm#17">Romans 8:17</a> - &quot;Joint-heirs with Christ&quot;
<li><a href="col1.htm#12">Colossians 1:12</a> - &quot;Made us meet [fit] to be partakers of the inheritance&quot;</ul><b>
<li>The believer has been given a position</b><ul>
<li><a href="eph2.htm#6">Ephesians 2:6</a> - &quot;Made us sit... in heavenly places.&quot; This is not some future blessedness. It is our present position: &quot;<i>Hath</i>... made us sit.&quot;</ul><b>
<li>The believer has been given a rank in the kingdom</b><ul>
<li><a href="rev1.htm#6">Revelation 1:6</a> - &quot;Made us kings and priests.&quot; The poorest and humblest believer on earth is, in God's sight, and before the hosts of heaven, a king and a priest.</ul></ol>
