Proverbs  12<br>1. Whoso loveth instruction loveth knowledge: but he that hateth reproof [is] brutish.<br><a name="2">2</a>. A good [man] obtaineth favour of the LORD: but a man of wicked devices will he condemn.<br><a name="3">3</a>. A man shall not be established by wickedness: but the root of the righteous shall not be moved.<br><a name="4">4</a>. A virtuous woman [is] a crown to her husband: but she that maketh ashamed [is] as rottenness in his bones.<br><a name="5">5</a>. The thoughts of the righteous [are] right: [but] the counsels of the wicked [are] deceit.<br><a name="6">6</a>. The words of the wicked [are] to lie in wait for blood: but the mouth of the upright shall deliver them.<br><a name="7">7</a>. The wicked are overthrown, and [are] not: but the house of the righteous shall stand.<br><a name="8">8</a>. A man shall be commended according to his wisdom: but he that is of a perverse heart shall be despised.<br><a name="9">9</a>. [He that is] despised, and hath a servant, [is] better than he that honoureth himself, and lacketh bread.<br><a name="10">10</a>. A righteous [man] regardeth the life of his beast: but the tender mercies of the wicked [are] cruel.<br><a name="11">11</a>. He that tilleth his land shall be satisfied with bread: but he that followeth vain [persons is] void of understanding.<br><a name="12">12</a>. The wicked desireth the net of evil [men]: but the root of the righteous yieldeth [fruit].<br><a name="13">13</a>. The wicked is snared by the transgression of [his] lips: but the just shall come out of trouble.<br><a name="14">14</a>. A man shall be satisfied with good by the fruit of [his] mouth: and the recompence of a man's hands shall be rendered unto him.<br><a name="15">15</a>. The way of a fool [is] right in his own eyes: but he that hearkeneth unto counsel [is] wise.<br><a name="16">16</a>. A fool's wrath is presently known: but a prudent [man] covereth shame.<br><a name="17">17</a>. [He that] speaketh truth sheweth forth righteousness: but a false witness deceit.<br><a name="18">18</a>. There is that speaketh like the piercings of a sword: but the tongue of the wise [is] health.<br><a name="19">19</a>. The lip of truth shall be established for ever: but a lying tongue [is] but for a moment.<br><a name="20">20</a>. Deceit [is] in the heart of them that imagine evil: but to the counsellors of peace [is] joy.<br><a name="21">21</a>. There shall no evil happen to the just: but the wicked shall be filled with mischief.<br><a name="22">22</a>. Lying lips [are] abomination to the LORD: but they that deal truly [are] his delight.<br><a name="23">23</a>. A prudent man concealeth knowledge: but the heart of fools proclaimeth foolishness.<br><a name="24">24</a>. The hand of the diligent shall bear rule: but the slothful shall be under tribute.<br><a name="25">25</a>. Heaviness in the heart of man maketh it stoop: but a good word maketh it glad.<br><a name="26">26</a>. The righteous [is] more excellent than his neighbour: but the way of the wicked seduceth them.<br><a name="27">27</a>. The slothful [man] roasteth not that which he took in hunting: but the substance of a diligent man [is] precious.<br><a name="28">28</a>. In the way of righteousness [is] life; and [in] the pathway [thereof there is] no death.<br><br>Go to <a href="pro13.htm#1">Proverbs 13</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
