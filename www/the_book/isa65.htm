Isaiah  65<br> 1. I am sought of [them that] asked not [for me]; I am found of [them that] sought me not: I said, Behold me, behold me, unto a nation [that] was not called by my name.<br><a name="2">2</a>  I have spread out my hands all the day unto a rebellious people, which walketh in a way [that was] not good, after their own thoughts;<br><a name="3">3</a>  A people that provoketh me to anger continually to my face; that sacrificeth in gardens, and burneth incense upon altars of brick;<br><a name="4">4</a>  Which remain among the graves, and lodge in the monuments, which eat swine's flesh, and broth of abominable [things is in] their vessels;<br><a name="5">5</a>  Which say, Stand by thyself, come not near to me; for I am holier than thou. These [are] a smoke in my nose, a fire that burneth all the day.<br><a name="6">6</a>  Behold, [it is] written before me: I will not keep silence, but will recompense, even recompense into their bosom,<br><a name="7">7</a>  Your iniquities, and the iniquities of your fathers together, saith the LORD, which have burned incense upon the mountains, and blasphemed me upon the hills: therefore will I measure their former work into their bosom.<br><a name="8">8</a>. Thus saith the LORD, As the new wine is found in the cluster, and [one] saith, Destroy it not; for a blessing [is] in it: so will I do for my servants' sakes, that I may not destroy them all.<br><a name="9">9</a>  And I will bring forth a seed out of Jacob, and out of Judah an inheritor of my mountains: and mine elect shall inherit it, and my servants shall dwell there.<br><a name="10">10</a>  And Sharon shall be a fold of flocks, and the valley of Achor a place for the herds to lie down in, for my people that have sought me.<br><a name="11">11</a>. But ye [are] they that forsake the LORD, that forget my holy mountain, that prepare a table for that troop, and that furnish the drink offering unto that number.<br><a name="12">12</a>  Therefore will I number you to the sword, and ye shall all bow down to the slaughter: because when I called, ye did not answer; when I spake, ye did not hear; but did evil before mine eyes, and did choose [that] wherein I delighted not.<br><a name="13">13</a>  Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD, Behold, my servants shall eat, but ye shall be hungry: behold, my servants shall drink, but ye shall be thirsty: behold, my servants shall rejoice, but ye shall be ashamed:<br><a name="14">14</a>  Behold, my servants shall sing for joy of heart, but ye shall cry for sorrow of heart, and shall howl for vexation of spirit.<br><a name="15">15</a>  And ye shall leave your name for a curse unto my chosen: for the Lord GOD shall slay thee, and call his servants by another name:<br><a name="16">16</a>  That he who blesseth himself in the earth shall bless himself in the God of truth; and he that sweareth in the earth shall swear by the God of truth; because the former troubles are forgotten, and because they are hid from mine eyes.<br><a name="17">17</a>. For, behold, I create new heavens and a new earth: and the former shall not be remembered, nor come into mind.<br><a name="18">18</a>  But be ye glad and rejoice for ever [in that] which I create: for, behold, I create Jerusalem a rejoicing, and her people a joy.<br><a name="19">19</a>  And I will rejoice in Jerusalem, and joy in my people: and the voice of weeping shall be no more heard in her, nor the voice of crying.<br><a name="20">20</a>  There shall be no more thence an infant of days, nor an old man that hath not filled his days: for the child shall die an hundred years old; but the sinner [being] an hundred years old shall be accursed.<br><a name="21">21</a>  And they shall build houses, and inhabit [them]; and they shall plant vineyards, and eat the fruit of them.<br><a name="22">22</a>  They shall not build, and another inhabit; they shall not plant, and another eat: for as the days of a tree [are] the days of my people, and mine elect shall long enjoy the work of their hands.<br><a name="23">23</a>  They shall not labour in vain, nor bring forth for trouble; for they [are] the seed of the blessed of the LORD, and their offspring with them.<br><a name="24">24</a>  And it shall come to pass, that before they call, I will answer; and while they are yet speaking, I will hear.<br><a name="25">25</a>  The wolf and the lamb shall feed together, and the lion shall eat straw like the bullock: and dust [shall be] the serpent's meat. They shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain, saith the LORD.<br><br>Go to <a href="isa66.htm#1">Isaiah 66</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
