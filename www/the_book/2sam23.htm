2Samuel  23<br> 1. Now these [be] the last words of David. David the son of Jesse said, and the man [who was] raised up on high, the anointed of the God of Jacob, and the sweet psalmist of Israel, said,<br><a name="2">2</a>  The Spirit of the LORD spake by me, and his word [was] in my tongue.<br><a name="3">3</a>  The God of Israel said, the Rock of Israel spake to me, He that ruleth over men [must be] just, ruling in the fear of God.<br><a name="4">4</a>  And [he shall be] as the light of the morning, [when] the sun riseth, [even] a morning without clouds; [as] the tender grass [springing] out of the earth by clear shining after rain.<br><a name="5">5</a>  Although my house [be] not so with God; yet he hath made with me an everlasting covenant, ordered in all [things], and sure: for [this is] all my salvation, and all [my] desire, although he make [it] not to grow.<br><a name="6">6</a>  But [the sons] of Belial [shall be] all of them as thorns thrust away, because they cannot be taken with hands:<br><a name="7">7</a>  But the man [that] shall touch them must be fenced with iron and the staff of a spear; and they shall be utterly burned with fire in the [same] place.<br><a name="8">8</a>. These [be] the names of the mighty men whom David had: The Tachmonite that sat in the seat, chief among the captains; the same [was] Adino the Eznite: [he lift up his spear] against eight hundred, whom he slew at one time.<br><a name="9">9</a>  And after him [was] Eleazar the son of Dodo the Ahohite, [one] of the three mighty men with David, when they defied the Philistines [that] were there gathered together to battle, and the men of Israel were gone away:<br><a name="10">10</a>  He arose, and smote the Philistines until his hand was weary, and his hand clave unto the sword: and the LORD wrought a great victory that day; and the people returned after him only to spoil.<br><a name="11">11</a>  And after him [was] Shammah the son of Agee the Hararite. And the Philistines were gathered together into a troop, where was a piece of ground full of lentiles: and the people fled from the Philistines.<br><a name="12">12</a>  But he stood in the midst of the ground, and defended it, and slew the Philistines: and the LORD wrought a great victory.<br><a name="13">13</a>  And three of the thirty chief went down, and came to David in the harvest time unto the cave of Adullam: and the troop of the Philistines pitched in the valley of Rephaim.<br><a name="14">14</a>  And David [was] then in an hold, and the garrison of the Philistines [was] then [in] Bethlehem.<br><a name="15">15</a>  And David longed, and said, Oh that one would give me drink of the water of the well of Bethlehem, which [is] by the gate!<br><a name="16">16</a>  And the three mighty men brake through the host of the Philistines, and drew water out of the well of Bethlehem, that [was] by the gate, and took [it], and brought [it] to David: nevertheless he would not drink thereof, but poured it out unto the LORD.<br><a name="17">17</a>  And he said, Be it far from me, O LORD, that I should do this: [is not this] the blood of the men that went in jeopardy of their lives? therefore he would not drink it. These things did these three mighty men.<br><a name="18">18</a>  And Abishai, the brother of Joab, the son of Zeruiah, was chief among three. And he lifted up his spear against three hundred, [and] slew [them], and had the name among three.<br><a name="19">19</a>  Was he not most honourable of three? therefore he was their captain: howbeit he attained not unto the [first] three.<br><a name="20">20</a>  And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, the son of a valiant man, of Kabzeel, who had done many acts, he slew two lionlike men of Moab: he went down also and slew a lion in the midst of a pit in time of snow:<br><a name="21">21</a>  And he slew an Egyptian, a goodly man: and the Egyptian had a spear in his hand; but he went down to him with a staff, and plucked the spear out of the Egyptian's hand, and slew him with his own spear.<br><a name="22">22</a>  These [things] did Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and had the name among three mighty men.<br><a name="23">23</a>  He was more honourable than the thirty, but he attained not to the [first] three. And David set him over his guard.<br><a name="24">24</a>  Asahel the brother of Joab [was] one of the thirty; Elhanan the son of Dodo of Bethlehem,<br><a name="25">25</a>  Shammah the Harodite, Elika the Harodite,<br><a name="26">26</a>  Helez the Paltite, Ira the son of Ikkesh the Tekoite,<br><a name="27">27</a>  Abiezer the Anethothite, Mebunnai the Hushathite,<br><a name="28">28</a>  Zalmon the Ahohite, Maharai the Netophathite,<br><a name="29">29</a>  Heleb the son of Baanah, a Netophathite, Ittai the son of Ribai out of Gibeah of the children of Benjamin,<br><a name="30">30</a>  Benaiah the Pirathonite, Hiddai of the brooks of Gaash,<br><a name="31">31</a>  Abialbon the Arbathite, Azmaveth the Barhumite,<br><a name="32">32</a>  Eliahba the Shaalbonite, of the sons of Jashen, Jonathan,<br><a name="33">33</a>  Shammah the Hararite, Ahiam the son of Sharar the Hararite,<br><a name="34">34</a>  Eliphelet the son of Ahasbai, the son of the Maachathite, Eliam the son of Ahithophel the Gilonite,<br><a name="35">35</a>  Hezrai the Carmelite, Paarai the Arbite,<br><a name="36">36</a>  Igal the son of Nathan of Zobah, Bani the Gadite,<br><a name="37">37</a>  Zelek the Ammonite, Naharai the Beerothite, armourbearer to Joab the son of Zeruiah,<br><a name="38">38</a>  Ira an Ithrite, Gareb an Ithrite,<br><a name="39">39</a>  Uriah the Hittite: thirty and seven in all.<br><br>Go to <a href="2sam24.htm#1">II Samuel 24</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
