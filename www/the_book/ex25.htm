Exodus  25<br>1. And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,<br><a name="2">2</a>  Speak unto the children of Israel, that they bring me an offering: of every man that giveth it willingly with his heart ye shall take my offering.<br><a name="3">3</a>  And this [is] the offering which ye shall take of them; gold, and silver, and brass,<br><a name="4">4</a>  And blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine linen, and goats' [hair],<br><a name="5">5</a>  And rams' skins dyed red, and badgers' skins, and shittim wood,<br><a name="6">6</a>  Oil for the light, spices for anointing oil, and for sweet incense,<br><a name="7">7</a>  Onyx stones, and stones to be set in the ephod, and in the breastplate.<br><a name="8">8</a>  And let them make me a sanctuary; that I may dwell among them.<br><a name="9">9</a>  According to all that I shew thee, [after] the pattern of the tabernacle, and the pattern of all the instruments thereof, even so shall ye make [it].<br><a name="10">10</a>. And they shall make an ark [of] shittim wood: two cubits and a half [shall be] the length thereof, and a cubit and a half the breadth thereof, and a cubit and a half the height thereof.<br><a name="11">11</a>  And thou shalt overlay it with pure gold, within and without shalt thou overlay it, and shalt make upon it a crown of gold round about.<br><a name="12">12</a>  And thou shalt cast four rings of gold for it, and put [them] in the four corners thereof; and two rings [shall be] in the one side of it, and two rings in the other side of it.<br><a name="13">13</a>  And thou shalt make staves [of] shittim wood, and overlay them with gold.<br><a name="14">14</a>  And thou shalt put the staves into the rings by the sides of the ark, that the ark may be borne with them.<br><a name="15">15</a>  The staves shall be in the rings of the ark: they shall not be taken from it.<br><a name="16">16</a>  And thou shalt put into the ark the testimony which I shall give thee.<br><a name="17">17</a>  And thou shalt make a mercy seat [of] pure gold: two cubits and a half [shall be] the length thereof, and a cubit and a half the breadth thereof.<br><a name="18">18</a>  And thou shalt make two cherubims [of] gold, [of] beaten work shalt thou make them, in the two ends of the mercy seat.<br><a name="19">19</a>  And make one cherub on the one end, and the other cherub on the other end: [even] of the mercy seat shall ye make the cherubims on the two ends thereof.<br><a name="20">20</a>  And the cherubims shall stretch forth [their] wings on high, covering the mercy seat with their wings, and their faces [shall look] one to another; toward the mercy seat shall the faces of the cherubims be.<br><a name="21">21</a>  And thou shalt put the mercy seat above upon the ark; and in the ark thou shalt put the testimony that I shall give thee.<br><a name="22">22</a>  And there I will meet with thee, and I will commune with thee from above the mercy seat, from between the two cherubims which [are] upon the ark of the testimony, of all [things] which I will give thee in commandment unto the children of Israel.<br><a name="23">23</a>. Thou shalt also make a table [of] shittim wood: two cubits [shall be] the length thereof, and a cubit the breadth thereof, and a cubit and a half the height thereof.<br><a name="24">24</a>  And thou shalt overlay it with pure gold, and make thereto a crown of gold round about.<br><a name="25">25</a>  And thou shalt make unto it a border of an hand breadth round about, and thou shalt make a golden crown to the border thereof round about.<br><a name="26">26</a>  And thou shalt make for it four rings of gold, and put the rings in the four corners that [are] on the four feet thereof.<br><a name="27">27</a>  Over against the border shall the rings be for places of the staves to bear the table.<br><a name="28">28</a>  And thou shalt make the staves [of] shittim wood, and overlay them with gold, that the table may be borne with them.<br><a name="29">29</a>  And thou shalt make the dishes thereof, and spoons thereof, and covers thereof, and bowls thereof, to cover withal: [of] pure gold shalt thou make them.<br><a name="30">30</a>  And thou shalt set upon the table shewbread before me alway.<br><a name="31">31</a>. And thou shalt make a candlestick [of] pure gold: [of] beaten work shall the candlestick be made: his shaft, and his branches, his bowls, his knops, and his flowers, shall be of the same.<br><a name="32">32</a>  And six branches shall come out of the sides of it; three branches of the candlestick out of the one side, and three branches of the candlestick out of the other side:<br><a name="33">33</a>  Three bowls made like unto almonds, [with] a knop and a flower in one branch; and three bowls made like almonds in the other branch, [with] a knop and a flower: so in the six branches that come out of the candlestick.<br><a name="34">34</a>  And in the candlestick [shall be] four bowls made like unto almonds, [with] their knops and their flowers.<br><a name="35">35</a>  And [there shall be] a knop under two branches of the same, and a knop under two branches of the same, and a knop under two branches of the same, according to the six branches that proceed out of the candlestick.<br><a name="36">36</a>  Their knops and their branches shall be of the same: all it [shall be] one beaten work [of] pure gold.<br><a name="37">37</a>  And thou shalt make the seven lamps thereof: and they shall light the lamps thereof, that they may give light over against it.<br><a name="38">38</a>  And the tongs thereof, and the snuffdishes thereof, [shall be of] pure gold.<br><a name="39">39</a>  [Of] a talent of pure gold shall he make it, with all these vessels.<br><a name="40">40</a>  And look that thou make [them] after their pattern, which was shewed thee in the mount.<br><br>Go to <a href="ex26.htm#1">Exodus 26</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
