Psalms 107<br> 1. O give thanks unto the LORD, for [he is] good: for his mercy [endureth] for ever.<br><a name="2">2</a>  Let the redeemed of the LORD say [so], whom he hath redeemed from the hand of the enemy;<br><a name="3">3</a>  And gathered them out of the lands, from the east, and from the west, from the north, and from the south.<br><a name="4">4</a>  They wandered in the wilderness in a solitary way; they found no city to dwell in.<br><a name="5">5</a>  Hungry and thirsty, their soul fainted in them.<br><a name="6">6</a>  Then they cried unto the LORD in their trouble, [and] he delivered them out of their distresses.<br><a name="7">7</a>  And he led them forth by the right way, that they might go to a city of habitation.<br><a name="8">8</a>  Oh that [men] would praise the LORD [for] his goodness, and [for] his wonderful works to the children of men!<br><a name="9">9</a>  For he satisfieth the longing soul, and filleth the hungry soul with goodness.<br><a name="10">10</a>. Such as sit in darkness and in the shadow of death, [being] bound in affliction and iron;<br><a name="11">11</a>  Because they rebelled against the words of God, and contemned the counsel of the most High:<br><a name="12">12</a>  Therefore he brought down their heart with labour; they fell down, and [there was] none to help.<br><a name="13">13</a>  Then they cried unto the LORD in their trouble, [and] he saved them out of their distresses.<br><a name="14">14</a>  He brought them out of darkness and the shadow of death, and brake their bands in sunder.<br><a name="15">15</a>  Oh that [men] would praise the LORD [for] his goodness, and [for] his wonderful works to the children of men!<br><a name="16">16</a>  For he hath broken the gates of brass, and cut the bars of iron in sunder.<br><a name="17">17</a>. Fools because of their transgression, and because of their iniquities, are afflicted.<br><a name="18">18</a>  Their soul abhorreth all manner of meat; and they draw near unto the gates of death.<br><a name="19">19</a>  Then they cry unto the LORD in their trouble, [and] he saveth them out of their distresses.<br><a name="20">20</a>  He sent his word, and healed them, and delivered [them] from their destructions.<br><a name="21">21</a>  Oh that [men] would praise the LORD [for] his goodness, and [for] his wonderful works to the children of men!<br><a name="22">22</a>  And let them sacrifice the sacrifices of thanksgiving, and declare his works with rejoicing.<br><a name="23">23</a>. They that go down to the sea in ships, that do business in great waters;<br><a name="24">24</a>  These see the works of the LORD, and his wonders in the deep.<br><a name="25">25</a>  For he commandeth, and raiseth the stormy wind, which lifteth up the waves thereof.<br><a name="26">26</a>  They mount up to the heaven, they go down again to the depths: their soul is melted because of trouble.<br><a name="27">27</a>  They reel to and fro, and stagger like a drunken man, and are at their wits' end.<br><a name="28">28</a>  Then they cry unto the LORD in their trouble, and he bringeth them out of their distresses.<br><a name="29">29</a>  He maketh the storm a calm, so that the waves thereof are still.<br><a name="30">30</a>  Then are they glad because they be quiet; so he bringeth them unto their desired haven.<br><a name="31">31</a>  Oh that [men] would praise the LORD [for] his goodness, and [for] his wonderful works to the children of men!<br><a name="32">32</a>  Let them exalt him also in the congregation of the people, and praise him in the assembly of the elders.<br><a name="33">33</a>. He turneth rivers into a wilderness, and the watersprings into dry ground;<br><a name="34">34</a>  A fruitful land into barrenness, for the wickedness of them that dwell therein.<br><a name="35">35</a>  He turneth the wilderness into a standing water, and dry ground into watersprings.<br><a name="36">36</a>  And there he maketh the hungry to dwell, that they may prepare a city for habitation;<br><a name="37">37</a>  And sow the fields, and plant vineyards, which may yield fruits of increase.<br><a name="38">38</a>  He blesseth them also, so that they are multiplied greatly; and suffereth not their cattle to decrease.<br><a name="39">39</a>  Again, they are minished and brought low through oppression, affliction, and sorrow.<br><a name="40">40</a>  He poureth contempt upon princes, and causeth them to wander in the wilderness, [where there is] no way.<br><a name="41">41</a>  Yet setteth he the poor on high from affliction, and maketh [him] families like a flock.<br><a name="42">42</a>  The righteous shall see [it], and rejoice: and all iniquity shall stop her mouth.<br><a name="43">43</a>  Whoso [is] wise, and will observe these [things], even they shall understand the lovingkindness of the LORD.<br><br>Go to <a href="psa108.htm#1">Psalm 108</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
