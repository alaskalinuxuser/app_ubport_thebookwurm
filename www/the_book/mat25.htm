Matthew  25<br> 1. Then shall the kingdom of heaven be likened unto ten virgins, which took their lamps, and went forth to meet the bridegroom.<br><a name="2">2</a>  And five of them were wise, and five [were] foolish.<br><a name="3">3</a>  They that [were] foolish took their lamps, and took no oil with them:<br><a name="4">4</a>  But the wise took oil in their vessels with their lamps.<br><a name="5">5</a>  While the bridegroom tarried, they all slumbered and slept.<br><a name="6">6</a>  And at midnight there was a cry made, Behold, the bridegroom cometh; go ye out to meet him.<br><a name="7">7</a>  Then all those virgins arose, and trimmed their lamps.<br><a name="8">8</a>  And the foolish said unto the wise, Give us of your oil; for our lamps are gone out.<br><a name="9">9</a>  But the wise answered, saying, [Not so]; lest there be not enough for us and you: but go ye rather to them that sell, and buy for yourselves.<br><a name="10">10</a>  And while they went to buy, the bridegroom came; and they that were ready went in with him to the marriage: and the door was shut.<br><a name="11">11</a>  Afterward came also the other virgins, saying, Lord, Lord, open to us.<br><a name="12">12</a>  But he answered and said, Verily I say unto you, I know you not.<br><a name="13">13</a>  Watch therefore, for ye know neither the day nor the hour wherein the Son of man cometh.<br><a name="14">14</a>. For [the kingdom of heaven is] as a man travelling into a far country, [who] called his own servants, and delivered unto them his goods.<br><a name="15">15</a>  And unto one he gave five talents, to another two, and to another one; to every man according to his several ability; and straightway took his journey.<br><a name="16">16</a>  Then he that had received the five talents went and traded with the same, and made [them] other five talents.<br><a name="17">17</a>  And likewise he that [had received] two, he also gained other two.<br><a name="18">18</a>  But he that had received one went and digged in the earth, and hid his lord's money.<br><a name="19">19</a>  After a long time the lord of those servants cometh, and reckoneth with them.<br><a name="20">20</a>  And so he that had received five talents came and brought other five talents, saying, Lord, thou deliveredst unto me five talents: behold, I have gained beside them five talents more.<br><a name="21">21</a>  His lord said unto him, Well done, [thou] good and faithful servant: thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will make thee ruler over many things: enter thou into the joy of thy lord.<br><a name="22">22</a>  He also that had received two talents came and said, Lord, thou deliveredst unto me two talents: behold, I have gained two other talents beside them.<br><a name="23">23</a>  His lord said unto him, Well done, good and faithful servant; thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will make thee ruler over many things: enter thou into the joy of thy lord.<br><a name="24">24</a>  Then he which had received the one talent came and said, Lord, I knew thee that thou art an hard man, reaping where thou hast not sown, and gathering where thou hast not strawed:<br><a name="25">25</a>  And I was afraid, and went and hid thy talent in the earth: lo, [there] thou hast [that is] thine.<br><a name="26">26</a>  His lord answered and said unto him, [Thou] wicked and slothful servant, thou knewest that I reap where I sowed not, and gather where I have not strawed:<br><a name="27">27</a>  Thou oughtest therefore to have put my money to the exchangers, and [then] at my coming I should have received mine own with usury.<br><a name="28">28</a>  Take therefore the talent from him, and give [it] unto him which hath ten talents.<br><a name="29">29</a>  For unto every one that hath shall be given, and he shall have abundance: but from him that hath not shall be taken away even that which he hath.<br><a name="30">30</a>  And cast ye the unprofitable servant into outer darkness: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.<br><a name="31">31</a>. When the Son of man shall come in his glory, and all the holy angels with him, then shall he sit upon the throne of his glory:<br><a name="32">32</a>  And before him shall be gathered all nations: and he shall separate them one from another, as a shepherd divideth [his] sheep from the goats:<br><a name="33">33</a>  And he shall set the sheep on his right hand, but the goats on the left.<br><a name="34">34</a>  Then shall the King say unto them on his right hand, Come, ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world:<br><a name="35">35</a>  For I was an hungred, and ye gave me meat: I was thirsty, and ye gave me drink: I was a stranger, and ye took me in:<br><a name="36">36</a>  Naked, and ye clothed me: I was sick, and ye visited me: I was in prison, and ye came unto me.<br><a name="37">37</a>  Then shall the righteous answer him, saying, Lord, when saw we thee an hungred, and fed [thee]? or thirsty, and gave [thee] drink?<br><a name="38">38</a>  When saw we thee a stranger, and took [thee] in? or naked, and clothed [thee]?<br><a name="39">39</a>  Or when saw we thee sick, or in prison, and came unto thee?<br><a name="40">40</a>  And the King shall answer and say unto them, Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye have done [it] unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done [it] unto me.<br><a name="41">41</a>  Then shall he say also unto them on the left hand, Depart from me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels:<br><a name="42">42</a>  For I was an hungred, and ye gave me no meat: I was thirsty, and ye gave me no drink:<br><a name="43">43</a>  I was a stranger, and ye took me not in: naked, and ye clothed me not: sick, and in prison, and ye visited me not.<br><a name="44">44</a>  Then shall they also answer him, saying, Lord, when saw we thee an hungred, or athirst, or a stranger, or naked, or sick, or in prison, and did not minister unto thee?<br><a name="45">45</a>  Then shall he answer them, saying, Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye did [it] not to one of the least of these, ye did [it] not to me.<br><a name="46">46</a>  And these shall go away into everlasting punishment: but the righteous into life eternal.<br><br>Go to <a href="mat26.htm#1">Matthew 26</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
