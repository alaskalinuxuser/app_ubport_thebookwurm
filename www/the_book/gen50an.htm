<dt><b><i>50:1 And Joseph fell upon his father's face, and wept upon him, and kissed him. </b></i>{cp. <a href="gen46.htm#4">46:4,29</a>}<i><b><br>
50:2 And Joseph commanded his servants the physicians to embalm his father:<br>and the physicians embalmed Israel.<br>
50:3 And forty days were fulfilled for him; for so are fulfilled the days of those which are embalmed:<br>and the Egyptians mourned for him threescore and ten days.<br>
50:4 And when the days of his mourning were past, Joseph spake unto the house of Pharaoh, saying,<br>If now I have found grace in your eyes, speak, I pray you, in the ears of Pharaoh, saying,<br>
50:5 My father made me swear, saying, Lo, I die:<br>in my grave which I have digged for me in the land of Canaan, there shalt thou bury me.<br>Now therefore let me go up, I pray thee, and bury my father, and I will come again.<br>
50:6 And Pharaoh said, Go up, and bury thy father, according as he made thee swear.<br>
50:7 And Joseph went up to bury his father: and with him went up all the servants of Pharaoh,<br>the elders of his house, and all the elders of the land of Egypt,<br>
50:8 And all the house of Joseph, and his brethren, and his father's house:<br>only their little ones, and their flocks, and their herds, they left in the land of Goshen.<br>
50:9 And there went up with him both chariots and horsemen: and it was a very great company.<br>
50:10 And they came to the threshingfloor of Atad, which [is] beyond Jordan,<br>and there they mourned with a great and very sore lamentation:<br>and he made a mourning for his father seven days.<br>
50:11 And when the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites, saw the mourning in the floor of Atad,<br>they said, This [is] a grievous mourning to the Egyptians:<br>
wherefore the name of it was called Abelmizraim </b></i>{lit., 'mourning of the Egyptians'}<i><b><br>which [is] beyond Jordan.<br>
50:12 And his sons did unto him according as he commanded them:<br>
50:13 For his sons carried him into the land of Canaan,<br>and buried him in the cave of the field of Machpelah, which Abraham bought with the field<br>for a possession of a buryingplace of Ephron the Hittite, before Mamre.<br>
50:14 And Joseph returned into Egypt, he, and his brethren,<br>and all that went up with him to bury his father, after he had buried his father.</i></b></dt><dl>
<dt>This is a grievous mourning to the Egyptians-
<dd>If Joseph was 'a father unto Pharaoh' (<a href="gen45.htm#8">45:8</a>), the Egyptians must have revered his father. The God of Joseph's fathers had preserved their nation from total ruin.
The aged pilgrim who stumbled in his fleshly walk, had become a blessing in his walk by faith. 
It was as God had said: 'I will bless thee... and thou shalt be a blessing...' (<a href="gen12.htm#2">Gen 12:2</a>).
</dl><dt>
<b><i>50:15 And when Joseph's brethren saw that their father was dead, they said,<br>Joseph will peradventure hate us, and will certainly requite us all the evil which we did unto him.<br>
50:16 And they sent a messenger unto Joseph, saying,<br>Thy father did command before he died, saying,<br>
50:17 So shall ye say unto Joseph,<br>Forgive, I pray thee now, the trespass of thy brethren, and their sin; for they did unto thee evil:<br>and now, we pray thee, forgive the trespass of the servants of the God of thy father.<br>And Joseph wept when they spake unto him.<br>
50:18 And his brethren also went and fell down before his face; and they said,<br>Behold, we [be] thy servants. </b></i>{cp. <a href="gen37.htm#8">37:8,10</a>}<i><b><br>
50:19 And Joseph said unto them, Fear not: for [am] I in the place of God?<br>
50:20 But as for you, ye thought evil against me;<br>[but] God meant it unto good, to bring to pass, as [it is] this day, to save much people alive.<br>
50:21 Now therefore fear ye not: I will nourish you, and your little ones.<br>And he comforted them, and spake kindly unto them.</i></b> {lit., he spoke to their hearts.}</dt><dl>
<dt>Joseph wept when they spake unto him- 
<dd>It broke his heart that they were afraid of him, because they did not know his heart,<br>and they had not believed his words, nor fully trusted in the grace of God. cp. <a href="gen45.htm#4">45:4-8</a>
</dl><dt>
<b><i>50:22 And Joseph dwelt in Egypt, he, and his father's house:<br>and Joseph lived an hundred and ten years.<br>
50:23 And Joseph saw Ephraim's children of the third [generation]:<br>the children also of Machir the son of Manasseh were brought up upon Joseph's knees.<br>
50:24 And Joseph said unto his brethren, I die: and God will surely visit you,<br>and bring you out of this land unto the land which he sware to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob.<br>
50:25 And Joseph took an oath of the children of Israel, saying,<br>God will surely visit you, and ye shall carry up my bones from hence. </b></i>{<a href="gen15.htm#13">15:13-16</a>}<i><b><br>
50:26 So Joseph died, [being] an hundred and ten years old:<br>and they embalmed him, and he was put in a coffin in Egypt.</i></b> {cp. <a href="ex13.htm#19">Ex 13:19</a>; <a href="josh24.htm#32">Josh 24:32</a>}</dt><dl>
<dt>Manasseh had only one son, Machir. The tribe of Manesseh is sometimes called Machir. 
<dt>Joseph's command concerning his bones was a statement of his faith that
<dd>God would fulfill His Word concerning His covenant promises,<br>
and that he himself would be resurrected to enjoy that future day. cp. <a href="heb11.htm#22">Heb 11:22</a>
<dt>...in a coffin in Egypt. - 
<dd>The book of beginnings (Genesis), opens with the gift of life, and closes with the consequences of man's fall (<a href="rom5.htm#12">Rom 5:12</a>).<dd>To unbelievers, these closing words mark the end, and echo with despair at death's finality.  
<dd>Yet, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and Joseph all rest in faith, awaiting the Salvation, promised by their God. cp. <a href="gen49.htm#18">Gen 49:18</a>; <a href="heb11.htm#13">Heb 11:13</a>
