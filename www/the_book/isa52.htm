Isaiah  52<br> 1. Awake, awake; put on thy strength, O Zion; put on thy beautiful garments, O Jerusalem, the holy city: for henceforth there shall no more come into thee the uncircumcised and the unclean.<br><a name="2">2</a>  Shake thyself from the dust; arise, [and] sit down, O Jerusalem: loose thyself from the bands of thy neck, O captive daughter of Zion.<br><a name="3">3</a>  For thus saith the LORD, Ye have sold yourselves for nought; and ye shall be redeemed without money.<br><a name="4">4</a>  For thus saith the Lord GOD, My people went down aforetime into Egypt to sojourn there; and the Assyrian oppressed them without cause.<br><a name="5">5</a>  Now therefore, what have I here, saith the LORD, that my people is taken away for nought? they that rule over them make them to howl, saith the LORD; and my name continually every day [is] blasphemed.<br><a name="6">6</a>  Therefore my people shall know my name: therefore [they shall know] in that day that I [am] he that doth speak: behold, [it is] I.<br><a name="7">7</a>. How beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of him that bringeth good tidings, that publisheth peace; that bringeth good tidings of good, that publisheth salvation; that saith unto Zion, Thy God reigneth!<br><a name="8">8</a>  Thy watchmen shall lift up the voice; with the voice together shall they sing: for they shall see eye to eye, when the LORD shall bring again Zion.<br><a name="9">9</a>  Break forth into joy, sing together, ye waste places of Jerusalem: for the LORD hath comforted his people, he hath redeemed Jerusalem.<br><a name="10">10</a>  The LORD hath made bare his holy arm in the eyes of all the nations; and all the ends of the earth shall see the salvation of our God.<br><a name="11">11</a>  Depart ye, depart ye, go ye out from thence, touch no unclean [thing]; go ye out of the midst of her; be ye clean, that bear the vessels of the LORD.<br><a name="12">12</a>  For ye shall not go out with haste, nor go by flight: for the LORD will go before you; and the God of Israel [will be] your rereward.<br><a name="13">13</a>. Behold, my servant shall deal prudently, he shall be exalted and extolled, and be very high.<br><a name="14">14</a>  As many were astonied at thee; his visage was so marred more than any man, and his form more than the sons of men:<br><a name="15">15</a>  So shall he sprinkle many nations; the kings shall shut their mouths at him: for [that] which had not been told them shall they see; and [that] which they had not heard shall they consider.<br><br>Go to <a href="isa53.htm#1">Isaiah 53</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
