<b>Volume 3, Lesson 4</b><br>
by C.I. Scofield
<h2>Israel and the Church</h2></center>
<p>The Scriptures separate the human family into three grand divisions -- the Jew, the Gentile and the Church. Each has a distinct place in the counsels and purposes of God (<a href="1cor10.htm#32">1Corinthians 10:32</a>). To apply the promises, prophecies, and responsibilities of one of these groups to another, is to wholly lose sight of the divine order and beauty of the plan of God, and to hopelessly confuse the interpretation of His Word. The comparative position of Israel and the Church may be seen in the Scriptures, as well as the striking contrast between each in respect to promise, calling, conduct, worship, and future.</p>

<li><a href="rev20.htm#6">Revelation 20:6</a> - &quot;Shall be priests... reign with Him&quot;</ul></ol>
<p>In the above verses, we see the contrast. Israel was called to an earthly inheritance, and the Church to a heavenly. Israel's faithfulness and obedience were to be rewarded with earthly greatness, riches and power, while the Church, if faithful, is promised heavenly riches, but, on earth, persecution, poverty, and hatred. Israel could worship in but one place, and at a distance from God -- only approaching Him through a priest; the Church worships wherever two or three are gathered, has boldness to enter into the holiest, and is composed of priests. In the future, the Church will be taken away from the earth entirely, but restored Israel is yet to have her greatest earthly splendor and power.</p></ol>
