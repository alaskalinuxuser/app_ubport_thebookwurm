<b>Volume 2, Lesson 9</b><br>
by C.I. Scofield
<h2>Abiding</h2></center>
<p>Read <a href="joh15.htm#1">John 15:1-16</a>. The word &quot;abide&quot; as used in John 15 means to continue, to dwell, or to remain. If we think of salvation as coming to the King for pardon, abiding would mean remaining with the King for blessing: sitting, like Mary, at His feet to hear His word (<a href="luk10.htm#39">Luke 10:39</a>); looking up into His face to behold His beauty (<a href="psa27.htm#4">Psalm 27:4</a>); or walking with Him (for that is what His &quot;yoke&quot; means) in happy, restful service (<a href="mat11.htm#29">Matthew 11:29</a>). It is asking Him for everything, and thanking Him for everything (<a href="php4.htm#6">Philippians 4:6</a>). Abiding is not a condition of salvation, but of blessing.</p>
<p>There are seven results of abiding:</p>
<b><ol type="A">
<li>Bearing fruit</b><ul>
<li><a href="joh15.htm#1">John 15:1-8</a> - &quot;He that abideth in Me... bringeth forth much fruit&quot;<br>Three degrees of fruitfulness are mentioned: &quot;fruit,&quot; &quot;more fruit&quot; (v.2), and &quot;much fruit&quot; (v.5). Not until <i>much</i> fruit is produced is the Father glorified, or our discipleship proved (v.8).</ul><b>
<li>Answered prayer</b><ul>
<li><a href="joh15.htm#7">John 15:7</a> - &quot;Ye shall ask what ye will, and it shall be done unto you&quot;<br>If we are &quot;abiding&quot; we will not ask anything contrary to His character. This explains <a href="joh14.htm#13">John 14:13,14</a> where &quot;name&quot; stands for His character.</ul><b>
<li>Realizing His love</b><ul>
<li><a href="joh15.htm#9">John 15:9</a> - &quot;Continue ye in My love&quot;<br>If we abide in Him, we will always have the realization or the sense of His love. When we get away from Christ, we lose this.</ul><b>
<li>Obedience</b><ul>
<li><a href="joh15.htm#10">John 15:10</a> - &quot;Keep My commandments&quot;<br>It is very hard to keep Christ's commandments (see <a href="joh15.htm#17">John 15:17</a>; <a href="1joh3.htm#23">1John 3:23</a>) if we are not &quot;abiding.&quot; But if we keep close to Him, it is impossible <i>not</i> to keep the law of love.</ul><b>
<li>Fullness of joy</b><ul>
<li><a href="joh15.htm#11">John 15:11</a> - &quot;Your joy might be full&quot;<br>The Christian ought to be happy. It is a duty as well as a privilege, for nothing so recommends our Lord to the unsaved as a holy joy. This, too, is found only in abiding (see <a href="psa16.htm#11">Psalm 16:11</a>).</ul><b>
<li>The knowledge of His will</b><ul>
<li><a href="joh15.htm#15">John 15:15</a> - &quot;All things that I have heard of My Father I have made known unto you&quot;<br>So many believers complain that they do not know the will of the Lord about this or that. That is because they are not &quot;abiding.&quot; It is His delight to tell His purposes to His &quot;friends&quot; (see <a href="gen18.htm#17">Genesis 18:17,18</a>).</ul><b>
<li>Permanent results</b><ul>
<li><a href="joh15.htm#16">John 15:16</a> - &quot;Your fruit should remain&quot;<br>There is a great deal of fruit that looks promising while green, but never comes to maturity (see <a href="luk8.htm#14">Luke 8:14</a>). But when the branch abides, the rich sap of His life flows unhindered, and the fruit becomes sound and perfect.</ul></ol>
