These words spake Jesus, and lifted up his eyes to heaven, and said, Father, the hour is come; glorify thy Son, that thy Son also may glorify thee:<br><a name="2">2</a>  As thou hast given him power over all flesh, that he should give eternal life to as many as thou hast given him.<br><a name="3">3</a>  And this is life eternal, that they might know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent.<br><a name="4">4</a>  I have glorified thee on the earth: I have finished the work which thou gavest me to do.<br><a name="5">5</a>  And now, O Father, glorify thou me with thine own self with the glory which I had with thee before the world was.<br><a name="6">6</a>. I have manifested thy name unto the men which thou gavest me out of the world: thine they were, and thou gavest them me; and they have kept thy word.<br><a name="7">7</a>  Now they have known that all things whatsoever thou hast given me are of thee.<br><a name="8">8</a>  For I have given unto them the words which thou gavest me; and they have received [them], and have known surely that I came out from thee, and they have believed that thou didst send me.<br><a name="9">9</a>  I pray for them: I pray not for the world, but for them which thou hast given me; for they are thine.<br><a name="10">10</a>  And all mine are thine, and thine are mine; and I am glorified in them.<br><a name="11">11</a>. And now I am no more in the world, but these are in the world, and I come to thee. Holy Father, keep through thine own name those whom thou hast given me, that they may be one, as we [are].<br><a name="12">12</a>  While I was with them in the world, I kept them in thy name: those that thou gavest me I have kept, and none of them is lost, but the son of perdition; that the scripture might be fulfilled.<br><a name="13">13</a>  And now come I to thee; and these things I speak in the world, that they might have my joy fulfilled in themselves.<br><a name="14">14</a>  I have given them thy word; and the world hath hated them, because they are not of the world, even as I am not of the world.<br><a name="15">15</a>  I pray not that thou shouldest take them out of the world, but that thou shouldest keep them from the evil.<br><a name="16">16</a>  They are not of the world, even as I am not of the world.<br><a name="17">17</a>. Sanctify them through thy truth: thy word is truth.<br><a name="18">18</a>  As thou hast sent me into the world, even so have I also sent them into the world.<br><a name="19">19</a>  And for their sakes I sanctify myself, that they also might be sanctified through the truth.<br><a name="20">20</a>. Neither pray I for these alone, but for them also which shall believe on me through their word;<br><a name="21">21</a>  That they all may be one; as thou, Father, [art] in me, and I in thee, that they also may be one in us: that the world may believe that thou hast sent me.<br><a name="22">22</a>  And the glory which thou gavest me I have given them; that they may be one, even as we are one:<br><a name="23">23</a>  I in them, and thou in me, that they may be made perfect in one; and that the world may know that thou hast sent me, and hast loved them, as thou hast loved me.<br><a name="24">24</a>. Father, I will that they also, whom thou hast given me, be with me where I am; that they may behold my glory, which thou hast given me: for thou lovedst me before the foundation of the world.<br><a name="25"></a> 25  O righteous Father, the world hath not known thee: but I have known thee, and these have known that thou hast sent me.<br><a name="26">26</a>  And I have declared unto them thy name, and will declare [it]: that the love wherewith thou hast loved me may be in them, and I in them.<br><br>Go to <a href="joh18.htm#1">John 18</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
