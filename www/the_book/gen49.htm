Genesis  49<br> 1. And Jacob called unto his sons, and said, Gather yourselves together, that I may tell you [that] which shall befall you in the last days.<br><a name="2">2</a>  Gather yourselves together, and hear, ye sons of Jacob; and hearken unto Israel your father.<br><a name="3">3</a>  Reuben, thou [art] my firstborn, my might, and the beginning of my strength, the excellency of dignity, and the excellency of power:<br><a name="4">4</a>  Unstable as water, thou shalt not excel; because thou wentest up to thy father's bed; then defiledst thou [it]: he went up to my couch.<br><a name="5">5</a>. Simeon and Levi [are] brethren; instruments of cruelty [are in] their habitations.<br><a name="6">6</a>  O my soul, come not thou into their secret; unto their assembly, mine honour, be not thou united: for in their anger they slew a man, and in their selfwill they digged down a wall.<br><a name="7">7</a>  Cursed [be] their anger, for [it was] fierce; and their wrath, for it was cruel: I will divide them in Jacob, and scatter them in Israel.<br><a name="8">8</a>. Judah, thou [art he] whom thy brethren shall praise: thy hand [shall be] in the neck of thine enemies; thy father's children shall bow down before thee.<br><a name="9">9</a>  Judah [is] a lion's whelp: from the prey, my son, thou art gone up: he stooped down, he couched as a lion, and as an old lion; who shall rouse him up?<br><a name="10">10</a>  The sceptre shall not depart from Judah, nor a lawgiver from between his feet, until Shiloh come; and unto him [shall] the gathering of the people [be].<br><a name="11">11</a>  Binding his foal unto the vine, and his ass's colt unto the choice vine; he washed his garments in wine, and his clothes in the blood of grapes:<br><a name="12">12</a>  His eyes [shall be] red with wine, and his teeth white with milk.<br><a name="13">13</a>. Zebulun shall dwell at the haven of the sea; and he [shall be] for an haven of ships; and his border [shall be] unto Zidon.<br><a name="14">14</a>  Issachar [is] a strong ass couching down between two burdens:<br><a name="15">15</a>  And he saw that rest [was] good, and the land that [it was] pleasant; and bowed his shoulder to bear, and became a servant unto tribute.<br><a name="16">16</a>  Dan shall judge his people, as one of the tribes of Israel.<br><a name="17">17</a>  Dan shall be a serpent by the way, an adder in the path, that biteth the horse heels, so that his rider shall fall backward.<br><a name="18">18</a>  I have waited for thy salvation, O LORD.<br><a name="19">19</a>  Gad, a troop shall overcome him: but he shall overcome at the last.<br><a name="20">20</a>  Out of Asher his bread [shall be] fat, and he shall yield royal dainties.<br><a name="21">21</a>  Naphtali [is] a hind let loose: he giveth goodly words.<br><a name="22">22</a>. Joseph [is] a fruitful bough, [even] a fruitful bough by a well; [whose] branches run over the wall:<br><a name="23">23</a>  The archers have sorely grieved him, and shot [at him], and hated him:<br><a name="24">24</a>  But his bow abode in strength, and the arms of his hands were made strong by the hands of the mighty [God] of Jacob; (from thence [is] the shepherd, the stone of Israel:)<br><a name="25">25</a>  [Even] by the God of thy father, who shall help thee; and by the Almighty, who shall bless thee with blessings of heaven above, blessings of the deep that lieth under, blessings of the breasts, and of the womb:<br><a name="26">26</a>  The blessings of thy father have prevailed above the blessings of my progenitors unto the utmost bound of the everlasting hills: they shall be on the head of Joseph, and on the crown of the head of him that was separate from his brethren.<br><a name="27">27</a>  Benjamin shall ravin [as] a wolf: in the morning he shall devour the prey, and at night he shall divide the spoil.<br><a name="28">28</a>. All these [are] the twelve tribes of Israel: and this [is it] that their father spake unto them, and blessed them; every one according to his blessing he blessed them.<br><a name="29">29</a>  And he charged them, and said unto them, I am to be gathered unto my people: bury me with my fathers in the cave that [is] in the field of Ephron the Hittite,<br><a name="30">30</a>  In the cave that [is] in the field of Machpelah, which [is] before Mamre, in the land of Canaan, which Abraham bought with the field of Ephron the Hittite for a possession of a buryingplace.<br><a name="31">31</a>  There they buried Abraham and Sarah his wife; there they buried Isaac and Rebekah his wife; and there I buried Leah.<br><a name="32">32</a>  The purchase of the field and of the cave that [is] therein [was] from the children of Heth.<br><a name="33">33</a>  And when Jacob had made an end of commanding his sons, he gathered up his feet into the bed, and yielded up the ghost, and was gathered unto his people.<br><br>Go to <a href="gen50.htm#1">Genesis 50</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
