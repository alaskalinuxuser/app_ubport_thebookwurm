Hebrews   3<br>1. Wherefore, holy brethren, partakers of the heavenly calling, consider the Apostle and High Priest of our profession, Christ Jesus;<br><a name="2">2</a>  Who was faithful to him that appointed him, as also Moses [was faithful] in all his house.<br><a name="3">3</a>  For this [man] was counted worthy of more glory than Moses, inasmuch as he who hath builded the house hath more honour than the house.<br><a name="4">4</a>  For every house is builded by some [man]; but he that built all things [is] God.<br><a name="5">5</a>  And Moses verily [was] faithful in all his house, as a servant, for a testimony of those things which were to be spoken after;<br><a name="6">6</a>  But Christ as a son over his own house; whose house are we, if we hold fast the confidence and the rejoicing of the hope firm unto the end.<br><a name="7">7</a>. Wherefore (as the Holy Ghost saith, To day if ye will hear his voice,<br><a name="8">8</a>  Harden not your hearts, as in the provocation, in the day of temptation in the wilderness:<br><a name="9">9</a>  When your fathers tempted me, proved me, and saw my works forty years.<br><a name="10">10</a>  Wherefore I was grieved with that generation, and said, They do alway err in [their] heart; and they have not known my ways.<br><a name="11">11</a>  So I sware in my wrath, They shall not enter into my rest.)<br><a name="12">12</a>  Take heed, brethren, lest there be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief, in departing from the living God.<br><a name="13">13</a>  But exhort one another daily, while it is called To day; lest any of you be hardened through the deceitfulness of sin.<br><a name="14">14</a>  For we are made partakers of Christ, if we hold the beginning of our confidence stedfast unto the end;<br><a name="15">15</a>  While it is said, To day if ye will hear his voice, harden not your hearts, as in the provocation.<br><a name="16">16</a>  For some, when they had heard, did provoke: howbeit not all that came out of Egypt by Moses.<br><a name="17">17</a>  But with whom was he grieved forty years? [was it] not with them that had sinned, whose carcases fell in the wilderness?<br><a name="18">18</a>  And to whom sware he that they should not enter into his rest, but to them that believed not?<br><a name="19">19</a>  So we see that they could not enter in because of unbelief.<br><br>Go to <a href="heb4.htm#1">Hebrews 4</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
