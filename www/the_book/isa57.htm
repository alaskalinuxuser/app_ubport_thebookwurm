Isaiah  57<br> 1. The righteous perisheth, and no man layeth [it] to heart: and merciful men [are] taken away, none considering that the righteous is taken away from the evil [to come].<br><a name="2">2</a>  He shall enter into peace: they shall rest in their beds, [each one] walking [in] his uprightness.<br><a name="3">3</a>. But draw near hither, ye sons of the sorceress, the seed of the adulterer and the whore.<br><a name="4">4</a>  Against whom do ye sport yourselves? against whom make ye a wide mouth, [and] draw out the tongue? [are] ye not children of transgression, a seed of falsehood,<br><a name="5">5</a>  Enflaming yourselves with idols under every green tree, slaying the children in the valleys under the clifts of the rocks?<br><a name="6">6</a>  Among the smooth [stones] of the stream [is] thy portion; they, they [are] thy lot: even to them hast thou poured a drink offering, thou hast offered a meat offering. Should I receive comfort in these?<br><a name="7">7</a>  Upon a lofty and high mountain hast thou set thy bed: even thither wentest thou up to offer sacrifice.<br><a name="8">8</a>  Behind the doors also and the posts hast thou set up thy remembrance: for thou hast discovered [thyself to another] than me, and art gone up; thou hast enlarged thy bed, and made thee [a covenant] with them; thou lovedst their bed where thou sawest [it].<br><a name="9">9</a>  And thou wentest to the king with ointment, and didst increase thy perfumes, and didst send thy messengers far off, and didst debase [thyself even] unto hell.<br><a name="10">10</a>  Thou art wearied in the greatness of thy way; [yet] saidst thou not, There is no hope: thou hast found the life of thine hand; therefore thou wast not grieved.<br><a name="11">11</a>  And of whom hast thou been afraid or feared, that thou hast lied, and hast not remembered me, nor laid [it] to thy heart? have not I held my peace even of old, and thou fearest me not?<br><a name="12">12</a>  I will declare thy righteousness, and thy works; for they shall not profit thee.<br><a name="13">13</a>. When thou criest, let thy companies deliver thee; but the wind shall carry them all away; vanity shall take [them]: but he that putteth his trust in me shall possess the land, and shall inherit my holy mountain;<br><a name="14">14</a>  And shall say, Cast ye up, cast ye up, prepare the way, take up the stumblingblock out of the way of my people.<br><a name="15">15</a>  For thus saith the high and lofty One that inhabiteth eternity, whose name [is] Holy; I dwell in the high and holy [place], with him also [that is] of a contrite and humble spirit, to revive the spirit of the humble, and to revive the heart of the contrite ones.<br><a name="16">16</a>  For I will not contend for ever, neither will I be always wroth: for the spirit should fail before me, and the souls [which] I have made.<br><a name="17">17</a>. For the iniquity of his covetousness was I wroth, and smote him: I hid me, and was wroth, and he went on frowardly in the way of his heart.<br><a name="18">18</a>  I have seen his ways, and will heal him: I will lead him also, and restore comforts unto him and to his mourners.<br><a name="19">19</a>  I create the fruit of the lips; Peace, peace to [him that is] far off, and to [him that is] near, saith the LORD; and I will heal him.<br><a name="20">20</a>  But the wicked [are] like the troubled sea, when it cannot rest, whose waters cast up mire and dirt.<br><a name="21">21</a>  [There is] no peace, saith my God, to the wicked.<br><br>Go to <a href="isa58.htm#1">Isaiah 58</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
