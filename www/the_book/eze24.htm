Ezekiel  24<br>1. Again in the ninth year, in the tenth month, in the tenth [day] of the month, the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,<br><a name="2">2</a>  Son of man, write thee the name of the day, [even] of this same day: the king of Babylon set himself against Jerusalem this same day.<br><a name="3">3</a>  And utter a parable unto the rebellious house, and say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Set on a pot, set [it] on, and also pour water into it:<br><a name="4">4</a>  Gather the pieces thereof into it, [even] every good piece, the thigh, and the shoulder; fill [it] with the choice bones.<br><a name="5">5</a>  Take the choice of the flock, and burn also the bones under it, [and] make it boil well, and let them seethe the bones of it therein.<br><a name="6">6</a>  Wherefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Woe to the bloody city, to the pot whose scum [is] therein, and whose scum is not gone out of it! bring it out piece by piece; let no lot fall upon it.<br><a name="7">7</a>  For her blood is in the midst of her; she set it upon the top of a rock; she poured it not upon the ground, to cover it with dust;<br><a name="8">8</a>  That it might cause fury to come up to take vengeance; I have set her blood upon the top of a rock, that it should not be covered.<br><a name="9">9</a>  Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Woe to the bloody city! I will even make the pile for fire great.<br><a name="10">10</a>  Heap on wood, kindle the fire, consume the flesh, and spice it well, and let the bones be burned.<br><a name="11">11</a>  Then set it empty upon the coals thereof, that the brass of it may be hot, and may burn, and [that] the filthiness of it may be molten in it, [that] the scum of it may be consumed.<br><a name="12">12</a>  She hath wearied [herself] with lies, and her great scum went not forth out of her: her scum [shall be] in the fire.<br><a name="13">13</a>  In thy filthiness [is] lewdness: because I have purged thee, and thou wast not purged, thou shalt not be purged from thy filthiness any more, till I have caused my fury to rest upon thee.<br><a name="14">14</a>  I the LORD have spoken [it]: it shall come to pass, and I will do [it]; I will not go back, neither will I spare, neither will I repent; according to thy ways, and according to thy doings, shall they judge thee, saith the Lord GOD.<br><a name="15">15</a>. Also the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,<br><a name="16">16</a>  Son of man, behold, I take away from thee the desire of thine eyes with a stroke: yet neither shalt thou mourn nor weep, neither shall thy tears run down.<br><a name="17">17</a>  Forbear to cry, make no mourning for the dead, bind the tire of thine head upon thee, and put on thy shoes upon thy feet, and cover not [thy] lips, and eat not the bread of men.<br><a name="18">18</a>  So I spake unto the people in the morning: and at even my wife died; and I did in the morning as I was commanded.<br><a name="19">19</a>  And the people said unto me, Wilt thou not tell us what these [things are] to us, that thou doest [so]?<br><a name="20">20</a>  Then I answered them, The word of the LORD came unto me, saying,<br><a name="21">21</a>  Speak unto the house of Israel, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I will profane my sanctuary, the excellency of your strength, the desire of your eyes, and that which your soul pitieth; and your sons and your daughters whom ye have left shall fall by the sword.<br><a name="22">22</a>  And ye shall do as I have done: ye shall not cover [your] lips, nor eat the bread of men.<br><a name="23">23</a>  And your tires [shall be] upon your heads, and your shoes upon your feet: ye shall not mourn nor weep; but ye shall pine away for your iniquities, and mourn one toward another.<br><a name="24">24</a>  Thus Ezekiel is unto you a sign: according to all that he hath done shall ye do: and when this cometh, ye shall know that I [am] the Lord GOD.<br><a name="25">25</a>  Also, thou son of man, [shall it] not [be] in the day when I take from them their strength, the joy of their glory, the desire of their eyes, and that whereupon they set their minds, their sons and their daughters,<br><a name="26">26</a>  [That] he that escapeth in that day shall come unto thee, to cause [thee] to hear [it] with [thine] ears?<br><a name="27">27</a>  In that day shall thy mouth be opened to him which is escaped, and thou shalt speak, and be no more dumb: and thou shalt be a sign unto them; and they shall know that I [am] the LORD.<br><br>Go to <a href="eze25.htm#1">Ezekiel 25</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
