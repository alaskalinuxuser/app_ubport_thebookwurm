Psalms  80<br> 1. To the chief Musician upon Shoshannimeduth, A Psalm of Asaph. Give ear, O Shepherd of Israel, thou that leadest Joseph like a flock; thou that dwellest [between] the cherubims, shine forth.<br><a name="2">2</a>  Before Ephraim and Benjamin and Manasseh stir up thy strength, and come [and] save us.<br><a name="3">3</a>  Turn us again, O God, and cause thy face to shine; and we shall be saved.<br><a name="4">4</a>  O LORD God of hosts, how long wilt thou be angry against the prayer of thy people?<br><a name="5">5</a>  Thou feedest them with the bread of tears; and givest them tears to drink in great measure.<br><a name="6">6</a>  Thou makest us a strife unto our neighbours: and our enemies laugh among themselves.<br><a name="7">7</a>  Turn us again, O God of hosts, and cause thy face to shine; and we shall be saved.<br><a name="8">8</a>. Thou hast brought a vine out of Egypt: thou hast cast out the heathen, and planted it.<br><a name="9">9</a>  Thou preparedst [room] before it, and didst cause it to take deep root, and it filled the land.<br><a name="10">10</a>  The hills were covered with the shadow of it, and the boughs thereof [were like] the goodly cedars.<br><a name="11">11</a>  She sent out her boughs unto the sea, and her branches unto the river.<br><a name="12">12</a>  Why hast thou [then] broken down her hedges, so that all they which pass by the way do pluck her?<br><a name="13">13</a>  The boar out of the wood doth waste it, and the wild beast of the field doth devour it.<br><a name="14">14</a>  Return, we beseech thee, O God of hosts: look down from heaven, and behold, and visit this vine;<br><a name="15">15</a>  And the vineyard which thy right hand hath planted, and the branch [that] thou madest strong for thyself.<br><a name="16">16</a>  [It is] burned with fire, [it is] cut down: they perish at the rebuke of thy countenance.<br><a name="17">17</a>  Let thy hand be upon the man of thy right hand, upon the son of man [whom] thou madest strong for thyself.<br><a name="18">18</a>  So will not we go back from thee: quicken us, and we will call upon thy name.<br><a name="19">19</a>  Turn us again, O LORD God of hosts, cause thy face to shine; and we shall be saved.<br><br>Go to <a href="psa81.htm#1">Psalm 81</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
