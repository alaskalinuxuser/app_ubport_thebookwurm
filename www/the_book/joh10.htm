Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that entereth not by the door into the sheepfold, but climbeth up some other way, the same is a thief and a robber.<br><a name="2">2</a>  But he that entereth in by the door is the shepherd of the sheep.<br><a name="3">3</a>  To him the porter openeth; and the sheep hear his voice: and he calleth his own sheep by name, and leadeth them out.<br><a name="4">4</a>  And when he putteth forth his own sheep, he goeth before them, and the sheep follow him: for they know his voice.<br><a name="5">5</a>  And a stranger will they not follow, but will flee from him: for they know not the voice of strangers.<br><a name="6">6</a>  This parable spake Jesus unto them: but they understood not what things they were which he spake unto them.<br><a name="7">7</a>  Then said Jesus unto them again, Verily, verily, I say unto you, I am the door of the sheep.<br><a name="8">8</a>  All that ever came before me are thieves and robbers: but the sheep did not hear them.<br><a name="9">9</a>  I am the door: by me if any man enter in, he shall be saved, and shall go in and out, and find pasture.<br><a name="10">10</a>  The thief cometh not, but for to steal, and to kill, and to destroy: I am come that they might have life, and that they might have [it] more abundantly.<br><a name="11">11</a>  I am the good shepherd: the good shepherd giveth his life for the sheep.<br><a name="12">12</a>  But he that is an hireling, and not the shepherd, whose own the sheep are not, seeth the wolf coming, and leaveth the sheep, and fleeth: and the wolf catcheth them, and scattereth the sheep.<br><a name="13">13</a>  The hireling fleeth, because he is an hireling, and careth not for the sheep.<br><a name="14">14</a>  I am the good shepherd, and know my [sheep], and am known of mine.<br><a name="15">15</a>  As the Father knoweth me, even so know I the Father: and I lay down my life for the sheep.<br><a name="16">16</a>  And other sheep I have, which are not of this fold: them also I must bring, and they shall hear my voice; and there shall be one fold, [and] one shepherd.<br><a name="17">17</a>  Therefore doth my Father love me, because I lay down my life, that I might take it again.<br><a name="18">18</a>  No man taketh it from me, but I lay it down of myself. I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it again. This commandment have I received of my Father.<br><a name="19">19</a>. There was a division therefore again among the Jews for these sayings.<br><a name="20">20</a>  And many of them said, He hath a devil, and is mad; why hear ye him?<br><a name="21">21</a>  Others said, These are not the words of him that hath a devil. Can a devil open the eyes of the blind?<br><a name="22">22</a>. And it was at Jerusalem the feast of the dedication, and it was winter.<br><a name="23">23</a>  And Jesus walked in the temple in Solomon's porch.<br><a name="24">24</a>  Then came the Jews round about him, and said unto him, How long dost thou make us to doubt? If thou be the Christ, tell us plainly.<br><a name="25">25</a>  Jesus answered them, I told you, and ye believed not: the works that I do in my Father's name, they bear witness of me.<br><a name="26">26</a>  But ye believe not, because ye are not of my sheep, as I said unto you.<br><a name="27">27</a>  My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me:<br><a name="28">28</a>  And I give unto them eternal life; and they shall never perish, neither shall any [man] pluck them out of my hand.<br><a name="29">29</a>  My Father, which gave [them] me, is greater than all; and no [man] is able to pluck [them] out of my Father's hand.<br><a name="30">30</a>  I and [my] Father are one.<br><a name="31">31</a>  Then the Jews took up stones again to stone him.<br><a name="32">32</a>  Jesus answered them, Many good works have I shewed you from my Father; for which of those works do ye stone me?<br><a name="33">33</a>  The Jews answered him, saying, For a good work we stone thee not; but for blasphemy; and because that thou, being a man, makest thyself God.<br><a name="34">34</a>  Jesus answered them, Is it not written in your law, I said, Ye are gods?<br><a name="35">35</a>  If he called them gods, unto whom the word of God came, and the scripture cannot be broken;<br><a name="36">36</a>  Say ye of him, whom the Father hath sanctified, and sent into the world, Thou blasphemest; because I said, I am the Son of God?<br><a name="37">37</a>  If I do not the works of my Father, believe me not.<br><a name="38">38</a>  But if I do, though ye believe not me, believe the works: that ye may know, and believe, that the Father [is] in me, and I in him.<br><a name="39">39</a>. Therefore they sought again to take him: but he escaped out of their hand,<br><a name="40">40</a>  And went away again beyond Jordan into the place where John at first baptized; and there he abode.<br><a name="41">41</a>  And many resorted unto him, and said, John did no miracle: but all things that John spake of this man were true.<br><a name="42">42</a>  And many believed on him there.<br><br>Go to <a href="joh11.htm#1">John 11</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
