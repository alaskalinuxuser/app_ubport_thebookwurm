<b><i>10:7 And the sons of Cush; Seba, and Havilah, and Sabtah, and Raamah, and Sabtecha: <dd>and the sons of Raamah; Sheba, and Dedan.<dt><a name="8"></a>
10:8 And Cush begat Nimrod: <br>
he began to be a mighty one in the earth.<br>
10:9 He was a mighty hunter before the LORD: <br>
wherefore it is said, Even as Nimrod the mighty hunter before the LORD.<br>
10:10 And the beginning of his kingdom was Babel, <br>
and Erech, and Accad, and Calneh, in the land of Shinar </b></i>{<a href="mic5.htm#6">Mic 5:6</a>; <a href="gen11.htm#2">Gen 11:2</a>}<i><b>.<br>
10:11 Out of that land went forth Asshur, and builded Nineveh, and the city Rehoboth, and Calah,<br>
10:12 And Resen between Nineveh and Calah: the same [is] a great city.</b></i></dt><dl>
<dt>out of that land went forth Asshur...-
<dd>Asshur was a son of Shem (<a href="gen10.htm#22" target="lwr_lt">v.22</a>), who populated the region of Assyria (which takes its name from Asshur). The interaction with the land of Nimrod indicates the historic influence of that geographic region, and the political &amp; religious influence of Nimrod on other people groups.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, since these verses (v.8-12) focus on the exploits of Nimrod, an alternate reading is preferrable here:<br>'...from that land he went forth into Assyria...' [NASB]&nbsp; That is, Nimrod moved, from the region of Cush, north to Assyria, and there built the city of Nineveh.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some archaeologists believe that Nimrod was Sargon the Great, whose kingdom began in the Mesopotamian city of Kish {the name is derived from Cush} and expanded northwestward, up the Tigris and Euphrates valleys and into Assyria. (Note that Babylon and Kish are in close proximity.)
<dt>Nimrod the mighty hunter before the LORD (<a href="gen10.htm#9" target="lwr_lt">v.9</a>)- This title is <i>not</i> favorable.
<dd>Nimrod founded a corrupt religious system which drew men away from the LORD, at the peril of their eternal souls. Later, the practice of this false religion (Baal &amp; Ashtaroth worship) was a factor in the corruption of Israel. cp. <a href="eze13.htm#17">Eze 13:17-23</a>
<dt>the beginning of his kingdom was Babel - ie., Babylon. (<a href="gen10.htm#10" target="lwr_lt">v.10</a>; <a href="gen11.htm#9">11:9</a>)
<dd>This is the first mention of Babylon in the Bible. Babylon (as a corrupt system, extending beyond the original geographic area) remains a dominent influence in the world until the second coming of Christ (<a href="rev18.htm#1">Rev 18:1-3,21-24</a>).<br>
''Whenever God has a corporate witness on earth, Satan has a Babylon to mar and corrupt that witness. When God connects His name to a city, Babylon takes the form of a city. When God connects His name to a Church, Babylon is a corrupt religious system.'' [CHM]<br>(For more, see the <a href="rev2an.htm#20" target="lwr_lt">Notes at Rev 2:20</a>.)</dl>

10:24 And Arphaxad begat Salah; and Salah begat Eber </b></i>{'Hebrew' derives from his name}<i><b>.
<dd>10:25 And unto Eber were born two sons: <br>
the name of one [was] Peleg; for in his days was the earth divided; <br>
and his brother's name [was] Joktan </b></i> {progenitor of several Arabian tribes}.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peleg means 'division.' The division of people groups, by the confusion of language (ch.11),<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;occurred 'in his days' (probably around the time of his birth).<i><b>
<dd>10:26 And Joktan begat Almodad, and Sheleph, and Hazarmaveth, and Jerah,<br>
10:27 And Hadoram, and Uzal, and Diklah,<br>

<dt>10:31 These [are] the sons of Shem, after their families, after their tongues, in their lands, after their nations.</b></i></dt><dl>
<dt>Someone may ask: ''From whom are 'the Arabs' descended?''
<dd>'The Arab Nation' is a relatively recent development. In the sixth &amp; seventh centuries A.D., Muslim invasions, from the Arabian Penninsula, spread the Arabic language and the Islamic religion across regions occupied by various people groups (eg., into northern Africa, Asia Minor, and the Persian Gulf). The common language, rather than a common ancestry defines the Arab world.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After Babel, the Arabic language may have been spoken first by descendants of Joktan (<a href="gen10.htm#26" target="lwr_lt">v.26</a>), who is probably the 'Qahtan' from whom some Arab tribes claim descendence. Ishmael is also regarded as the ancestor of some Arab tribes (<a href="gen25.htm#12">Gen 25:12-18</a>).</dl><dt><b><i>
