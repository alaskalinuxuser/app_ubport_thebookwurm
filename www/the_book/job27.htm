Job  27<br>1. Moreover Job continued his parable, and said,<br><a name="2">2</a>  [As] God liveth, [who] hath taken away my judgment; and the Almighty, [who] hath vexed my soul;<br><a name="3">3</a>  All the while my breath [is] in me, and the spirit of God [is] in my nostrils;<br><a name="4">4</a>  My lips shall not speak wickedness, nor my tongue utter deceit.<br><a name="5">5</a>  God forbid that I should justify you: till I die I will not remove mine integrity from me.<br><a name="6">6</a>  My righteousness I hold fast, and will not let it go: my heart shall not reproach [me] so long as I live.<br><a name="7">7</a>. Let mine enemy be as the wicked, and he that riseth up against me as the unrighteous.<br><a name="8">8</a>  For what [is] the hope of the hypocrite, though he hath gained, when God taketh away his soul?<br><a name="9">9</a>  Will God hear his cry when trouble cometh upon him?<br><a name="10">10</a>  Will he delight himself in the Almighty? will he always call upon God?<br><a name="11">11</a>. I will teach you by the hand of God: [that] which [is] with the Almighty will I not conceal.<br><a name="12">12</a>  Behold, all ye yourselves have seen [it]; why then are ye thus altogether vain?<br><a name="13">13</a>  This [is] the portion of a wicked man with God, and the heritage of oppressors, [which] they shall receive of the Almighty.<br><a name="14">14</a>  If his children be multiplied, [it is] for the sword: and his offspring shall not be satisfied with bread.<br><a name="15">15</a>  Those that remain of him shall be buried in death: and his widows shall not weep.<br><a name="16">16</a>  Though he heap up silver as the dust, and prepare raiment as the clay;<br><a name="17">17</a>  He may prepare [it], but the just shall put [it] on, and the innocent shall divide the silver.<br><a name="18">18</a>  He buildeth his house as a moth, and as a booth [that] the keeper maketh.<br><a name="19">19</a>  The rich man shall lie down, but he shall not be gathered: he openeth his eyes, and he [is] not.<br><a name="20">20</a>  Terrors take hold on him as waters, a tempest stealeth him away in the night.<br><a name="21">21</a>  The east wind carrieth him away, and he departeth: and as a storm hurleth him out of his place.<br><a name="22">22</a>  For [God] shall cast upon him, and not spare: he would fain flee out of his hand.<br><a name="23">23</a>  [Men] shall clap their hands at him, and shall hiss him out of his place.<br><br>Go to <a href="job28.htm#1">Job 28</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
