Psalms  16<br> 1. Michtam of David. Preserve me, O God: for in thee do I put my trust.<br><a name="2">2</a>  [O my soul], thou hast said unto the LORD, Thou [art] my Lord: my goodness [extendeth] not to thee;<br><a name="3">3</a>  [But] to the saints that [are] in the earth, and [to] the excellent, in whom [is] all my delight.<br><a name="4">4</a>  Their sorrows shall be multiplied [that] hasten [after] another [god]: their drink offerings of blood will I not offer, nor take up their names into my lips.<br><a name="5">5</a>  The LORD [is] the portion of mine inheritance and of my cup: thou maintainest my lot.<br><a name="6">6</a>  The lines are fallen unto me in pleasant [places]; yea, I have a goodly heritage.<br><a name="7">7</a>  I will bless the LORD, who hath given me counsel: my reins also instruct me in the night seasons.<br><a name="8">8</a>. I have set the LORD always before me: because [he is] at my right hand, I shall not be moved.<br><a name="9">9</a>  Therefore my heart is glad, and my glory rejoiceth: my flesh also shall rest in hope.<br><a name="10">10</a>  For thou wilt not leave my soul in hell; neither wilt thou suffer thine Holy One to see corruption.<br><a name="11">11</a>  Thou wilt shew me the path of life: in thy presence [is] fulness of joy; at thy right hand [there are] pleasures for evermore.<br><br>Go to <a href="psa17.htm#1">Psalm 17</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
