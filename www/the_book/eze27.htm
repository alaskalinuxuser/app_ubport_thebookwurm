Ezekiel  27<br>1. The word of the LORD came again unto me, saying,<br><a name="2">2</a>  Now, thou son of man, take up a lamentation for Tyrus;<br><a name="3">3</a>  And say unto Tyrus, O thou that art situate at the entry of the sea, [which art] a merchant of the people for many isles, Thus saith the Lord GOD; O Tyrus, thou hast said, I [am] of perfect beauty.<br><a name="4">4</a>  Thy borders [are] in the midst of the seas, thy builders have perfected thy beauty.<br><a name="5">5</a>  They have made all thy [ship] boards of fir trees of Senir: they have taken cedars from Lebanon to make masts for thee.<br><a name="6">6</a>  [Of] the oaks of Bashan have they made thine oars; the company of the Ashurites have made thy benches [of] ivory, [brought] out of the isles of Chittim.<br><a name="7">7</a>  Fine linen with broidered work from Egypt was that which thou spreadest forth to be thy sail; blue and purple from the isles of Elishah was that which covered thee.<br><a name="8">8</a>  The inhabitants of Zidon and Arvad were thy mariners: thy wise [men], O Tyrus, [that] were in thee, were thy pilots.<br><a name="9">9</a>  The ancients of Gebal and the wise [men] thereof were in thee thy calkers: all the ships of the sea with their mariners were in thee to occupy thy merchandise.<br><a name="10">10</a>  They of Persia and of Lud and of Phut were in thine army, thy men of war: they hanged the shield and helmet in thee; they set forth thy comeliness.<br><a name="11">11</a>  The men of Arvad with thine army [were] upon thy walls round about, and the Gammadims were in thy towers: they hanged their shields upon thy walls round about; they have made thy beauty perfect.<br><a name="12">12</a>  Tarshish [was] thy merchant by reason of the multitude of all [kind of] riches; with silver, iron, tin, and lead, they traded in thy fairs.<br><a name="13">13</a>  Javan, Tubal, and Meshech, they [were] thy merchants: they traded the persons of men and vessels of brass in thy market.<br><a name="14">14</a>  They of the house of Togarmah traded in thy fairs with horses and horsemen and mules.<br><a name="15">15</a>  The men of Dedan [were] thy merchants; many isles [were] the merchandise of thine hand: they brought thee [for] a present horns of ivory and ebony.<br><a name="16">16</a>  Syria [was] thy merchant by reason of the multitude of the wares of thy making: they occupied in thy fairs with emeralds, purple, and broidered work, and fine linen, and coral, and agate.<br><a name="17">17</a>  Judah, and the land of Israel, they [were] thy merchants: they traded in thy market wheat of Minnith, and Pannag, and honey, and oil, and balm.<br><a name="18">18</a>  Damascus [was] thy merchant in the multitude of the wares of thy making, for the multitude of all riches; in the wine of Helbon, and white wool.<br><a name="19">19</a>  Dan also and Javan going to and fro occupied in thy fairs: bright iron, cassia, and calamus, were in thy market.<br><a name="20">20</a>  Dedan [was] thy merchant in precious clothes for chariots.<br><a name="21">21</a>  Arabia, and all the princes of Kedar, they occupied with thee in lambs, and rams, and goats: in these [were they] thy merchants.<br><a name="22">22</a>  The merchants of Sheba and Raamah, they [were] thy merchants: they occupied in thy fairs with chief of all spices, and with all precious stones, and gold.<br><a name="23">23</a>  Haran, and Canneh, and Eden, the merchants of Sheba, Asshur, [and] Chilmad, [were] thy merchants.<br><a name="24">24</a>  These [were] thy merchants in all sorts [of things], in blue clothes, and broidered work, and in chests of rich apparel, bound with cords, and made of cedar, among thy merchandise.<br><a name="25">25</a>  The ships of Tarshish did sing of thee in thy market: and thou wast replenished, and made very glorious in the midst of the seas.<br><a name="26">26</a>. Thy rowers have brought thee into great waters: the east wind hath broken thee in the midst of the seas.<br><a name="27">27</a>  Thy riches, and thy fairs, thy merchandise, thy mariners, and thy pilots, thy calkers, and the occupiers of thy merchandise, and all thy men of war, that [are] in thee, and in all thy company which [is] in the midst of thee, shall fall into the midst of the seas in the day of thy ruin.<br><a name="28">28</a>  The suburbs shall shake at the sound of the cry of thy pilots.<br><a name="29">29</a>  And all that handle the oar, the mariners, [and] all the pilots of the sea, shall come down from their ships, they shall stand upon the land;<br><a name="30">30</a>  And shall cause their voice to be heard against thee, and shall cry bitterly, and shall cast up dust upon their heads, they shall wallow themselves in the ashes:<br><a name="31">31</a>  And they shall make themselves utterly bald for thee, and gird them with sackcloth, and they shall weep for thee with bitterness of heart [and] bitter wailing.<br><a name="32">32</a>  And in their wailing they shall take up a lamentation for thee, and lament over thee, [saying], What [city is] like Tyrus, like the destroyed in the midst of the sea?<br><a name="33">33</a>  When thy wares went forth out of the seas, thou filledst many people; thou didst enrich the kings of the earth with the multitude of thy riches and of thy merchandise.<br><a name="34">34</a>  In the time [when] thou shalt be broken by the seas in the depths of the waters thy merchandise and all thy company in the midst of thee shall fall.<br><a name="35">35</a>  All the inhabitants of the isles shall be astonished at thee, and their kings shall be sore afraid, they shall be troubled in [their] countenance.<br><a name="36">36</a>  The merchants among the people shall hiss at thee; thou shalt be a terror, and never [shalt be] any more.<br><br>Go to <a href="eze28.htm#1">Ezekiel 28</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
