<h2>Faith and Works</h2></center>
<p>Faith and works are both divinely appointed, and are both found in every true believer, but each has its own place and use. The believer is <i>saved</i> by faith, and <i>rewarded</i> according to his works.</p>
<b><ol type="A">
<li>Faith</b><ol type="1">
<li>The importance of faith<ul>
<li><a href="heb11.htm#6">Hebrews 11:6</a> - &quot;Without faith it is impossible to please Him&quot;<br>Without faith, we may be friendly, generous, and moral. We may even please men, but we cannot please God.</ul>
<li>What is faith?<ul>
<li><a href="rom4.htm#3">Romans 4:3,20,21</a> - &quot;Abraham believed God.&quot; He took God at His word.
<li><a href="act27.htm#21">Acts 27:21-25</a> - &quot;For I believe God.&quot; An illustration of Paul's faith.</ul>
<li>Saving faith is believing the record God gave of His Son<ul>
<li><a href="1joh5.htm#10">1John 5:10-12</a> - &quot;This is the record, that God hath given to us eternal life, and this life is in His Son.&quot; Belief <i>in</i>, not just knowledge <i>of.</i> 
<li><a href="eph1.htm#12">Ephesians 1:12</a> - &quot;Trusted in Christ&quot;
<li><a href="rom10.htm#9">Romans 10:9,10</a> - &quot;With the heart man believeth&quot;</ul>
<li>What faith does<ul>
<li><a href="luk7.htm#50">Luke 7:50</a> - &quot;Faith hath saved thee&quot;
<li><a href="eph3.htm#17">Ephesians 3:17</a> - &quot;That Christ may dwell in your hearts&quot;
<li><a href="joh3.htm#16">John 3:16</a> - &quot;Have everlasting life&quot;
<li><a href="rom5.htm#1">Romans 5:1</a> - &quot;Being justified by faith, we have peace with God&quot;
<li><a href="joh6.htm#47">John 6:47</a> - &quot;He that believeth... hath everlasting life&quot;
<li><a href="eph2.htm#8">Ephesians 2:8</a> - &quot;Saved through faith&quot;</ul></ol><b>
<li>Works</b><ol type="1">
<li>What works cannot do<ul>
<li><a href="eph2.htm#8">Ephesians 2:8,9</a> - &quot;Saved through faith... not of works&quot;
<li><a href="gal2.htm#21">Galatians 2:21</a> - &quot;If righteousness come by the law [works], then Christ is dead in vain&quot;
<li><a href="rom3.htm#20">Romans 3:20</a> - &quot;By the deeds of the law... no flesh be justified&quot;
<li><a href="act13.htm#39">Acts 13:39</a> - &quot;Ye could not be justified by the law&quot;</ul>
<li>The right place for good works<ul>
<li><a href="tit3.htm#8">Titus 3:8</a> - &quot;Be careful to maintain good works&quot; <li><a href="eph2.htm#10">Ephesians 2:10</a> - &quot;Created in Christ Jesus unto good works... that we should walk in them&quot;</ul>
<li>The profit of good works<ul>
<li><a href="1cor3.htm#11">1Corinthians 3:11-15</a> - &quot;He shall receive a reward&quot;
<li><a href="mat25.htm#21">Matthew 25:21</a> - &quot;Make thee ruler over many things&quot;
<li><a href="mat10.htm#42">Matthew 10:42</a> - &quot;He shall in no wise loose his reward&quot;</ul></ol>
<p>Believers are not saved by works, but wholly by faith. Yet, it is true that they are rewarded in heaven according to their works.</p></ol>
