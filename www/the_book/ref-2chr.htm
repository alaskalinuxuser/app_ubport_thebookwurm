<center><b>The Old Testament Presents... Reflections of Christ</b><br>
by Paul R. Van Gorder</center>
<dt><b><a href="2chr1.htm#1" target="lwr_lt">2 CHRONICLES</a></b>
<dd>This book, a continuation of the story of 1Chronicles, is confined to the story of the house of David. The emphasis is upon the religious history of David's successors rather than the political occurrences, and it covers a period of more than 400 years. The history focuses upon the temple, beginning with the ascension of Solomon to the throne, and ending with desolation and the captivity. In typological teaching, a considerable portion of the book sets forth the millennial reign of Christ on the earth. In this connection, we read of silver, atonement money, and also of the altar and veil.<br>
<dt><b>OUTLINE OF THE BOOK--</b><ol type="I">
<li>The Reign of Solomon (<a href="2chr1.htm#1" target="lwr_lt">2Chr 1-9</a>)<dd>Since nothing is said in 2Chronicles of Solomon's sensuality, sin, and failure, his reign is a picture of the glorious rule of David's greater Son, the Lord Jesus, in the millennial kingdom.<dt>
<li>The Rebellion of the Ten Tribes (<a href="2chr10.htm#1" target="lwr_lt">10</a>)<dd>After Solomon died, his son Rehoboam ascended the throne. A series of foolish decisions led to the dividing of the kingdom. The reuniting of Judah and Israel will take place when Israel is restored. (See <a href="isa11.htm#10">Isaiah 11:10-13</a>; <a href="jer23.htm#5">Jeremiah 23:5,6</a>; and <a href="eze37.htm#15">Ezekiel 37:15-28</a>.)<dt>
<li>The Kings of Judah (<a href="2chr11.htm#1" target="lwr_lt">11-36</a>)<dd>The period from Solomon to the Babylonian captivity was characterized by moral declension and apostasy, except for five revivals. It is noteworthy that each of these revivals began at the house of God and with the Word of God. They are:<ol type="A">
<li>Asa's renewal of the altar (<a href="2chr15.htm#1" target="lwr_lt">15</a>). The place of sacrifice had fallen into disuse during Asa's father's reign. The word of the Lord through Obed stirred him to restore it.
<li>Jehoshaphat's establishment of missions (<a href="2chr17.htm#1" target="lwr_lt">17</a>). <br>This suggests that the Word of God was not known throughout the kingdom.
<li>Joash's repair of the temple for worship (<a href="2chr23.htm#1" target="lwr_lt">23,24</a>). <br>The place of worship had become dilapidated by misuse and disuse.
<li>Hezekiah's opening of the temple for worship (<a href="2chr29.htm#1" target="lwr_lt">29-31</a>). <br>God's house had been closed under wicked king Ahaz.
<li>Josiah's discovery of the ''book of the law'' (<a href="2chr34.htm#1" target="lwr_lt">34,35</a>). This demonstrates how sad the spiritual condition of Judah was at that time. The Word of God had been lost in a closed and mutilated temple. It was forgotten until uncovered during repairs.</ol><dt>
<li>The Captivity (<a href="2chr36.htm#15" target="lwr_lt">36:15-23</a>).<dd>Sporadic, temporary revivals do not hold the people for God. The patience of God with His people at last came to an end. The book begins with the splendor of Solomon, and closes with the devastating captivity of Israel. This illustrates that the very best that man can achieve in his own strength is doomed to failure.</ol>
<dt><b>SOME BRIGHT SPOTS--</b>
<dd>The revivals were encouraging interludes in Judah's history, and one of these is reported in <a href="2chr34.htm#1" target="lwr_lt">chapter 34</a>. Josiah longed for fellowship with God. He was not particularly following David's example, or Hezekiah's, but he sought ''the God of David.'' As a result of this choice, there were four years of silence, study, devotion and prayer. The law of cause and effect was at work here. The nearer he got to God, the more his eyes were opened to the idolatry of Judah. When Isaiah saw the Lord, he said, ''Send me'' (<a href="isa6.htm#8">Isa 6:8</a>). Likewise, after Josiah found God, he was willing to work for the Lord.<br><br>
While cleaning the temple, the workmen made a remarkable discovery. They found a copy of the Law of Moses that had been lost right in the temple! This was the very place [where] it was supposed to be displayed and read. When the Bible is neglected, idolatry of some form always develops.<br><br>
When the sacred writings were read in the presence of Josiah, he tore his clothes in conviction of sin. He then initiated sweeping reforms throughout the kingdom. The worship of God, including the celebration of the Passover, was resumed.<br><br>
Illumination comes through recognition of duty and [through] obedience to God. ''I being in the way, the Lord led me...'' (<a href="gen24.htm#27">Gen 24:27</a>). God revealed, to Josiah, the coming judgment upon Judah (<a href="2chr34.htm#24" target="lwr_lt">2Chr 34:24-28</a>). The only remedy for apostasy is judgment.<br>
<dt><b>MESSIANIC NOTE--</b>
<dd>Speaking of Himself, our Lord said to the scribes and Pharisees, ''Behold, a greater than Solomon is here'' (<a href="mat12.htm#42">Mat 12:42</a>). The coming earthly reign of the Lord Jesus Christ will far outshine the riches and glory of Solomon's day.
