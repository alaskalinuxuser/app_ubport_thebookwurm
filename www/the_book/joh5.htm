After this there was a feast of the Jews; and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.<br><a name="2">2</a>  Now there is at Jerusalem by the sheep [market] a pool, which is called in the Hebrew tongue Bethesda, having five porches.<br><a name="3">3</a>  In these lay a great multitude of impotent folk, of blind, halt, withered, waiting for the moving of the water.<br><a name="4">4</a>  For an angel went down at a certain season into the pool, and troubled the water: whosoever then first after the troubling of the water stepped in was made whole of whatsoever disease he had.<br><a name="5">5</a>  And a certain man was there, which had an infirmity thirty and eight years.<br><a name="6">6</a>  When Jesus saw him lie, and knew that he had been now a long time [in that case], he saith unto him, Wilt thou be made whole?<br><a name="7">7</a>  The impotent man answered him, Sir, I have no man, when the water is troubled, to put me into the pool: but while I am coming, another steppeth down before me.<br><a name="8">8</a>  Jesus saith unto him, Rise, take up thy bed, and walk.<br><a name="9">9</a>  And immediately the man was made whole, and took up his bed, and walked: and on the same day was the sabbath.<br><a name="10">10</a>  The Jews therefore said unto him that was cured, It is the sabbath day: it is not lawful for thee to carry [thy] bed.<br> <a name="11"></a>11  He answered them, He that made me whole, the same said unto me, Take up thy bed, and walk.<br><a name="12">12</a>  Then asked they him, What man is that which said unto thee, Take up thy bed, and walk?<br><a name="13">13</a>  And he that was healed wist not who it was: for Jesus had conveyed himself away, a multitude being in [that] place.<br><a name="14">14</a>  Afterward Jesus findeth him in the temple, and said unto him, Behold, thou art made whole: sin no more, lest a worse thing come unto thee.<br><a name="15">15</a>  The man departed, and told the Jews that it was Jesus, which had made him whole.<br><a name="16">16</a>  And therefore did the Jews persecute Jesus, and sought to slay him, because he had done these things on the sabbath day.<br><a name="17">17</a>. But Jesus answered them, My Father worketh hitherto, and I work.<br><a name="18">18</a>  Therefore the Jews sought the more to kill him, because he not only had broken the sabbath, but said also that God was his Father, making himself equal with God.<br><a name="19">19</a>  Then answered Jesus and said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, The Son can do nothing of himself, but what he seeth the Father do: for what things soever he doeth, these also doeth the Son likewise.<br><a name="20">20</a>  For the Father loveth the Son, and sheweth him all things that himself doeth: and he will shew him greater works than these, that ye may marvel.<br><a name="21">21</a>  For as the Father raiseth up the dead, and quickeneth [them]; even so the Son quickeneth whom he will.<br><a name="22">22</a>  For the Father judgeth no man, but hath committed all judgment unto the Son:<br><a name="23">23</a>  That all [men] should honour the Son, even as they honour the Father. He that honoureth not the Son honoureth not the Father which hath sent him.<br><a name="24">24</a>  Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that heareth my word, and believeth on him that sent me, hath everlasting life, and shall not come into condemnation; but is passed from death unto life.<br><a name="25">25</a>  Verily, verily, I say unto you, The hour is coming, and now is, when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God: and they that hear shall live.<br><a name="26">26</a>  For as the Father hath life in himself; so hath he given to the Son to have life in himself;<br><a name="27">27</a>  And hath given him authority to execute judgment also, because he is the Son of man.<br><a name="28">28</a>  Marvel not at this: for the hour is coming, in the which all that are in the graves shall hear his voice,<br><a name="29">29</a>  And shall come forth; they that have done good, unto the resurrection of life; and they that have done evil, unto the resurrection of damnation.<br><a name="30">30</a>  I can of mine own self do nothing: as I hear, I judge: and my judgment is just; because I seek not mine own will, but the will of the Father which hath sent me.<br><a name="31">31</a>. If I bear witness of myself, my witness is not true.<br><a name="32">32</a>  There is another that beareth witness of me; and I know that the witness which he witnesseth of me is true.<br><a name="33">33</a>  Ye sent unto John, and he bare witness unto the truth.<br><a name="34">34</a>  But I receive not testimony from man: but these things I say, that ye might be saved.<br><a name="35">35</a>  He was a burning and a shining light: and ye were willing for a season to rejoice in his light.<br><a name="36">36</a>  But I have greater witness than [that] of John: for the works which the Father hath given me to finish, the same works that I do, bear witness of me, that the Father hath sent me.<br><a name="37">37</a>  And the Father himself, which hath sent me, hath borne witness of me. Ye have neither heard his voice at any time, nor seen his shape.<br><a name="38">38</a>  And ye have not his word abiding in you: for whom he hath sent, him ye believe not.<br> <a name="39"></a>39  Search the scriptures; for in them ye think ye have eternal life: and they are they which testify of me.<br><a name="40">40</a>  And ye will not come to me, that ye might have life.<br><a name="41">41</a>  I receive not honour from men.<br><a name="42">42</a>  But I know you, that ye have not the love of God in you.<br><a name="43">43</a>  I am come in my Father's name, and ye receive me not: if another shall come in his own name, him ye will receive.<br><a name="44">44</a>  How can ye believe, which receive honour one of another, and seek not the honour that [cometh] from God only?<br><a name="45">45</a>  Do not think that I will accuse you to the Father: there is [one] that accuseth you, [even] Moses, in whom ye trust.<br><a name="46">46</a>  For had ye believed Moses, ye would have believed me: for he wrote of me.<br><a name="47">47</a>  But if ye believe not his writings, how shall ye believe my words?<br><br>Go to <a href="joh6.htm#1">John 6</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
