Mark   7<br>1. Then came together unto him the Pharisees, and certain of the scribes, which came from Jerusalem.<br><a name="2">2</a>  And when they saw some of his disciples eat bread with defiled, that is to say, with unwashen, hands, they found fault.<br><a name="3">3</a>  For the Pharisees, and all the Jews, except they wash [their] hands oft, eat not, holding the tradition of the elders.<br><a name="4">4</a>  And [when they come] from the market, except they wash, they eat not. And many other things there be, which they have received to hold, [as] the washing of cups, and pots, brasen vessels, and of tables.<br><a name="5">5</a>  Then the Pharisees and scribes asked him, Why walk not thy disciples according to the tradition of the elders, but eat bread with unwashen hands?<br><a name="6">6</a>  He answered and said unto them, Well hath Esaias prophesied of you hypocrites, as it is written, This people honoureth me with [their] lips, but their heart is far from me.<br><a name="7">7</a>  Howbeit in vain do they worship me, teaching [for] doctrines the commandments of men.<br><a name="8">8</a>  For laying aside the commandment of God, ye hold the tradition of men, [as] the washing of pots and cups: and many other such like things ye do.<br><a name="9">9</a>  And he said unto them, Full well ye reject the commandment of God, that ye may keep your own tradition.<br><a name="10">10</a>  For Moses said, Honour thy father and thy mother; and, Whoso curseth father or mother, let him die the death:<br><a name="11">11</a>  But ye say, If a man shall say to his father or mother, [It is] Corban, that is to say, a gift, by whatsoever thou mightest be profited by me; [he shall be free].<br><a name="12">12</a>  And ye suffer him no more to do ought for his father or his mother;<br><a name="13">13</a>  Making the word of God of none effect through your tradition, which ye have delivered: and many such like things do ye.<br><a name="14">14</a>  And when he had called all the people [unto him], he said unto them, Hearken unto me every one [of you], and understand:<br><a name="15">15</a>  There is nothing from without a man, that entering into him can defile him: but the things which come out of him, those are they that defile the man.<br><a name="16">16</a>  If any man have ears to hear, let him hear.<br><a name="17">17</a>  And when he was entered into the house from the people, his disciples asked him concerning the parable.<br><a name="18">18</a>  And he saith unto them, Are ye so without understanding also? Do ye not perceive, that whatsoever thing from without entereth into the man, [it] cannot defile him;<br><a name="19">19</a>  Because it entereth not into his heart, but into the belly, and goeth out into the draught, purging all meats?<br><a name="20">20</a>  And he said, That which cometh out of the man, that defileth the man.<br><a name="21">21</a>  For from within, out of the heart of men, proceed evil thoughts, adulteries, fornications, murders,<br><a name="22">22</a>  Thefts, covetousness, wickedness, deceit, lasciviousness, an evil eye, blasphemy, pride, foolishness:<br><a name="23">23</a>  All these evil things come from within, and defile the man.<br><a name="24">24</a>. And from thence he arose, and went into the borders of Tyre and Sidon, and entered into an house, and would have no man know [it]: but he could not be hid.<br><a name="25">25</a>  For a [certain] woman, whose young daughter had an unclean spirit, heard of him, and came and fell at his feet:<br><a name="26">26</a>  The woman was a Greek, a Syrophenician by nation; and she besought him that he would cast forth the devil out of her daughter.<br><a name="27">27</a>  But Jesus said unto her, Let the children first be filled: for it is not meet to take the children's bread, and to cast [it] unto the dogs.<br><a name="28">28</a>  And she answered and said unto him, Yes, Lord: yet the dogs under the table eat of the children's crumbs.<br><a name="29">29</a>  And he said unto her, For this saying go thy way; the devil is gone out of thy daughter.<br><a name="30">30</a>  And when she was come to her house, she found the devil gone out, and her daughter laid upon the bed.<br><a name="31">31</a>. And again, departing from the coasts of Tyre and Sidon, he came unto the sea of Galilee, through the midst of the coasts of Decapolis.<br><a name="32">32</a>  And they bring unto him one that was deaf, and had an impediment in his speech; and they beseech him to put his hand upon him.<br><a name="33">33</a>  And he took him aside from the multitude, and put his fingers into his ears, and he spit, and touched his tongue;<br><a name="34">34</a>  And looking up to heaven, he sighed, and saith unto him, Ephphatha, that is, Be opened.<br><a name="35">35</a>  And straightway his ears were opened, and the string of his tongue was loosed, and he spake plain.<br><a name="36">36</a>  And he charged them that they should tell no man: but the more he charged them, so much the more a great deal they published [it];<br><a name="37">37</a>  And were beyond measure astonished, saying, He hath done all things well: he maketh both the deaf to hear, and the dumb to speak.<br><br>Go to <a href="mar8.htm#1">Mark 8</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
