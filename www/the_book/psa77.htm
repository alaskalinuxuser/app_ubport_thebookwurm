Psalms  77<br> 1. To the chief Musician, to Jeduthun, A Psalm of Asaph. I cried unto God with my voice, [even] unto God with my voice; and he gave ear unto me.<br><a name="2">2</a>  In the day of my trouble I sought the Lord: my sore ran in the night, and ceased not: my soul refused to be comforted.<br><a name="3">3</a>  I remembered God, and was troubled: I complained, and my spirit was overwhelmed. Selah.<br><a name="4">4</a>  Thou holdest mine eyes waking: I am so troubled that I cannot speak.<br><a name="5">5</a>  I have considered the days of old, the years of ancient times.<br><a name="6">6</a>  I call to remembrance my song in the night: I commune with mine own heart: and my spirit made diligent search.<br><a name="7">7</a>  Will the Lord cast off for ever? and will he be favourable no more?<br><a name="8">8</a>  Is his mercy clean gone for ever? doth [his] promise fail for evermore?<br><a name="9">9</a>  Hath God forgotten to be gracious? hath he in anger shut up his tender mercies? Selah.<br><a name="10">10</a>  And I said, This [is] my infirmity: [but I will remember] the years of the right hand of the most High.<br><a name="11">11</a>. I will remember the works of the LORD: surely I will remember thy wonders of old.<br><a name="12">12</a>  I will meditate also of all thy work, and talk of thy doings.<br><a name="13">13</a>  Thy way, O God, [is] in the sanctuary: who [is so] great a God as [our] God?<br><a name="14">14</a>  Thou [art] the God that doest wonders: thou hast declared thy strength among the people.<br><a name="15">15</a>  Thou hast with [thine] arm redeemed thy people, the sons of Jacob and Joseph. Selah.<br><a name="16">16</a>  The waters saw thee, O God, the waters saw thee; they were afraid: the depths also were troubled.<br><a name="17">17</a>  The clouds poured out water: the skies sent out a sound: thine arrows also went abroad.<br><a name="18">18</a>  The voice of thy thunder [was] in the heaven: the lightnings lightened the world: the earth trembled and shook.<br><a name="19">19</a>  Thy way [is] in the sea, and thy path in the great waters, and thy footsteps are not known.<br><a name="20">20</a>  Thou leddest thy people like a flock by the hand of Moses and Aaron.<br><br>Go to <a href="psa78.htm#1">Psalm 78</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
