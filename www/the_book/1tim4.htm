1Timothy   4<br>1. Now the Spirit speaketh expressly, that in the latter times some shall depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits, and doctrines of devils;<br><a name="2">2</a>  Speaking lies in hypocrisy; having their conscience seared with a hot iron;<br><a name="3">3</a>  Forbidding to marry, [and commanding] to abstain from meats, which God hath created to be received with thanksgiving of them which believe and know the truth.<br><a name="4">4</a>  For every creature of God [is] good, and nothing to be refused, if it be received with thanksgiving:<br><a name="5">5</a>  For it is sanctified by the word of God and prayer.<br><a name="6">6</a>. If thou put the brethren in remembrance of these things, thou shalt be a good minister of Jesus Christ, nourished up in the words of faith and of good doctrine, whereunto thou hast attained.<br><a name="7">7</a>  But refuse profane and old wives' fables, and exercise thyself [rather] unto godliness.<br><a name="8">8</a>  For bodily exercise profiteth little: but godliness is profitable unto all things, having promise of the life that now is, and of that which is to come.<br><a name="9">9</a>  This [is] a faithful saying and worthy of all acceptation.<br><a name="10">10</a>  For therefore we both labour and suffer reproach, because we trust in the living God, who is the Saviour of all men, specially of those that believe.<br><a name="11">11</a>  These things command and teach.<br><a name="12">12</a>  Let no man despise thy youth; but be thou an example of the believers, in word, in conversation, in charity, in spirit, in faith, in purity.<br><a name="13">13</a>  Till I come, give attendance to reading, to exhortation, to doctrine.<br><a name="14">14</a>  Neglect not the gift that is in thee, which was given thee by prophecy, with the laying on of the hands of the presbytery.<br><a name="15">15</a>  Meditate upon these things; give thyself wholly to them; that thy profiting may appear to all.<br><a name="16">16</a>  Take heed unto thyself, and unto the doctrine; continue in them: for in doing this thou shalt both save thyself, and them that hear thee.<br><br>Go to <a href="1tim5.htm#1">I Timothy 5</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
