Mark   8<br>1. In those days the multitude being very great, and having nothing to eat, Jesus called his disciples [unto him], and saith unto them,<br><a name="2">2</a>  I have compassion on the multitude, because they have now been with me three days, and have nothing to eat:<br><a name="3">3</a>  And if I send them away fasting to their own houses, they will faint by the way: for divers of them came from far.<br><a name="4">4</a>  And his disciples answered him, From whence can a man satisfy these [men] with bread here in the wilderness?<br><a name="5">5</a>  And he asked them, How many loaves have ye? And they said, Seven.<br><a name="6">6</a>  And he commanded the people to sit down on the ground: and he took the seven loaves, and gave thanks, and brake, and gave to his disciples to set before [them]; and they did set [them] before the people.<br><a name="7">7</a>  And they had a few small fishes: and he blessed, and commanded to set them also before [them].<br><a name="8">8</a>  So they did eat, and were filled: and they took up of the broken [meat] that was left seven baskets.<br><a name="9">9</a>  And they that had eaten were about four thousand: and he sent them away.<br><a name="10">10</a>. And straightway he entered into a ship with his disciples, and came into the parts of Dalmanutha.<br><a name="11">11</a>  And the Pharisees came forth, and began to question with him, seeking of him a sign from heaven, tempting him.<br><a name="12">12</a>  And he sighed deeply in his spirit, and saith, Why doth this generation seek after a sign? verily I say unto you, There shall no sign be given unto this generation.<br><a name="13">13</a>  And he left them, and entering into the ship again departed to the other side.<br><a name="14">14</a>  Now [the disciples] had forgotten to take bread, neither had they in the ship with them more than one loaf.<br><a name="15">15</a>  And he charged them, saying, Take heed, beware of the leaven of the Pharisees, and [of] the leaven of Herod.<br><a name="16">16</a>  And they reasoned among themselves, saying, [It is] because we have no bread.<br><a name="17">17</a>  And when Jesus knew [it], he saith unto them, Why reason ye, because ye have no bread? perceive ye not yet, neither understand? have ye your heart yet hardened?<br><a name="18">18</a>  Having eyes, see ye not? and having ears, hear ye not? and do ye not remember?<br><a name="19">19</a>  When I brake the five loaves among five thousand, how many baskets full of fragments took ye up? They say unto him, Twelve.<br><a name="20">20</a>  And when the seven among four thousand, how many baskets full of fragments took ye up? And they said, Seven.<br><a name="21">21</a>  And he said unto them, How is it that ye do not understand?<br><a name="22">22</a>. And he cometh to Bethsaida; and they bring a blind man unto him, and besought him to touch him.<br><a name="23">23</a>  And he took the blind man by the hand, and led him out of the town; and when he had spit on his eyes, and put his hands upon him, he asked him if he saw ought.<br><a name="24">24</a>  And he looked up, and said, I see men as trees, walking.<br><a name="25">25</a>  After that he put [his] hands again upon his eyes, and made him look up: and he was restored, and saw every man clearly.<br><a name="26">26</a>  And he sent him away to his house, saying, Neither go into the town, nor tell [it] to any in the town.<br><a name="27">27</a>. And Jesus went out, and his disciples, into the towns of Caesarea Philippi: and by the way he asked his disciples, saying unto them, Whom do men say that I am?<br><a name="28">28</a>  And they answered, John the Baptist: but some [say], Elias; and others, One of the prophets.<br><a name="29">29</a>  And he saith unto them, But whom say ye that I am? And Peter answereth and saith unto him, Thou art the Christ.<br><a name="30">30</a>  And he charged them that they should tell no man of him.<br><a name="31">31</a>  And he began to teach them, that the Son of man must suffer many things, and be rejected of the elders, and [of] the chief priests, and scribes, and be killed, and after three days rise again.<br><a name="32">32</a>  And he spake that saying openly. And Peter took him, and began to rebuke him.<br><a name="33">33</a>  But when he had turned about and looked on his disciples, he rebuked Peter, saying, Get thee behind me, Satan: for thou savourest not the things that be of God, but the things that be of men.<br><a name="34">34</a>  And when he had called the people [unto him] with his disciples also, he said unto them, Whosoever will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me.<br><a name="35">35</a>  For whosoever will save his life shall lose it; but whosoever shall lose his life for my sake and the gospel's, the same shall save it.<br><a name="36">36</a>  For what shall it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul?<br><a name="37">37</a>  Or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul?<br><a name="38">38</a>  Whosoever therefore shall be ashamed of me and of my words in this adulterous and sinful generation; of him also shall the Son of man be ashamed, when he cometh in the glory of his Father with the holy angels.<br><br>Go to <a href="mar9.htm#1">Mark 9</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
