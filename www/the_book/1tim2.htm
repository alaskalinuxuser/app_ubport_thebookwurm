1Timothy   2<br>1. I exhort therefore, that, first of all, supplications, prayers, intercessions, [and] giving of thanks, be made for all men;<br><a name="2">2</a>  For kings, and [for] all that are in authority; that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godliness and honesty.<br><a name="3">3</a>  For this [is] good and acceptable in the sight of God our Saviour;<br><a name="4">4</a>  Who will have all men to be saved, and to come unto the knowledge of the truth.<br><a name="5">5</a>  For [there is] one God, and one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus;<br><a name="6">6</a>  Who gave himself a ransom for all, to be testified in due time.<br><a name="7">7</a>  Whereunto I am ordained a preacher, and an apostle, (I speak the truth in Christ, [and] lie not;) a teacher of the Gentiles in faith and verity.<br><a name="8">8</a>  I will therefore that men pray every where, lifting up holy hands, without wrath and doubting.<br><a name="9">9</a>. In like manner also, that women adorn themselves in modest apparel, with shamefacedness and sobriety; not with broided hair, or gold, or pearls, or costly array;<br><a name="10">10</a>  But (which becometh women professing godliness) with good works.<br><a name="11">11</a>  Let the woman learn in silence with all subjection.<br><a name="12">12</a>  But I suffer not a woman to teach, nor to usurp authority over the man, but to be in silence.<br><a name="13">13</a>  For Adam was first formed, then Eve.<br><a name="14">14</a>  And Adam was not deceived, but the woman being deceived was in the transgression.<br><a name="15">15</a>  Notwithstanding she shall be saved in childbearing, if they continue in faith and charity and holiness with sobriety.<br><br>Go to <a href="1tim3.htm#1">I Timothy 3</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
