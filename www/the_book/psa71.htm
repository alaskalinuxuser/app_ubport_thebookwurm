Psalms  71<br> 1. In thee, O LORD, do I put my trust: let me never be put to confusion.<br><a name="2">2</a>  Deliver me in thy righteousness, and cause me to escape: incline thine ear unto me, and save me.<br><a name="3">3</a>  Be thou my strong habitation, whereunto I may continually resort: thou hast given commandment to save me; for thou [art] my rock and my fortress.<br><a name="4">4</a>  Deliver me, O my God, out of the hand of the wicked, out of the hand of the unrighteous and cruel man.<br><a name="5">5</a>  For thou [art] my hope, O Lord GOD: [thou art] my trust from my youth.<br><a name="6">6</a>  By thee have I been holden up from the womb: thou art he that took me out of my mother's bowels: my praise [shall be] continually of thee.<br><a name="7">7</a>  I am as a wonder unto many; but thou [art] my strong refuge.<br><a name="8">8</a>  Let my mouth be filled [with] thy praise [and with] thy honour all the day.<br><a name="9">9</a>  Cast me not off in the time of old age; forsake me not when my strength faileth.<br><a name="10">10</a>  For mine enemies speak against me; and they that lay wait for my soul take counsel together,<br><a name="11">11</a>  Saying, God hath forsaken him: persecute and take him; for [there is] none to deliver [him].<br><a name="12">12</a>  O God, be not far from me: O my God, make haste for my help.<br><a name="13">13</a>  Let them be confounded [and] consumed that are adversaries to my soul; let them be covered [with] reproach and dishonour that seek my hurt.<br><a name="14">14</a>. But I will hope continually, and will yet praise thee more and more.<br><a name="15">15</a>  My mouth shall shew forth thy righteousness [and] thy salvation all the day; for I know not the numbers [thereof].<br><a name="16">16</a>  I will go in the strength of the Lord GOD: I will make mention of thy righteousness, [even] of thine only.<br><a name="17">17</a>  O God, thou hast taught me from my youth: and hitherto have I declared thy wondrous works.<br><a name="18">18</a>  Now also when I am old and grayheaded, O God, forsake me not; until I have shewed thy strength unto [this] generation, [and] thy power to every one [that] is to come.<br><a name="19">19</a>  Thy righteousness also, O God, [is] very high, who hast done great things: O God, who [is] like unto thee!<br><a name="20">20</a>  [Thou], which hast shewed me great and sore troubles, shalt quicken me again, and shalt bring me up again from the depths of the earth.<br><a name="21">21</a>  Thou shalt increase my greatness, and comfort me on every side.<br><a name="22">22</a>  I will also praise thee with the psaltery, [even] thy truth, O my God: unto thee will I sing with the harp, O thou Holy One of Israel.<br><a name="23">23</a>  My lips shall greatly rejoice when I sing unto thee; and my soul, which thou hast redeemed.<br><a name="24">24</a>  My tongue also shall talk of thy righteousness all the day long: for they are confounded, for they are brought unto shame, that seek my hurt.<br><br>Go to <a href="psa72.htm#1">Psalm 72</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
