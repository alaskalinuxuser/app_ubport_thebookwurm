<dt>troubled- (cp. word use in <a href="joh11.htm#33">11:33</a>; <a href="joh12.htm#27">12:27</a>; <a href="joh13.htm#21">13:21</a>; <a href="joh14.htm#27">14:27</a>)
<dd>Jesus had told them several potentially troubling things:<ul>
<li>He was going away. <a href="joh13.htm#33">13:33</a>
<li>He was about to die. <a href="joh12.htm#32">12:32,33</a>
<li>one of them was a traitor. <a href="joh13.htm#21">13:21</a>
<li>Peter would disown Him. <a href="joh13.htm#38">13:38</a>
<li>all of them would fall away from Him. <a href="mat26.htm#31">Mat 26:31</a></ul>
<dt>ye believe in God...- &quot;Be putting your trust in God. Also be putting your trust in me.&quot; [Wuest]
<dd>Their hearts would not be troubled, if they would commit everything to His keeping.
<dd>Jesus refers to God and Himself as equally trustworthy. cp. <a href="joh10.htm#27">10:27-30</a>; <a href="isa43.htm#1">Isa 43:1-3</a></dl><dt>
<b><i>14:2  In my Father's house are many mansions:<br>
if [it were] not [so], I would have told you.<br>
I go to prepare a place for you.<br>
14:3  And if I go and prepare a place for you,<br>
I will come again, and receive you unto myself;<br>
that where I am, [there] ye may be also.<br>

<dt>my Father's house- GK= oikia, house, habitation (ie., the heavens. cp. <a href="1kin8.htm#27">1Kin 8:27</a>).
<dt>many mansions - GK= mone, dwellings, abidings. cp. <a href="2cor5.htm#1">2Cor 5:1</a>
<dt>a place- GK= topos, a place marked off (as a city is delineated from wilderness). 
<dd>a place prepared - cp. <a href="heb11.htm#16">Heb 11:16</a>; <a href="rev21.htm#2">Rev 21:2</a>
<dt>The believer's true Home is heavenly, not earthly.-<ul>
<li>I would have told you, if it were not so.- Christ is uniquely qualified to confirm<br>
the reality of the heavenly city, the hope of OT believers. cp. <a href="heb11.htm#8">Heb 11:8-16</a>; <a href="joh3.htm#13">Joh 3:13</a></ul>
<dt>The believer's true Hope is Christ Himself.-<ul>
<li>I go to prepare a place for you.- cp. <a href="heb9.htm#28">Heb 9:28</a>
<li>I will come again and receive you unto myself...-<dd>(ie., at the Rapture of the church, <a href="1the4.htm#13">1The 4:13-18</a>).</dd><dt>
...that there ye may be also.- The believer's greatest joy is to be with Him.<dd><a href="joh17.htm#24">17:24</a>; <a href="2cor5.htm#8">2Cor 5:8</a>; <a href="php1.htm#23">Php 1:23</a>; <a href="1the4.htm#17">1The 4:17</a></dd><dt>
Note that our Lord has taken these tasks upon Himself. He has not delegated them to angels.<br>The Bridegroom personally prepares for and gathers His Bride to Himself.<dd>The language of <a href="joh14.htm#2" target="lwr_lt">v.2-4</a> is in keeping with the marriage customs of the Jews, at that time. The bridegroom, having secured the hand of his intended bride by paying a dowery, would return alone to his father's house. There he would prepare a place (often an addition to the father's house) for his bride. Only after everything was ready, would he return for her, and take her to his father's house, where they would be married, and where they would live together, in the place prepared.</dd></ul></dl><dt>

<dt>[I am] the truth.- It is not merely that He speaks the truth, but that...<dd><ul>

<dt>[I am] the life.- It is not merely that He can guide us in right living, but that...<dd><ul>
<li>He is the essence of Life. As the Father has Life in Himself, He has Life in Himself. <a href="joh1.htm#4">1:4</a>; <a href="joh5.htm#26">5:26</a>
<li>He is the source of Life, for those who trust in Him. <a href="joh1.htm#12">1:12,13</a>; <a href="joh11.htm#25">11:25,26</a>; <a href="joh14.htm#19" target="lwr_lt">14:19</a>; <a href="1joh5.htm#11">1Joh 5:11,12</a></ul>
<dt>no man comes to the Father, but by me.- Jesus does not say &quot;no man <i>goes</i> to the Father...&quot;
<dd>He calls us to Himself, that we might know the Father. cp. <a href="joh14.htm#7" target="lwr_lt">v.7</a>; <a href="isa55.htm#1">Isa 55:1-3</a>; <a href="joh7.htm#37">Joh 7:37</a>; <a href="joh17.htm#3">17:3</a></dl><dt>

or else believe me for the very works' sake.</i></b></dt><dl>
<dt>hast thou not 'known' me?- GK= ginosko, to come to understand, to know by experience (cp. <a href="joh14.htm#7" target="lwr_lt">v.7</a>).

He that believeth on me, the works that I do shall he do also;<br>

<dt>greater works- The disciples had already done miracles like those of Jesus. <a href="mat10.htm#5">Mat 10:5,8</a>
<dd>Which is greater? (a.) to heal the physically sick and raise the physically dead,<dd>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or, (b.) to lead spiritually dead men to eternal life?<br>
The later ministry of the apostles included many physical miracles, but these were not greater than those of Jesus. However, as they preached Christ crucified, risen and coming again, great multitudes were born again. cp. <a href="act2.htm#41">Acts 2:41</a>; <a href="act3.htm#6">3:6,12-19</a>
<dt>because I go unto my Father.- 
<dd>These 'greater works' are part of what Jesus referred to as &quot;the works that<i> I do</i>.&quot; <a href="joh14.htm#12" target="lwr_lt">v.12-14</a>
<dd>Christ continues the ministry which He came into the world to do. But ever since He departed out of the world, He does His work through men who &quot;believe in&quot; (trust in) Him (not in their own ability).<ul>
<li>He entrusts them with the proclamation of His word (<a href="2cor5.htm#18">2Cor 5:18-20</a>),<br>
which calls men to seek Him, who alone can supply their need. cp. <a href="joh1.htm#50">Joh 1:50,51</a>; <a href="joh5.htm#20">5:20,21</a>
<li>He empowers them by the Holy Spirit. cp. <a href="joh16.htm#7">16:7</a>; <a href="act1.htm#8">Acts 1:8</a>; <a href="act2.htm#32">2:32,33</a></ul></dl><dt><a name="13"></a>

that will I do, that the Father may be glorified in the Son.<br>
14:14  If ye shall ask any thing in my name, I will do [it].</i></b></dt><dl>
<dt>to 'ask in my name'- Means more than just adding His name at the end of my prayer.<dd>'The name of Jesus' is not a magic formula to secure whatever I want.<dd>Prayer 'in His name' conforms my heart to His purposes...<ul>
<li>To ask for things which the blood of Christ has secured for us. <a href="heb10.htm#19">Heb 10:19</a><dd>(This privilege belongs only to believers.)</dd>
<li>To ask with confidence in His authority, and ability. <a href="joh14.htm#12" target="lwr_lt">v.12</a>; <a href="mat28.htm#18">Mat 28:18-20</a>
<li>To ask according to His will (<a href="1joh5.htm#14">1Joh 5:14</a>). This implies that --<br>
- - we know His will. cp. <a href="joh7.htm#17">Joh 7:17</a><br>
- - we desire His will. cp. <a href="jam4.htm#3">James 4:3</a><br></ul>
<dt>ask... that the Father may be glorified in the Son... <i>I will do it</i>- cp. <a href="joh14.htm#12" target="lwr_lt">v.12</a>
<dd>It is proper to pray to God the Father (<a href="joh16.htm#23">16:23,24,26</a>) or to God the Son (<a href="joh10.htm#30">10:30</a>; <a href="act7.htm#59">Acts 7:59</a>).<dd>Our asking must agree with the heart of Christ, who does only what glorifies God. cp. <a href="1cor10.htm#31">1Cor 10:31</a>; <a href="col3.htm#17">Col 3:17</a></dl><dt>

<dt>another {of the same sort} Comforter- GK= parakletos, one who comes alongside, a consoler, a counselor.
<dd>Up until this time, Jesus was their comforter (<a href="joh14.htm#1" target="lwr_lt">v.1</a>). But He was about to go away.<br>In heaven, Christ is our 'advocate' {GK= parakletos} with the Father. <a href="1joh2.htm#1">1Joh 2:1</a>; cp. <a href="rom8.htm#34">Rom 8:34</a>; <a href="heb7.htm#25">Heb 7:25</a><br>Like Him, The Holy Spirit helps us in our infirmity.

<li>...shall be {future tense} in you.- since Pentecost, the Holy Spirit indwells all believers. <dd>cp. <a href="act2.htm#1">Acts 2:1-3</a>; <a href="act19.htm#2">19:2</a>; <a href="rom8.htm#9">Rom 8:9</a>; <a href="1cor12.htm#13">1Cor 12:13</a><dt>In John's Gospel, Jesus declared Himself as the fulfillment of the feasts of Tabernacles &amp; Passover. These were two of the three feasts at which attendance was required of all Jewish men. The significance of the third feast, would not be fulfilled until the Holy Spirit was given at Pentecost (the Feast of Weeks, Acts 2:1-3).</ul>

<dd><i>spiritually</i>, by the Holy Spirit (<a href="rom8.htm#9">Rom 8:9</a>).

<li>give them life- &quot;because I live, ye shall live also.&quot; <a href="joh14.htm#19" target="lwr_lt">v.19</a>; <a href="rom8.htm#2">Rom 8:2,9</a>; <a href="1cor15.htm#20">1Cor 15:20-22,45</a>; <a href="1pet3.htm#18">1Pet 3:18</a>

<dt>I in my Father... ye in me... I in you...-<ul>
<li>ye in me...- In Christ, believers have salvation.<dd>
We are 'baptised' into Him (ie., identified with Him)...<ul>
<li>as Noah, in the Ark, passed through judgment. cp. <a href="1pet3.htm#20">1Pet 3:20,21</a><br>
<li>as members in His body, joined to Him. <a href="1cor12.htm#12">1Cor 12:12,13</a><br>
<li>as branches in the Vine, dependent upon Him. <a href="joh15.htm#1">15:1-11</a></ul></dd>
