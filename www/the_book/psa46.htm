God [is] our refuge and strength, a very present help in trouble.<br><a name="2">2</a>  Therefore will not we fear, though the earth be removed, and though the mountains be carried into the midst of the sea;<br><a name="3">3</a>  [Though] the waters thereof roar [and] be troubled, [though] the mountains shake with the swelling thereof. Selah.<br><a name="4">4</a>  [There is] a river, the streams whereof shall make glad the city of God, the holy [place] of the tabernacles of the most High.<br><a name="5">5</a>  God [is] in the midst of her; she shall not be moved: God shall help her, [and that] right early.<br><a name="6">6</a>. The heathen raged, the kingdoms were moved: he uttered his voice, the earth melted.<br><a name="7">7</a>  The LORD of hosts [is] with us; the God of Jacob [is] our refuge. Selah.<br><a name="8">8</a>  Come, behold the works of the LORD, what desolations he hath made in the earth.<br><a name="9">9</a>  He maketh wars to cease unto the end of the earth; he breaketh the bow, and cutteth the spear in sunder; he burneth the chariot in the fire.<br><a name="10">10</a>  Be still, and know that I [am] God: I will be exalted among the heathen, I will be exalted in the earth.<br><a name="11">11</a>  The LORD of hosts [is] with us; the God of Jacob [is] our refuge.
