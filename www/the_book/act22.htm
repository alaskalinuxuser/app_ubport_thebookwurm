Acts  22<br>1. Men, brethren, and fathers, hear ye my defence [which I make] now unto you.<br><a name="2">2</a>  (And when they heard that he spake in the Hebrew tongue to them, they kept the more silence: and he saith,)<br><a name="3">3</a>. I am verily a man [which am] a Jew, born in Tarsus, [a city] in Cilicia, yet brought up in this city at the feet of Gamaliel, [and] taught according to the perfect manner of the law of the fathers, and was zealous toward God, as ye all are this day.<br><a name="4">4</a>  And I persecuted this way unto the death, binding and delivering into prisons both men and women.<br><a name="5">5</a>  As also the high priest doth bear me witness, and all the estate of the elders: from whom also I received letters unto the brethren, and went to Damascus, to bring them which were there bound unto Jerusalem, for to be punished.<br><a name="6">6</a>  And it came to pass, that, as I made my journey, and was come nigh unto Damascus about noon, suddenly there shone from heaven a great light round about me.<br><a name="7">7</a>  And I fell unto the ground, and heard a voice saying unto me, Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me?<br><a name="8">8</a>  And I answered, Who art thou, Lord? And he said unto me, I am Jesus of Nazareth, whom thou persecutest.<br><a name="9">9</a>  And they that were with me saw indeed the light, and were afraid; but they heard not the voice of him that spake to me.<br><a name="10">10</a>  And I said, What shall I do, Lord? And the Lord said unto me, Arise, and go into Damascus; and there it shall be told thee of all things which are appointed for thee to do.<br><a name="11">11</a>  And when I could not see for the glory of that light, being led by the hand of them that were with me, I came into Damascus.<br><a name="12">12</a>  And one Ananias, a devout man according to the law, having a good report of all the Jews which dwelt [there],<br><a name="13">13</a>  Came unto me, and stood, and said unto me, Brother Saul, receive thy sight. And the same hour I looked up upon him.<br><a name="14">14</a>  And he said, The God of our fathers hath chosen thee, that thou shouldest know his will, and see that Just One, and shouldest hear the voice of his mouth.<br><a name="15">15</a>  For thou shalt be his witness unto all men of what thou hast seen and heard.<br><a name="16">16</a>  And now why tarriest thou? arise, and be baptized, and wash away thy sins, calling on the name of the Lord.<br><a name="17">17</a>  And it came to pass, that, when I was come again to Jerusalem, even while I prayed in the temple, I was in a trance;<br><a name="18">18</a>  And saw him saying unto me, Make haste, and get thee quickly out of Jerusalem: for they will not receive thy testimony concerning me.<br><a name="19">19</a>  And I said, Lord, they know that I imprisoned and beat in every synagogue them that believed on thee:<br><a name="20">20</a>  And when the blood of thy martyr Stephen was shed, I also was standing by, and consenting unto his death, and kept the raiment of them that slew him.<br><a name="21">21</a>  And he said unto me, Depart: for I will send thee far hence unto the Gentiles.<br><a name="22">22</a>. And they gave him audience unto this word, and [then] lifted up their voices, and said, Away with such a [fellow] from the earth: for it is not fit that he should live.<br><a name="23">23</a>  And as they cried out, and cast off [their] clothes, and threw dust into the air,<br><a name="24">24</a>  The chief captain commanded him to be brought into the castle, and bade that he should be examined by scourging; that he might know wherefore they cried so against him.<br><a name="25">25</a>  And as they bound him with thongs, Paul said unto the centurion that stood by, Is it lawful for you to scourge a man that is a Roman, and uncondemned?<br><a name="26">26</a>  When the centurion heard [that], he went and told the chief captain, saying, Take heed what thou doest: for this man is a Roman.<br><a name="27">27</a>  Then the chief captain came, and said unto him, Tell me, art thou a Roman? He said, Yea.<br><a name="28">28</a>  And the chief captain answered, With a great sum obtained I this freedom. And Paul said, But I was [free] born.<br><a name="29">29</a>  Then straightway they departed from him which should have examined him: and the chief captain also was afraid, after he knew that he was a Roman, and because he had bound him.<br><a name="30">30</a>  On the morrow, because he would have known the certainty wherefore he was accused of the Jews, he loosed him from [his] bands, and commanded the chief priests and all their council to appear, and brought Paul down, and set him before them.<br><br>Go to <a href="act23.htm#1">Acts 23</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
