Psalms  79<br>1. A Psalm of Asaph. O God, the heathen are come into thine inheritance; thy holy temple have they defiled; they have laid Jerusalem on heaps.<br><a name="2">2</a>  The dead bodies of thy servants have they given [to be] meat unto the fowls of the heaven, the flesh of thy saints unto the beasts of the earth.<br><a name="3">3</a>  Their blood have they shed like water round about Jerusalem; and [there was] none to bury [them].<br><a name="4">4</a>  We are become a reproach to our neighbours, a scorn and derision to them that are round about us.<br><a name="5">5</a>  How long, LORD? wilt thou be angry for ever? shall thy jealousy burn like fire?<br><a name="6">6</a>. Pour out thy wrath upon the heathen that have not known thee, and upon the kingdoms that have not called upon thy name.<br><a name="7">7</a>  For they have devoured Jacob, and laid waste his dwelling place.<br><a name="8">8</a>  O remember not against us former iniquities: let thy tender mercies speedily prevent us: for we are brought very low.<br><a name="9">9</a>  Help us, O God of our salvation, for the glory of thy name: and deliver us, and purge away our sins, for thy name's sake.<br><a name="10">10</a>  Wherefore should the heathen say, Where [is] their God? let him be known among the heathen in our sight [by] the revenging of the blood of thy servants [which is] shed.<br><a name="11">11</a>  Let the sighing of the prisoner come before thee; according to the greatness of thy power preserve thou those that are appointed to die;<br><a name="12">12</a>  And render unto our neighbours sevenfold into their bosom their reproach, wherewith they have reproached thee, O Lord.<br><a name="13">13</a>  So we thy people and sheep of thy pasture will give thee thanks for ever: we will shew forth thy praise to all generations.<br><br>Go to <a href="psa80.htm#1">Psalm 80</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
