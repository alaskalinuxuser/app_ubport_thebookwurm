<dt><b><i>8:1 And the LORD spake unto Moses, Go unto Pharaoh, and say unto him,<br>Thus saith the LORD, Let my people go, that they may serve me.<br>
8:2 And if thou refuse to let [them] go, behold, I will smite all thy borders with frogs:<br>
8:3 And the river shall bring forth frogs abundantly, which shall go up and come into thine house,<br>and into thy bedchamber, and upon thy bed, and into the house of thy servants,<br>and upon thy people, and into thine ovens, and into thy kneadingtroughs:<br>
8:4 And the frogs shall come up both on thee, and upon thy people, and upon all thy servants.<br>
8:5 And the LORD spake unto Moses, Say unto Aaron,<br>Stretch forth thine hand with thy rod over the streams, over the rivers, and over the ponds,<br>and cause frogs to come up upon the land of Egypt.<br>
8:6 And Aaron stretched out his hand over the waters of Egypt;<br>and the frogs came up, and covered the land of Egypt.<br>
8:7 And the magicians did so with their enchantments, and brought up frogs upon the land of Egypt.<br>
8:8 Then Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron, and said,<br>Intreat the LORD, that he may take away the frogs from me, and from my people;<br>and I will let the people go, that they may do sacrifice unto the LORD.<br>
8:9 And Moses said unto Pharaoh, Glory over me </b></i>{ie., Excercise your discretion in this matter}<i><b>:<br>when shall I intreat for thee, and for thy servants, and for thy people,<br>to destroy the frogs from thee and thy houses, [that] they may remain in the river only?<br>
8:10 And he said, To morrow.<br>And he said, [Be it] according to thy word:<br>that thou mayest know that [there is] none like unto the LORD our God.<br>
8:11 And the frogs shall depart from thee,<br>and from thy houses, and from thy servants, and from thy people;<br>they shall remain in the river only.<br>
8:12 And Moses and Aaron went out from Pharaoh:<br>and Moses cried unto the LORD because of the frogs which he had brought against Pharaoh.<br>
8:13 And the LORD did according to the word of Moses;<br>and the frogs died out of the houses, out of the villages, and out of the fields.<br>
8:14 And they gathered them together upon heaps: and the land stank.<br>
8:15 But when Pharaoh saw that there was respite </b></i>{ie., relief}<i><b>,<br>he hardened </b></i>{HB=kabed, honored}<i><b> his heart,<br>and hearkened not unto them; as the LORD had said.</i></b></dt><dl>
<dt>Plague #2 - Frogs<ul>
<li><i>False gods judged</i> - Heqet (or Heka), the frog headed goddess of reproduction,<dd>and Hapi (Apis), which was &quot;depicted as holding a froq, out of whose mouth flowed a stream of nourishment.&quot; [McGee]</dd>
<li><i>Magicians' response</i> - They imitated the production of frogs, but they could not remove them.<dd>The 'sacred frogs' became a source of evil, rather than of good.</dd><dd>Yet, they remained illegal to kill.</dd>
<li><i>Pharaoh's response</i> -<ul><li>He asked Moses to entreat the Lord to remove the frogs.<dd>The predetermined time for the destruction of the frogs, provided evidence of the Lord's controlling power.</dd><dd>This had been no accident of nature.</dd>
<li>He hardened his heart, and hearkened not unto them.</ul></ul></dl><dt>
<b><i>8:16 And the LORD said unto Moses, Say unto Aaron, Stretch out thy rod,<br>and smite the dust of the land, that it may become lice throughout all the land of Egypt.<br>
8:17 And they did so; for Aaron stretched out his hand with his rod,<br>and smote the dust of the earth, and it became lice in man, and in beast;<br>all the dust of the land became lice throughout all the land of Egypt.<br>
8:18 And the magicians did so with their enchantments to bring forth lice, but they could not:<br>so there were lice upon man, and upon beast.<br>
8:19 Then the magicians said unto Pharaoh, This [is] the finger of God:<br>and Pharaoh's heart was hardened </b></i>{HB=chazaq, strengthened}<i><b>,<br>and he hearkened not unto them; as the LORD had said.</i></b></dt><dl>
<dt>Plague #3 - Lice (or gnats), the root of the HB word means 'to cover, nip, pinch.' [McGee]<dd>Perhaps these insects were scavengers of the dead frogs.<ul>
<li><i>False gods judged</i> - Geb, Seb or Set, the god of the earth.<dd>The dust of the earth god became loathsome.</dd>
<li><i>Magicians' response</i> - They could not imitate this infestation.<dd>Their report to Pharaoh: &quot;This is the finger of God.&quot;</dd><dd>They were yet to see God's hand (<a href="ex7.htm#5">Ex 7:5</a>) and arm (<a href="ex6.htm#6">Ex 6:6</a>; <a href="ex10.htm#7">10:7</a>).</dd>
<li><i>Pharaoh's response</i> - his heart was hardened, he hearkened not to what the LORD had said.</ul></dl><dt>
<b><i>8:20 And the LORD said unto Moses, Rise up early in the morning,<br>and stand before Pharaoh; lo, he cometh forth to the water;<br>and say unto him, Thus saith the LORD, Let my people go, that they may serve me.<br>
8:21 Else, if thou wilt not let my people go, behold, I will send swarms [of flies] upon thee,<br>and upon thy servants, and upon thy people, and into thy houses:<br>and the houses of the Egyptians shall be full of swarms [of flies],<br>and also the ground whereon they [are].<br>
8:22 And I will sever in that day the land of Goshen, in which my people dwell, 
</b></i><dd>Goshen- a region in northern Egypt east of the Nile, where Israel dwelt from the time of Joseph (<a href="gen47.htm#5">Gen 47:5,6</a>).<i><b>
<dt>that no swarms [of flies] shall be there;<br>to the end thou mayest know that I [am] the LORD in the midst of the earth.<br>
8:23 And I will put a division between my people and thy people: to morrow shall this sign be.<br>
8:24 And the LORD did so; and there came a grievous swarm [of flies] into the house of Pharaoh,<br>and [into] his servants' houses, and into all the land of Egypt:<br>the land was corrupted by reason of the swarm [of flies].<br>
8:25 And Pharaoh called for Moses and for Aaron, and said,<br>Go ye, sacrifice to your God in the land.<br>
8:26 And Moses said, It is not meet so to do;<br>for we shall sacrifice the abomination of the Egyptians to the LORD our God:<br>lo, shall we sacrifice the abomination of the Egyptians before their eyes, and will they not stone us?<br>
8:27 We will go three days' journey into the wilderness, and sacrifice to the LORD our God,<br>as he shall command us.<br>
8:28 And Pharaoh said, I will let you go,<br>that ye may sacrifice to the LORD your God in the wilderness;<br>only ye shall not go very far away: intreat for me.<br>
8:29 And Moses said, Behold, I go out from thee,<br>and I will intreat the LORD that the swarms [of flies] may depart from Pharaoh,<br>from his servants, and from his people, to morrow:<br>but let not Pharaoh deal deceitfully any more in not letting the people go to sacrifice to the LORD.<br>
8:30 And Moses went out from Pharaoh, and intreated the LORD.<br>
8:31 And the LORD did according to the word of Moses;<br>and he removed the swarms [of flies] from Pharaoh, from his servants, and from his people;<br>there remained not one.<br>
8:32 And Pharaoh hardened </b></i>{HB=kabed, honored}<i><b> his heart at this time also,<br>neither would he let the people go.</i></b></dt><dl>
<dt>Plague #4 - Flies or beetles. <ul>
<li><i>False gods judged</i> - Khepara, the beetle god -<br>
- - depicted by the scarabs, found in the tombs of Egypt.<br>
- - signified eternal life.<br>
By means of this false symbol of life, the land was 'corrupted'<dd>(a word associated with death and destruction).<dt>
But God put a 'division' (HB= peduth, redemption, cp. word use in <a href="psa111.htm#9">Psa 111:9</a>; <a href="psa130.htm#7">130:7</a>)...<dd>ie., God 'appointed a redemption' that separated His people from this corruption.<dt>
<li><i>Magicians' response</i> - (silence)
<li><i>Pharaoh's response</i> - <ol type="A"><li>he offered two compromises:<ol type="a">
<li>Go, sacrifice to your God, <i>in the land</i>.<br>
Moses rejected this immediately, on the basis of God's Word (<a href="ex3.htm#18">Ex 3:18</a>; <a href="ex5.htm#3">5:3</a>).<br>
God had said &quot;I am come down to deliver them&quot; (<a href="ex3.htm#8">3:8</a>). Nothing less could either satisfy them or glorify Him. [CHM]<ul>
<li>They must &quot;sacrifice the abomination of the Egyptians&quot; (cp. <a href="gen46.htm#33">Gen 46:33,34</a>).<dd>The slain lamb would be an offense to the citizens of Egypt. cp. <a href="1pet2.htm#7">1Pet 2:7,8</a></dd>
<li>&quot;They must go 'three days' journey.' They would be separated from the land of death and darkness,<dd>by the space of death and resurrection (<a href="1cor15.htm#1">1Cor 15:1-4</a>).&quot; [CHM]</dd></ul>
<li>Go... sacrifice... in the wilderness, only <i>you shall not go far away</i>.<dd>Pharaoh would suggest a total of four compromises, before Israel would leave Egypt.</dd><dd>See the <a href="ex10an.htm#8" target="lwr_lt">Notes at Ex 10:8-11</a> for a discussion of these compromises, and their significance.</dd></ol>
<li>he hardened his heart, and would not let the people go (he dealt deceitfully, <a href="ex8.htm#29" target="lwr_lt">v.29</a>).</ol></ul>
