Genesis  39<br>1. And Joseph was brought down to Egypt; and Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh, captain of the guard, an Egyptian, bought him of the hands of the Ishmeelites, which had brought him down thither.<br><a name="2">2</a>  And the LORD was with Joseph, and he was a prosperous man; and he was in the house of his master the Egyptian.<br><a name="3">3</a>  And his master saw that the LORD [was] with him, and that the LORD made all that he did to prosper in his hand.<br><a name="4">4</a>  And Joseph found grace in his sight, and he served him: and he made him overseer over his house, and all [that] he had he put into his hand.<br><a name="5">5</a>  And it came to pass from the time [that] he had made him overseer in his house, and over all that he had, that the LORD blessed the Egyptian's house for Joseph's sake; and the blessing of the LORD was upon all that he had in the house, and in the field.<br><a name="6">6</a>  And he left all that he had in Joseph's hand; and he knew not ought he had, save the bread which he did eat. And Joseph was [a] goodly [person], and well favoured.<br><a name="7">7</a>. And it came to pass after these things, that his master's wife cast her eyes upon Joseph; and she said, Lie with me.<br><a name="8">8</a>  But he refused, and said unto his master's wife, Behold, my master wotteth not what [is] with me in the house, and he hath committed all that he hath to my hand;<br><a name="9">9</a>  [There is] none greater in this house than I; neither hath he kept back any thing from me but thee, because thou [art] his wife: how then can I do this great wickedness, and sin against God?<br><a name="10">10</a>  And it came to pass, as she spake to Joseph day by day, that he hearkened not unto her, to lie by her, [or] to be with her.<br><a name="11">11</a>  And it came to pass about this time, that [Joseph] went into the house to do his business; and [there was] none of the men of the house there within.<br><a name="12">12</a>  And she caught him by his garment, saying, Lie with me: and he left his garment in her hand, and fled, and got him out.<br><a name="13">13</a>. And it came to pass, when she saw that he had left his garment in her hand, and was fled forth,<br><a name="14">14</a>  That she called unto the men of her house, and spake unto them, saying, See, he hath brought in an Hebrew unto us to mock us; he came in unto me to lie with me, and I cried with a loud voice:<br><a name="15">15</a>  And it came to pass, when he heard that I lifted up my voice and cried, that he left his garment with me, and fled, and got him out.<br><a name="16">16</a>  And she laid up his garment by her, until his lord came home.<br><a name="17">17</a>  And she spake unto him according to these words, saying, The Hebrew servant, which thou hast brought unto us, came in unto me to mock me:<br><a name="18">18</a>  And it came to pass, as I lifted up my voice and cried, that he left his garment with me, and fled out.<br><a name="19">19</a>. And it came to pass, when his master heard the words of his wife, which she spake unto him, saying, After this manner did thy servant to me; that his wrath was kindled.<br><a name="20">20</a>  And Joseph's master took him, and put him into the prison, a place where the king's prisoners [were] bound: and he was there in the prison.<br><a name="21">21</a>  But the LORD was with Joseph, and shewed him mercy, and gave him favour in the sight of the keeper of the prison.<br><a name="22">22</a>  And the keeper of the prison committed to Joseph's hand all the prisoners that [were] in the prison; and whatsoever they did there, he was the doer [of it].<br><a name="23">23</a>  The keeper of the prison looked not to any thing [that was] under his hand; because the LORD was with him, and [that] which he did, the LORD made [it] to prosper.<br><br>Go to <a href="gen40.htm#1">Genesis 40</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
