Psalms 146<br> 1. Praise ye the LORD. Praise the LORD, O my soul.<br><a name="2">2</a>  While I live will I praise the LORD: I will sing praises unto my God while I have any being.<br><a name="3">3</a>  Put not your trust in princes, [nor] in the son of man, in whom [there is] no help.<br><a name="4">4</a>  His breath goeth forth, he returneth to his earth; in that very day his thoughts perish.<br><a name="5">5</a>. Happy [is he] that [hath] the God of Jacob for his help, whose hope [is] in the LORD his God:<br><a name="6">6</a>  Which made heaven, and earth, the sea, and all that therein [is]: which keepeth truth for ever:<br><a name="7">7</a>  Which executeth judgment for the oppressed: which giveth food to the hungry. The LORD looseth the prisoners:<br><a name="8">8</a>  The LORD openeth [the eyes of] the blind: the LORD raiseth them that are bowed down: the LORD loveth the righteous:<br><a name="9">9</a>  The LORD preserveth the strangers; he relieveth the fatherless and widow: but the way of the wicked he turneth upside down.<br><a name="10">10</a>  The LORD shall reign for ever, [even] thy God, O Zion, unto all generations.
