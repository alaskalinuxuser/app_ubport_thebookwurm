<dt><b><i>43:1 And the famine [was] sore in the land.<br>
43:2 And it came to pass, when they had eaten up the corn which they had brought out of Egypt,<br>their father said unto them, Go again, buy us a little food.<br>
43:3 And Judah spake unto him, saying, The man did solemnly protest unto us, saying,<br>Ye shall not see my face, except your brother [be] with you.<br>
43:4 If thou wilt send our brother with us, we will go down and buy thee food:<br>
43:5 But if thou wilt not send [him], we will not go down: for the man said unto us,<br>Ye shall not see my face, except your brother [be] with you.<br>
43:6 And Israel said,<br>Wherefore dealt ye [so] ill with me, [as] to tell the man whether ye had yet a brother?<br>
43:7 And they said, The man asked us straitly of our state, and of our kindred, saying,<br>[Is] your father yet alive? have ye [another] brother?<br>and we told him according to the tenor of these words:<br>could we certainly know that he would say, Bring your brother down?<br>
43:8 And Judah said unto Israel his father, Send the lad with me, and we will arise and go;<br>that we may live, and not die, both we, and thou, [and] also our little ones.<br>
43:9 I will be surety for him; of my hand shalt thou require him:<br>if I bring him not unto thee, and set him before thee, then let me bear the blame for ever:<br>
43:10 For except we had lingered, surely now we had returned this second time.<br>
43:11 And their father Israel said unto them, If [it must be] so now, do this;<br>take of the best fruits in the land in your vessels, and carry down the man a present,<br>a little balm, and a little honey, spices, and myrrh, nuts, and almonds:<br>
43:12 And take double money in your hand;<br>and the money that was brought again in the mouth of your sacks, carry [it] again in your hand;<br>peradventure it [was] an oversight:<br>
43:13 Take also your brother, and arise, go again unto the man:<br>
43:14 And God Almighty give you mercy before the man,<br>that he may send away your other brother, and Benjamin.<br>If I be bereaved [of my children], I am bereaved.</i></b></dt><dl>
<dt>a little balm... a little honey, spices, and myrrh, nuts, and almonds-
<dd>During the famine, they had these things (in limited quantity), but they lacked grain for bread, the staff of life.
<dt>Judah became a 'surety' for Benjamin.
<dd>He alone would be fully accountable to pay any price required for loss. cp. <a href="phm1.htm#18">Phm 1:18,19</a>; <a href="heb7.htm#22">Heb 7:22</a>
</dl><dt>
<b><i>43:15 And the men took that present, and they took double money in their hand, and Benjamin;<br>and rose up, and went down to Egypt, and stood before Joseph.<br>
43:16 And when Joseph saw Benjamin with them, he said to the ruler of his house,<br>Bring [these] men home, and slay, and make ready;<br>for [these] men shall dine with me at noon.<br>
43:17 And the man did as Joseph bade; and the man brought the men into Joseph's house.<br>
43:18 And the men were afraid, because they were brought into Joseph's house; and they said,<br>Because of the money that was returned in our sacks at the first time are we brought in;<br>that he may seek occasion against us, and fall upon us, and take us for bondmen, and our asses.<br>
43:19 And they came near to the steward of Joseph's house,<br>and they communed with him at the door of the house,<br>
43:20 And said, O sir, we came indeed down at the first time to buy food:<br>
43:21 And it came to pass, when we came to the inn, that we opened our sacks,<br>and, behold, [every] man's money [was] in the mouth of his sack, our money in full weight:<br>and we have brought it again in our hand.<br>
43:22 And other money have we brought down in our hands to buy food:<br>we cannot tell who put our money in our sacks.<br>
43:23 And he said, Peace [be] to you, fear not:<br>your God, and the God of your father, hath given you treasure in your sacks: I had your money.<br>And he brought Simeon out unto them.<br>
43:24 And the man brought the men into Joseph's house,<br>and gave [them] water, and they washed their feet; and he gave their asses provender.<br>
43:25 And they made ready the present against Joseph came at noon:<br>for they heard that they should eat bread there.<br>
43:26 And when Joseph came home,<br>they brought him the present which [was] in their hand into the house,<br>and bowed themselves to him to the earth. </b></i>{cp. <a href="gen37.htm#8">37:8,20,21</a>}<i><b><br>
43:27 And he asked them of [their] welfare, and said,<br>[Is] your father well, the old man of whom ye spake? [Is] he yet alive?<br>
43:28 And they answered, Thy servant our father [is] in good health, he [is] yet alive.<br>And they bowed down their heads, and made obeisance.<br>
43:29 And he lifted up his eyes, and saw his brother Benjamin, his mother's son, and said,<br>[Is] this your younger brother, of whom ye spake unto me?<br>And he said, God be gracious unto thee, my son.<br>
43:30 And Joseph made haste; for his bowels did yearn upon his brother: 
<dd></b></i>{ie., he was overcome with emotion; his heart went out to him:}<i><b><dt>and he sought [where] to weep; and he entered into [his] chamber, and wept there.<br>
43:31 And he washed his face, and went out, and refrained himself, and said, Set on bread.<br>
43:32 And they set on for him by himself, and for them by themselves,<br>and for the Egyptians, which did eat with him, by themselves:<br>because the Egyptians might not eat bread with the Hebrews;<br>for that [is] an abomination unto the Egyptians.<br>
43:33 And they sat before him, the firstborn according to his birthright,<br>and the youngest according to his youth: and the men marvelled one at another.<br>
43:34 And he took [and sent] messes </b></i>{ie., servings}<i><b> unto them from before him:<br>but Benjamin's mess was five times so much as any of theirs.<br>And they drank, and were merry with him.</i></b></dt><dl>
