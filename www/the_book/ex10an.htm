<dt><b><i>10:1 And the LORD said unto Moses, Go in unto Pharaoh:<br>for I have hardened </b></i>{HB=kabad, honored}<i><b> his heart, and the heart of his servants,<br>that I might shew these my signs before him:<br>
10:2 And that thou mayest tell in the ears of thy son, and of thy son's son,<br>what things I have wrought in Egypt, and my signs which I have done among them;<br>that ye may know how that I [am] the LORD.</b></i>
<dd>The signs, which revealed the identity of the LORD to Pharaoh and the Egyptians (<a href="ex9.htm#14">9:14</a>),<br>were also meant to reveal Him to Israel. cp. <a href="ex13.htm#8">Ex 13:8,9,14</a>; <a href="deu4.htm#9">Deu 4:9</a>; <a href="deu6.htm#20">6:20-23</a><i><b><dt>
10:3 And Moses and Aaron came in unto Pharaoh, and said unto him,<br>Thus saith the LORD God of the Hebrews,<br>How long wilt thou refuse to humble thyself before me?<br>let my people go, that they may serve me.<br>
10:4 Else, if thou refuse to let my people go,<br>behold, to morrow will I bring the locusts into thy coast </b></i>{ie., borders}<i><b>:<br>
10:5 And they shall cover the face of the earth, that one cannot be able to see the earth:<br>and they shall eat the residue of that which is escaped, which remaineth unto you from the hail,<br>and shall eat every tree which groweth for you out of the field:<br>
10:6 And they shall fill thy houses, and the houses of all thy servants, and the houses of all the Egyptians;<br>which neither thy fathers, nor thy fathers' fathers have seen,<br>since the day that they were upon the earth unto this day.<br>And he turned himself, and went out from Pharaoh.<br>
10:7 And Pharaoh's servants said unto him, How long shall this man be a snare unto us?<br>let the men go, that they may serve the LORD their God:<br>knowest thou not yet that Egypt is destroyed?</i></b></dt><dl>
<dt>Plague #8 - Locusts consume crops -
<dd>all of the crops that had survived the hail storm would be destroyed. <a href="ex10.htm#14" target="lwr_lt">v.14,15</a>; cp. <a href="ex9.htm#24">9:24-25,31-32</a>
<dt><ul><li><i>False gods judged</i> - Serapsis, the protector from locust plagues.<dd>
Osiris, god of crops. Numerous &quot;insect gods.&quot;<dt>
<li><i>Magicians' response</i> - They counseled Pharaoh to let Israel go. They understood that,<dd>due to the previous plagues, Egypt was already destroyed (HB=abad, to perish).</dd><dd>They could ill afford further losses.</dd>
<li><i>Pharaoh's response</i> -<ol type="A">
<li>Prior to the plague: <ul><li>he agreed to let them go, on condition of another compromise (<a href="ex10.htm#8" target="lwr_lt">v.8-11</a>).
<li>he kicked Moses &amp; Aaron out, when they rejected this compromise.</ul>
<li>Following the damage of the plague:<ol type="a">
<li>he called for Moses &amp; Aaron 'in haste' (ie., with anxious urgency).
<li>he confessed that he had sinned (<a href="ex10.htm#16" target="lwr_lt">v.16</a>).
<li>he asked Moses to forgive him, and to entreat the Lord to remove the locusts (<a href="ex10.htm#17" target="lwr_lt">v.17-19</a>).
<li>his heart was hardened... he would not let the people go (<a href="ex10.htm#20" target="lwr_lt">v.20</a>).</ol></ol></ul></dl><dt>

<b><i>10:8 And Moses and Aaron were brought again unto Pharaoh:<br>and he said unto them, Go, serve the LORD your God: [but] who [are] they that shall go?<br>
10:9 And Moses said, We will go with our young and with our old,<br>with our sons and with our daughters, with our flocks and with our herds will we go;<br>for we [must hold] a feast unto the LORD.<br>
10:10 And he said unto them, Let the LORD be so with you, as I will let you go, and your little ones:<br>look [to it]; for evil [is] before you.<br>
10:11 Not so: go now ye [that are] men, and serve the LORD; for that ye did desire.<br>And they were driven out from Pharaoh's presence.</b></i></dt><dl>
<dt>Pharaoh proposed four compromises (in the course of the ten plagues).-
<dd>The believer today faces similar compromises with the world system.<ol type="1">
<li>Stay in the land. <a href="ex8.htm#25">8:25-27</a><dd>ie., 'Be a Christian, but not a narrow one.' cp. <a href="2cor6.htm#14">2Cor 6:14-18</a>; <a href="gal1.htm#4">Gal 1:4</a></dd>
<li>Don't go too far away. <a href="ex8.htm#28">8:28-29</a><dd>
ie., 'Don't be too unworldly.' cp. <a href="1sam15.htm#3">1Sam 15:3,20-23</a>; <a href="2pet2.htm#20">2Pet 2:20,21</a></dd>
<li>Go... but leave the children behind. <a href="ex10.htm#8" target="lwr_lt">10:8-11</a>
<dd>Pharaoh initially approved the departure of young and old, but quickly changed his mind, under the pretense of protecting the children from dangers.
</dd><dd>ie., 'Do what is <i>best</i> for the children. Don't expose them to hardship for the sake of Christ.'</dd><dd>Influenced by the world's values, godly parents often pursue worldly prosperity and position for their children, to the neglect of their greater riches.</dd><dd>cp. <a href="ex10.htm#2" target="lwr_lt">v.2</a>; <a href="deu6.htm#6">Deu 6:6-9</a>; <a href="deu11.htm#16">11:16-21</a>; <a href="mat20.htm#20">Mat 20:20,21</a>; <a href="eph6.htm#4">Eph 6:4</a></dd>
<li>Go... but leave your flocks and your herds. <a href="ex10.htm#24" target="lwr_lt">10:24-26</a><dd>ie., 'Don't squander your resources in God's service.'</dd><dd>cp. <a href="mat6.htm#19">Mat 6:19-21</a>; <a href="pro3.htm#9">Prov 3:9,10</a>; <a href="2cor9.htm#6">2Cor 9:6-8</a>; <a href="php4.htm#19">Php 4:19</a></dd><blockquote>
<dt>&quot;Were the whole realm of nature mine, <dd>
That were a present far too small;<dt>
Love so amazing, so divine, <dd>
Demands my heart, my life, my all.&quot;<br>[hymn, 'When I Survey the Wondrous Cross']</blockquote></ol></dl><dt>
<i><b>10:12 And the LORD said unto Moses,<br>Stretch out thine hand over the land of Egypt for the locusts,<br>that they may come up upon the land of Egypt,<br>and eat every herb of the land, [even] all that the hail hath left.<br>
10:13 And Moses stretched forth his rod over the land of Egypt,<br>and the LORD brought an east wind upon the land all that day, and all [that] night;<br>[and] when it was morning, the east wind brought the locusts.<br>
10:14 And the locusts went up over all the land of Egypt,<br>and rested in all the coasts of Egypt: very grievous [were they];<br>before them there were no such locusts as they, neither after them shall be such.<br>
10:15 For they covered the face of the whole earth, so that the land was darkened;<br>and they did eat every herb of the land, and all the fruit of the trees which the hail had left:<br>and there remained not any green thing in the trees, or in the herbs of the field,<br>through all the land of Egypt.<br>
10:16 Then Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron in haste; and he said,<br>I have sinned against the LORD your God, and against you.<br>
10:17 Now therefore forgive, I pray thee, my sin only this once,<br>and intreat the LORD your God, that he may take away from me this death only.<br>
10:18 And he went out from Pharaoh, and intreated the LORD.<br>
10:19 And the LORD turned a mighty strong west wind,<br>which took away the locusts, and cast them into the Red sea;<br>there remained not one locust in all the coasts of Egypt.<br>
10:20 But the LORD hardened Pharaoh's heart,<br>so that he would not let the children of Israel go.</i></b></dt><dl>
<dt>that he may take away... this death only.-
<dd>Pharaoh, ever concerned with the crisis of the moment, failed to understand that the successive plagues foreshadowed eternal judgment. cp. <a href="2cor1.htm#9">2Cor 1:9,10</a>; <a href="heb9.htm#27">Heb 9:27,28</a><br>He was already under the sentence of death, and in great spiritual darkness.</dl><dt>
<b><i>10:21 And the LORD said unto Moses, Stretch out thine hand toward heaven,<br>that there may be darkness over the land of Egypt, even darkness [which] may be felt.<br>
10:22 And Moses stretched forth his hand toward heaven;<br>and there was a thick darkness in all the land of Egypt three days:<br>
10:23 They saw not one another, neither rose any from his place for three days:<br>but all the children of Israel had light in their dwellings.<br>
10:24 And Pharaoh called unto Moses, and said, Go ye, serve the LORD;<br>only let your flocks and your herds be stayed: let your little ones also go with you.<br>
10:25 And Moses said, Thou must give us also sacrifices and burnt offerings,<br>that we may sacrifice unto the LORD our God.<br>
10:26 Our cattle also shall go with us; there shall not an hoof be left behind;<br>for thereof must we take to serve the LORD our God;<br>and we know not with what we must serve the LORD, until we come thither.<br>
10:27 But the LORD hardened </b></i>{HB=chazaq, strengthened}<i><b> Pharaoh's heart,<br>and he would not let them go.</i></b></dt><dl>
<dt>Plague #9 - Darkness 'that could be felt' {HB= mashash, to feel, to grope} (<a href="ex10.htm#21" target="lwr_lt">v.21</a>) <dd>engulfed Egypt for three days (<a href="ex10.htm#23" target="lwr_lt">v.23</a>).<br>But Israel had light in their dwellings (cp. <a href="ex8.htm#22">Ex 8:22</a>; <a href="ex9.htm#4">9:4,26</a>; <a href="isa60.htm#2">Isa 60:2,3</a>; <a href="col1.htm#13">Col 1:13</a>; <a href="1pet2.htm#9">1Pet 2:9</a>).<ul>
<li><i>False gods judged</i> - Ra, the sun god. Horus, a sun god.<dd>
The names 'Potiphar' (<a href="gen39.htm#1">Gen 39:1</a>) and 'Potiphera' (<a href="gen41.htm#45">Gen 41:45</a>) mean 'belonging to Ra (ie., to the Sun).' The city of On was a center of sun worship.<dt>
<li><i>The magicians' response</i> - (silence) cp. <a href="rev16.htm#10">Rev 16:10,11</a><dd>
Pharaoh's servants regarded Moses as a man of 'exceedingly great' importance. (<a href="ex11.htm#3">Ex 11:3</a>)<dt>
<li><i>Pharaoh's response</i> - <ol type="a">
<li>he offered another compromise (which was rejected by Moses).
<li>his heart was hardened... he would not let Israel go...<li>he forbade Moses to see him again.</ol></ul></dl><dt>
<b><i>10:28 And Pharaoh said unto him, Get thee from me, take heed to thyself, see my face no more;<br>for in [that] day thou seest my face thou shalt die.<br>
10:29 And Moses said, Thou hast spoken well, I will see thy face again no more.</i></b></dt><dl>
<dt>Before the morning would come, Pharaoh would expel the children of Israel from Egypt. <dd>Moses would never appear before him again.
