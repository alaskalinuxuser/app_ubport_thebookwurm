23:21 Beware </b></i>{ie., be watchful}<i><b> of him, and obey his voice, provoke him not;<br>for he will not pardon your transgressions: for my name [is] in him.<br>
23:22 But if thou shalt indeed obey his voice, and do all that I speak;<br>then I will be an enemy unto thine enemies, and an adversary unto thine adversaries.<br>
23:23 For mine Angel shall go before thee, and bring thee in unto the Amorites,<br>and the Hittites, and the Perizzites, and the Canaanites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites:<br>and I will cut them off.<br>
23:24 Thou shalt not bow down to their gods, nor serve them, nor do after their works:<br>but thou shalt utterly overthrow them, and quite break down their images.<br>
23:25 And ye shall serve the LORD your God, and he shall bless thy bread, and thy water;<br>and I will take sickness away from the midst of thee. </b></i>{cp. <a href="ex15.htm#26">Ex 15:26</a>}<i><b><br>

23:29 I will not drive them out from before thee in one year;<br>lest the land become desolate, and the beast of the field multiply against thee.<br>
23:30 By little and little I will drive them out from before thee,<br>until thou be increased, and inherit the land. </b></i>{cp. <a href="deu7.htm#20">Deu 7:20-24</a>}<i><b><br>
23:31 And I will set thy bounds from the Red sea even unto the sea of the Philistines,<br>and from the desert unto the river </b></i>{ie., Euphrates}<i><b>:<br>for I will deliver the inhabitants of the land into your hand;<br>and thou shalt drive them out before thee.<br>
23:32 Thou shalt make no covenant with them, nor with their gods.<br>
23:33 They shall not dwell in thy land, lest they make thee sin against me:<br>for if thou serve their gods, it will surely be a snare unto thee.</i></b> {<a href="ex34.htm#12">Ex 34:12-16</a>}</dt><dl>

<dd>Who was this Angel?<ul>
<li>&quot;My name is in him&quot; (<a href="ex23.htm#21" target="lwr_lt">v.21</a>)- HB= shem, name, reputation, glory.<br>This Angel was not a created spirit, but a manifestation of the LORD Himself.
<li>The angel in the pillar of cloud and fire was the Presence of the LORD. cp. <a href="ex13.htm#21">Ex 13:21</a>; <a href="ex14.htm#19">14:19,24</a>
<li>The LORD promised Moses that His Presence would go with them. cp. <a href="ex33.htm#14">Ex 33:14-16</a>
<li>The NT identifies this Presence as Christ. cp. <a href="1cor10.htm#4">1Cor 10:4,9,10</a></ul>
<dt><i>if</i> thou shalt indeed obey his voice, and do all that I speak; <i>then</i>... (<a href="ex23.htm#21" target="lwr_lt">v.21,22</a>)-
<dd>Under the Law, Israel's blessings were (A) based on the LORD's promise,<br>
but (B) realized on condition of their obedience.<br><ol type="A">
<li>The LORD Promised...<ul>
<li>that the reward for obedience would include abundant food, health, reproduction, longevity, victory over their enemies, and complete conquest of the Land... (<a href="ex23.htm#22" target="lwr_lt">v.22-31</a>)
<li>that His Angel (His Presence) would go before them to accomplish these things. <a href="ex23.htm#22" target="lwr_lt">v.22,23</a>
<li>that these blessings would be provided and accomplished by the LORD Himself.<br>(Note how often He says &quot;I will...&quot; in <a href="ex23.htm#22" target="lwr_lt">v.22-31</a>.)</ul>
<li>The condition of Obedience -<ul>
<li>The LORD required that they serve Him fully and exclusively,<dd>separating themselves from all false gods. (cp. <a href="ex23.htm#24" target="lwr_lt">v.24-25,32-33</a>; <a href="ex20.htm#3">Ex 20:3-5</a>).</dd>
<li>Because of disobedience, Israel never occupied the full extent of the promised territory.<br>
Because of idolatry, they were eventually exiled from the land (ie., in the Assyrian and Babylonian captivities).<dd>(cp. the conditional blessings &amp; cursings of <a href="deu28.htm#1">Deu 28:1-14,15-25 f</a>)</dd>
<li>However, the Lord's promises to Israel remain in effect, and will yet be realized,<dd>when they receive their Deliverer, who will take away their sins and give them hearts to obey Him (<a href="deu30.htm#1">Deu 30:1-6</a>; <a href="rom11.htm#26">Rom 11:26,27</a>).</dd></ul></ol>
