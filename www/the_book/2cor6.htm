2Corinthians   6<br> 1. We then, [as] workers together [with him], beseech [you] also that ye receive not the grace of God in vain.<br><a name="2">2</a>  (For he saith, I have heard thee in a time accepted, and in the day of salvation have I succoured thee: behold, now [is] the accepted time; behold, now [is] the day of salvation.)<br><a name="3">3</a>  Giving no offence in any thing, that the ministry be not blamed:<br><a name="4">4</a>  But in all [things] approving ourselves as the ministers of God, in much patience, in afflictions, in necessities, in distresses,<br><a name="5">5</a>  In stripes, in imprisonments, in tumults, in labours, in watchings, in fastings;<br><a name="6">6</a>  By pureness, by knowledge, by longsuffering, by kindness, by the Holy Ghost, by love unfeigned,<br><a name="7">7</a>  By the word of truth, by the power of God, by the armour of righteousness on the right hand and on the left,<br><a name="8">8</a>  By honour and dishonour, by evil report and good report: as deceivers, and [yet] true;<br><a name="9">9</a>  As unknown, and [yet] well known; as dying, and, behold, we live; as chastened, and not killed;<br><a name="10">10</a>  As sorrowful, yet alway rejoicing; as poor, yet making many rich; as having nothing, and [yet] possessing all things.<br><a name="11">11</a>. O [ye] Corinthians, our mouth is open unto you, our heart is enlarged.<br><a name="12">12</a>  Ye are not straitened in us, but ye are straitened in your own bowels.<br><a name="13">13</a>  Now for a recompence in the same, (I speak as unto [my] children,) be ye also enlarged.<br><a name="14">14</a>  Be ye not unequally yoked together with unbelievers: for what fellowship hath righteousness with unrighteousness? and what communion hath light with darkness?<br><a name="15">15</a>  And what concord hath Christ with Belial? or what part hath he that believeth with an infidel?<br><a name="16">16</a>  And what agreement hath the temple of God with idols? for ye are the temple of the living God; as God hath said, I will dwell in them, and walk in [them]; and I will be their God, and they shall be my people.<br><a name="17">17</a>  Wherefore come out from among them, and be ye separate, saith the Lord, and touch not the unclean [thing]; and I will receive you,<br><a name="18">18</a>  And will be a Father unto you, and ye shall be my sons and daughters, saith the Lord Almighty.<br><br>Go to <a href="2cor7.htm#1">II Corinthians 7</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
