James   2<br>1. My brethren, have not the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ, [the Lord] of glory, with respect of persons.<br><a name="2">2</a>  For if there come unto your assembly a man with a gold ring, in goodly apparel, and there come in also a poor man in vile raiment;<br><a name="3">3</a>  And ye have respect to him that weareth the gay clothing, and say unto him, Sit thou here in a good place; and say to the poor, Stand thou there, or sit here under my footstool:<br><a name="4">4</a>  Are ye not then partial in yourselves, and are become judges of evil thoughts?<br><a name="5">5</a>  Hearken, my beloved brethren, Hath not God chosen the poor of this world rich in faith, and heirs of the kingdom which he hath promised to them that love him?<br><a name="6">6</a>  But ye have despised the poor. Do not rich men oppress you, and draw you before the judgment seats?<br><a name="7">7</a>  Do not they blaspheme that worthy name by the which ye are called?<br><a name="8">8</a>. If ye fulfil the royal law according to the scripture, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself, ye do well:<br><a name="9">9</a>  But if ye have respect to persons, ye commit sin, and are convinced of the law as transgressors.<br><a name="10">10</a>  For whosoever shall keep the whole law, and yet offend in one [point], he is guilty of all.<br><a name="11">11</a>  For he that said, Do not commit adultery, said also, Do not kill. Now if thou commit no adultery, yet if thou kill, thou art become a transgressor of the law.<br><a name="12">12</a>  So speak ye, and so do, as they that shall be judged by the law of liberty.<br><a name="13">13</a>  For he shall have judgment without mercy, that hath shewed no mercy; and mercy rejoiceth against judgment.<br><a name="14">14</a>. What [doth it] profit, my brethren, though a man say he hath faith, and have not works? can faith save him?<br><a name="15">15</a>  If a brother or sister be naked, and destitute of daily food,<br><a name="16">16</a>  And one of you say unto them, Depart in peace, be [ye] warmed and filled; notwithstanding ye give them not those things which are needful to the body; what [doth it] profit?<br><a name="17">17</a>  Even so faith, if it hath not works, is dead, being alone.<br><a name="18">18</a>  Yea, a man may say, Thou hast faith, and I have works: shew me thy faith without thy works, and I will shew thee my faith by my works.<br><a name="19">19</a>  Thou believest that there is one God; thou doest well: the devils also believe, and tremble.<br><a name="20">20</a>  But wilt thou know, O vain man, that faith without works is dead?<br><a name="21">21</a>  Was not Abraham our father justified by works, when he had offered Isaac his son upon the altar?<br><a name="22">22</a>  Seest thou how faith wrought with his works, and by works was faith made perfect?<br><a name="23">23</a>  And the scripture was fulfilled which saith, Abraham believed God, and it was imputed unto him for righteousness: and he was called the Friend of God.<br><a name="24">24</a>  Ye see then how that by works a man is justified, and not by faith only.<br><a name="25">25</a>  Likewise also was not Rahab the harlot justified by works, when she had received the messengers, and had sent [them] out another way?<br><a name="26">26</a>  For as the body without the spirit is dead, so faith without works is dead also.<br><br>Go to <a href="jam3.htm#1">James 3</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
