<dt><b>II. Christ in the Pentateuch<br>
1. <a href="gen1.htm#1" target="lwr_lt">Genesis --</a></b>
<dd>Genesis is, in many respects, the most important book in the Bible. Almost all the truths of God's revelation are contained here in germ.<dd>&nbsp;<dd>
<i>''In the beginning God.'' </i>The very first word gives God His right place.<dd>&nbsp;<dd>
<i>''In the beginning</i> God created the heaven and the earth... And God said-- Let Us make man in Our image, after Our likeness'' (<a href="gen1.htm#1" target="lwr_lt">Gen 1:1,26</a>). Here we have the verbs<i> created</i> and <i>said</i> in the singular, the name of God in its plural form--<i> Elohim</i>-- and the plural pronoun <i>Us</i>. [Compare the following passages:]<ul><li><i>''In the beginning</i> was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. The same was <i>in the beginning</i> with God. All things were made by Him, and without Him was not anything made that was made'' (<a href="joh1.htm#1">Joh 1:1-3</a>). <li>''The Lord possessed Me <i>in the beginning</i> of His way, before His works of old. I was set up from everlasting<i> from the beginning,</i> or ever [ie., before] the earth was. When He prepared the heavens, I was there... when He appointed the foundations of the earth.'' (<a href="pro8.htm#22">Prov 8:22-29</a>). <li>''Thou lovedst Me before the foundation of the world,'' Jesus said to His Father when He was about to lay down His life for us (<a href="joh17.htm#24">Joh 17:24</a>).</ul><dd>Thus, in the beginning of all things, we see our everlasting Saviour, the Son of God, ''whom He hath appointed heir of all things, by whom also He made the worlds''  (<a href="heb1.htm#2">Heb 1:2</a>).<dd>&nbsp;<dd>
<dt>Genesis is ''the book of beginnings,'' as the name implies.<ol type="1">
<li><i>The beginning of Creation--</i><br>The account of creation reveals the unity, power, and personality of God.<dd>It denies atheism-- in the beginning <i>God.</i></dd><dd>It denies polytheism-- <i>one </i>God, not many.</dd><dd>It denies pantheism-- God is before all things and<i> apart </i>from them.</dd><dd>It denies materialism-- matter is not God.</dd><dd>It denies the eternity of matter-- in the beginning God<i> created </i>it.</dd><dd>It denies fatalism-- God, here as everywhere, acts in the freedom of His Eternal Being.</dd><dt>
'' 'In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.' In that simple statement, we have the Bible declaration of the origin of the material universe; and it is one in which faith finds reasonable foundation. Interpretation of method may vary, but the essential truth abides. In its dignified and sublime statement, reason may rest as it cannot possibly do in any theory which leaves God out of the question and then finally declares that the first cause was more or less the result of accident, or the existence of laws without mind, or of order without thought.'' [<i>The Analyzed Bible</i>, G. Campbell Morgan, DD]<dt>&nbsp;<dt>
''As time goes on and thoughtful men come to know about the truth of this marvellous universe in which we dwell, they approach closer and closer to Moses' record. Never, perhaps in the history of scientific investigation, did Genesis 1 stand out so solidly and triumphantly as now.'' [<i>Outline Studies in the Books of the Old Testament,</i> W.G. Moorehead, DD]<dt>&nbsp;<dt>
If the harmony is not yet seen to be complete, it is because we have still so much to learn. The <i>theories</i> of Science are continually changing and may clash with Scripture, the ascertained <i>facts</i> never do. In the same way our interpretations of the Bible may clash with Science because we may not interpret it aright, but the Divine record in Scripture will one day be seen to agree absolutely with the Divine record in nature. Meanwhile, it is remarkable how one scientific discovery after another is proving the accuracy of the Scripture statements, clothed as they are in exquisitely simple language.<dt>&nbsp;<dt>
For instance, Herbert Spencer speaks of five factors as ''the most general forms into which the manifestations of the Unknowable are re-divisible.'' These five forms are Space, Time, Matter, Motion, Force. The Holy Spirit has given us these five manifestations of God's creative power in the first two verses of the Bible:

''Through faith, we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God; so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear'' (<a href="heb11.htm#3">Heb 11:3</a>).<dt>&nbsp;<dt>
Thus, God prepared our planet to become the home of man, and, above all, the scene of His supreme revelation of redemption through Christ Jesus.<dt>&nbsp;<dt>Genesis gives us --
<li><i>The beginning of the Human Race</i> (<a href="gen1.htm#26" target="lwr_lt">1:26,27</a>; <a href="gen2.htm#7" target="lwr_lt">2:7</a>). The outline of the divisions of the race, as given in the tenth chapter of Genesis, is in harmony with [modern] theories of ethnology.
<li><i>The origin of the Sabbath.</i>
<li><i>The origin of Marriage</i> and Family (relationships which are foundational to society).--
<li><i>The beginning of Sin and Death--</i> We are introduced at the very beginning to man's great enemy, the devil, and his true character is revealed-- subtilty and deceit.<dd>The result of the Fall of our first parents is manifest in Cain's hatred of his brother, ending in murder. ''And wherefore [why] slew he him? Because his own works were evil and his brother's righteous'' (<a href="1joh3.htm#12">1Joh 3:12</a>) ''This Cain-spirit is seen in the whole line of unbelievers unto this day. It refuses to obey God itself, and hates those who do. Cain hated Abel. Ishmael hated Isaac. Esau hated Jacob. The children of Jacob hated Joseph, and this Cain-spirit hates all who seek salvation through that One offering.'' [<i>In the Volume of the Book</i>, Dr. Pentecost] </dd><dd>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The enmity of the human heart to God found its culmination in the Cross. All the world was then united. ''The kings of the earth stood up, and the rulers were gathered together against the Lord, and against His Christ. For of a truth, against Thy Holy Child Jesus, whom Thou hast anointed, both Herod and Pontius Pilate, with the Gentiles, and the people of Israel, were gathered together'' (<a href="act4.htm#26">Acts 4:26,27</a>).</dd><dd>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The inscription over the Cross was written in Greek and Latin and Hebrew-- the three great languages of the day, the language of the Gentile nations, the language of the Gentile rulers, and the language of the chosen people-- as if to involve the whole world in the guilt. It was also a prophecy of the universal dominion of the King of kings.</dd>
<li><i>The beginning of Grace,</i> as shown in the promise of a Redeemer, in the institution of sacrifice, and in God's Covenant.<dd>As the redemption of man-- the restoration of God's image which man had lost in the Fall-- is the great object of God's revelation in the Bible, we find its beginning here in Genesis.</dd><dd>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
The first two chapters of the Bible speak of man's <i>innocence</i>, what he was before the Fall. The last two chapters of the Bible speak of man's <i>holiness</i>, what he shall become; sin is not mentioned in them, except the fact that it is absolutely excluded from the Holy City. All the chapters in between-- the whole book right through-- speak of the conflict between God and sin.'' (C.L.Maynard)</dd>
<li><i>The beginning of the Chosen Race--</i> Genesis shows us the utter failure of man.<dd>Adam failed. God gave the race a new start in Noah. But the new race failed, and ended in universal idolatry. Then God called Abram, and from this time He deals with mankind through the chosen race. But the chosen race failed, and in the end of the Old Testament history, we see Him dealing only with the faithful remnant. [The whole world was in need of salvation from sin. God chose Israel as the nation through which He would send the Saviour into the world.]</dd></ol><dt>&nbsp;
<dt>The Book of Genesis falls naturally into two parts:<ol type="1">
<li><b>Chapters 1-11,</b> a very brief but comprehensive history of the world from <dd>the <i>creation to the confusion of tongues.</i><dt>
<b><li>Chapters 12-50,</b> the history of <i>Abraham and his family</i>, <dd>to the death of his great-grandson Joseph.</ol><dt>&nbsp;
<dt>[In Genesis there are two distinct streams of revelation concerning Christ.]--<b><br>
I. Prophecies--</b><ul>
<li>We have the glorious promise (in <a href="gen3.htm#15" target="lwr_lt">Gen 3:15</a>) of<i> the Seed of the woman</i> which was to bruise the serpent's head, though the serpent should bruise His heal.<dd>The fulfillment is summed up in <a href="heb2.htm#9">Heb 2:9-14</a>: ''We see Jesus, who was made a little lower than the angels for the suffering of death, crowned with glory and honour... Forasmuch then as the children are partakers of flesh and blood, He also Himself likewise took part of the same; that through death He might destroy him that had the power of death, that is the devil.''</dd><dd>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;There were the promises repeated to Abraham of blessing to the whole world through his Seed. ''In thy Seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed'' (<a href="gen22.htm#18" target="lwr_lt">Gen 22:18</a>; <a href="gen12.htm#3" target="lwr_lt">12:3</a>; <a href="gen17.htm#7" target="lwr_lt">17:7</a>; <a href="gen21.htm#12" target="lwr_lt">21:12</a>). This promise was repeated to Isaac (<a href="gen26.htm#4" target="lwr_lt">Gen 26:4</a>) and again to Jacob (<a href="gen28.htm#14" target="lwr_lt">28:14</a>).</dd>
<li>Then again there was the blessing of Judah (<a href="gen49.htm#9" target="lwr_lt">Gen 49:9,10</a>), ''Judah is a lion's whelp.''<dd>The Lord Jesus is ''<i>the Lion of the tribe of Judah</i>'' (<a href="rev5.htm#5">Rev 5:5</a>). <br>''The sceptre shall not depart from Judah until Shiloh come, and unto Him shall the gathering of the people be.'' Shiloh, [means:] ''the man of rest, or peace,'' or ''He whose right it is.'' ''He shall be great, and shall be called the Son of the Highest; and the Lord God shall give unto Him the throne of His father David: and He shall reign over the house of Jacob for ever; and of His kingdom there shall be no end'' (<a href="luk1.htm#32">Luk 1:32,33</a>)</dd></ul>
<dt><b>II. Types--</b><br>In Genesis, we have individual men who are types [pictures, illustrations] of Christ.<ul>
<li><i>Adam,</i> as being the head of the race, and also by contrast.<dd>Adam was tempted by the devil and failed (<a href="gen3.htm#1" target="lwr_lt">Gen 3</a>).</dd><dd>Christ was tempted by the devil and triumphed (<a href="mat4.htm#1">Mat 4</a>).</dd><dd>''As by one man's disobedience many were made sinners, so by the obedience of One shall many be made righteous'' (<a href="rom5.htm#19">Rom 5:19</a>).</dd>
<li><i>Melchizedek--</i> <a href="gen14.htm#17" target="lwr_lt">Gen 14:17-20</a><dd>
<table border=2 width=85% cellpadding=2 cellspacing=2>
<tr><td><b>Melchizedek-</b> <br>ie., 'King of Righteousness'</td><td><b>Messiah-</b><br>A King shall reign in righteousness. <a href="isa32.htm#1">Isa 32:1</a></td></tr>
<tr><td>King of Salem- <br>ie., 'King of Peace'</td><td>His name shall be called the Prince of Peace. <a href="isa9.htm#6">Isa 9:6,7</a></td></tr>
<tr><td>King and Priest</td><td>He shall sit and rule upon His throne, and shall be a Priest. <a href="zech6.htm#13">Zech 6:13</a> (Both offices are united only in Christ.)</td></tr>
<tr><td>Made like unto the Son of God. <a href="heb7.htm#3">Heb 7:3</a></td><td>A Great High Priest that is passed into the heavens, Jesus the Son of God. <a href="heb4.htm#14">Heb 4:14</a></td></tr>
<tr><td>Having neither beginning of days nor end of life.</td><td>He ever liveth to make intercession. <a href="heb7.htm#25">Heb 7:25</a></td></tr>
<tr><td>Abideth a priest continually.</td><td>But this man, because He continueth ever, hath an unchangeable priesthood. <a href="heb7.htm#24">Heb 7:24</a></td></tr>
<tr><td>Met Abraham after his victory, refreshed him with bread and wine, and blessed him. <a href="gen14.htm#18" target="lwr_lt">Gen 14:18</a></td><td>So Christ draws near to us, and gives us communion with Himself after times of conflict in which He has given us the victory.</td></tr>
</table></dd>
<li><i>Isaac--</i> In <i>the offering of Isaac</i>, we have one of the most perfect pictures of the great sacrifice offered on Calvary...  Let us tread softly as we follow it step by step, for we are on holy ground.<dd>
<table border=2 width=85% cellpadding=2 cellspacing=2>
<tr><td><b>Mount Moriah</b> (<a href="gen22.htm#1" target="lwr_lt">Gen 22</a>)</td><td><b>Mount Calvary</b></td></tr>

<tr><td>v.6. And Abraham took the wood of the burnt offering, and laid it upon Isaac his son.</td><td><a href="joh19.htm#17">Joh 19:17</a>. And He, bearing His cross, went forth. (See <a href="joh18.htm#11">Joh 18:11</a>)</td></tr>
<tr><td>and they went both of them together.</td><td><a href="joh10.htm#17">Joh 10:17,18</a>. Therefore doth my Father love Me, because I lay down My life. No man taketh it from Me, but I lay it down of Myself... This commandment have I received from my Father.</td></tr>

<tr><td>v.10. And Abraham stretched forth his hand, and took the knife to slay his son.</td><td><a href="isa53.htm#10">Isa 53:10</a>. It pleased the Lord to bruise Him.<br><a href="mat27.htm#46">Mat 27:46</a>. My God, My God, why hast Thou forsaken Me?</td></tr>

(No one type can picture all of Christ's work for us, the ram is needed here to complete it.)</dd>
<li>In<i> Joseph</i>, we have a picture of Christ's life and character.<dd>We can only trace the outline, leaving the details. [For more, see the <i>Book Notes</i> on Genesis.] We see him beloved of his father, sold by his brothers at the price of a slave, taking upon him the form of a servant, resisting temptation, condemned, bound, exalted to be a prince and a saviour, giving the bread of life to the world. In <a href="gen50.htm#20" target="lwr_lt">Gen 50:20</a> and <a href="act2.htm#23">Acts 2:23</a>, we have almost parallel passages showing the great salvation in both cases to be the combined result of human wickedness and Divine purpose.</dd>
<li>In<i> Judah</i>, we have a picture of the<i> Surety</i> and Substitute (<a href="gen43.htm#9" target="lwr_lt">Gen 43:9</a>; <a href="gen44.htm#32" target="lwr_lt">44:32-34</a>).</ul><dt>&nbsp;
<dt>Coming to other types [where 'things' or 'events' illustrate the work of Christ]--<ul>
<li>We see in <a href="gen3.htm#18" target="lwr_lt">Gen 3:18</a> the curse pronounced upon sin, of which<i> the thorns</i> were the emblem. This very emblem our Saviour bore upon His brow when He was made a curse for us.
<li>In<i> Abel's offering,</i> we see the Lamb of God (<a href="gen4.htm#4" target="lwr_lt">Gen 4:4</a>).
<dd>We see the same in the various instances in Genesis of<i> God's Covenant </i>  with man, it was always founded upon sacrifice (<a href="gen8.htm#20" target="lwr_lt">Gen 8:20</a>; <a href="gen9.htm#11" target="lwr_lt">9:11-17</a>; <a href="gen15.htm#9" target="lwr_lt">15:9-18</a>). Jesus is the Surety and the Sacrifice of the better Covenant, of which all these Covenants were the type (<a href="heb7.htm#22">Heb 7:22</a>).</dd><dd>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Again, through the Book of Genesis, we have repeatedly the record of<i> an altar</i>, pointing forward to the One Sacrifice (<a href="gen8.htm#20" target="lwr_lt">Gen 8:20</a>; <a href="gen12.htm#8" target="lwr_lt">12:8</a>; <a href="gen26.htm#25" target="lwr_lt">26:25</a>; <a href="gen35.htm#1" target="lwr_lt">35:1,3,7</a>).</dd><dd>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And there, right away at the beginning of God's Book, in <a href="gen9.htm#4" target="lwr_lt">Gen 9:4</a>, we are told the meaning of <i>the blood. &quot;The blood thereof, which is the life thereof.&quot;</i> Modern science has revealed the vital importance of the blood, but God told it to us from the very beginning. And in the Bible, where ever we read of blood, it is almost always of blood shed; therefore if the blood is the <i>life,</i> blood <i>shed</i> is <i>death,</i> the death of Christ for us as our Sacrifice.</dd>
<li>In the<i> Ark</i>, we see the Salvation God has provided for us in Christ. ''<i>A Man </i>shall be as an hiding place from the wind, and a covert from the tempest'' (<a href="isa32.htm#2">Isa 32:2</a>).<dd>
<table border=2 width=85% cellpadding=2 cellspacing=2>
<tr><td><a href="gen6.htm#5" target="lwr_lt">Gen 6:5,7</a>. God saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth... and the Lord said, I will destroy man whom I have created from the face of the earth.<br><a href="2pet3.htm#6">2Pet 3:6</a>. Whereby the world that then was being overflowed with water, perished.</td><td><a href="2pet3.htm#7">2Pet 3:7,11</a>. But the heavens and the earth which are now, by the same word, are kept in store, reserved unto fire against the day of judgment and perdition of ungodly men...

<li>We have a picture of the Church, the Bride of Christ,<i> in the Story of Rebekah</i> (<a href="gen24.htm#1" target="lwr_lt">Gen 24</a>), who was willing to forget her own people and her father's house to go to be the bride of Isaac.
<li>In<i> Jacob's ladder--</i> bridging the gulf from earth to heaven-- we have a picture of the Cross, which has for ever bridged that gulf for us.</ul><dt>&nbsp;
<dt>Furthermore, we have in Genesis appearances of Jehovah Himself in human form, under the name of <i>the Angel of Jehovah.</i> Surely, this is none other than Christ Himself, God manifest in the flesh, who said, ''Before Abraham was, I AM.''<ul><li>In <a href="gen16.htm#7" target="lwr_lt">Genesis 16:7-14</a>, He appeared to Hagar saying, '' I will multiply thy seed exceedingly.'' This is language suited only to Jehovah Himself. ''And she called the name of Jehovah that spake unto her: Thou God seest me,'' or as the Jews more correctly render the clause, ''Thou art God, visible to me.'' <li>In <a href="gen18.htm#1" target="lwr_lt">Gen 18</a>, Jehovah appeared to Abraham in the plains of Mamre. Abraham lifted up his eyes and saw three men; he provided food for them, which they ate. <a href="gen18.htm#22" target="lwr_lt">Verse 22</a> and chapter <a href="gen19.htm#1" target="lwr_lt">19:1</a> show that two of these heavenly visitors (''angels'') went toward Sodom, but Abraham stood yet before the third, Jehovah. <li>In <a href="gen22.htm#11" target="lwr_lt">Genesis 22:11,15,16</a>, we find the same Angel of Jehovah calling to Abraham from heaven and saying, ''By Myself have I sworn, saith Jehovah,'' showing again that the names <i>Jehovah</i> and <i>Angel of Jehovah</i> are used interchangeably. <li>In <a href="gen31.htm#11" target="lwr_lt">Genesis 31:11,13</a>, this same Angel (called this time, the Angel of God) speaking to Jacob, says, ''I am the God of Bethel.'' <li>In <a href="gen32.htm#24" target="lwr_lt">Genesis 32</a>, we have an account of the man who wrestled with Jacob till the breaking of the day. He changed Jacob's name to Israel, a prince of God, ''for thou hast striven with God and with man, and hast prevailed... And Jacob called the name of the place Peniel-- the Face of God-- for I have seen God face to face and my life is preserved.''<br>- - Surely, this is none other than the Son of God, who is the effulgence of the Father's glory, and the express image of His substance (<a href="heb1.htm#3">Heb 1:3</a>, RV).</ul></dl>
