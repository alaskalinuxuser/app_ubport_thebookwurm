Hebrews   2<br> 1. Therefore we ought to give the more earnest heed to the things which we have heard, lest at any time we should let [them] slip.<br><a name="2">2</a>  For if the word spoken by angels was stedfast, and every transgression and disobedience received a just recompence of reward;<br><a name="3">3</a>  How shall we escape, if we neglect so great salvation; which at the first began to be spoken by the Lord, and was confirmed unto us by them that heard [him];<br><a name="4">4</a>  God also bearing [them] witness, both with signs and wonders, and with divers miracles, and gifts of the Holy Ghost, according to his own will?<br><a name="5">5</a>. For unto the angels hath he not put in subjection the world to come, whereof we speak.<br><a name="6">6</a>  But one in a certain place testified, saying, What is man, that thou art mindful of him? or the son of man, that thou visitest him?<br><a name="7">7</a>  Thou madest him a little lower than the angels; thou crownedst him with glory and honour, and didst set him over the works of thy hands:<br><a name="8">8</a>  Thou hast put all things in subjection under his feet. For in that he put all in subjection under him, he left nothing [that is] not put under him. But now we see not yet all things put under him.<br><a name="9">9</a>  But we see Jesus, who was made a little lower than the angels for the suffering of death, crowned with glory and honour; that he by the grace of God should taste death for every man.<br><a name="10">10</a>. For it became him, for whom [are] all things, and by whom [are] all things, in bringing many sons unto glory, to make the captain of their salvation perfect through sufferings.<br><a name="11">11</a>  For both he that sanctifieth and they who are sanctified [are] all of one: for which cause he is not ashamed to call them brethren,<br><a name="12">12</a>  Saying, I will declare thy name unto my brethren, in the midst of the church will I sing praise unto thee.<br><a name="13">13</a>  And again, I will put my trust in him. And again, Behold I and the children which God hath given me.<br><a name="14">14</a>. Forasmuch then as the children are partakers of flesh and blood, he also himself likewise took part of the same; that through death he might destroy him that had the power of death, that is, the devil;<br><a name="15">15</a>  And deliver them who through fear of death were all their lifetime subject to bondage.<br><a name="16">16</a>  For verily he took not on [him the nature of] angels; but he took on [him] the seed of Abraham.<br><a name="17">17</a>  Wherefore in all things it behoved him to be made like unto [his] brethren, that he might be a merciful and faithful high priest in things [pertaining] to God, to make reconciliation for the sins of the people.<br><a name="18">18</a>  For in that he himself hath suffered being tempted, he is able to succour them that are tempted.<br><br>Go to <a href="heb3.htm#1">Hebrews 3</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
