<b><a href="psa102.htm#1" target="lwr_lt">PSALM 102</a> - Messiah: The Lord of Glory, afflicted but enduring.</b><br><dl>
<dt><i><b>102:1 A Prayer of the afflicted,<br>
when he is overwhelmed, and poureth out his complaint before the LORD. </b></i></dt><dl>
<dt>Verse 1 introduces the heavy tone of this psalm.
<dt>the afflicted - The afflicted one is not named. More than one voice can be heard:<ol type="A">
<li>The psalmist expresses his profound personal grief for the national decline of Israel (ie., which led to the Babylonian captivity of Jerusalem, and the interruption of the Davidic Kingdom), and despairs of seeing the promised restoration in his lifetime. cp. <a href="psa89.htm#38">Psa 89:38-45</a>; <a href="lam1.htm#1">Lam 1:1-22</a> 
<li>The Messiah personally bears the sorrows of His people (eg., at Gethsemane &amp; Calvary). <a href="isa63.htm#9">Isa 63:9</a>; <a href="psa22.htm#24">Psa 22:24</a><dd>The book of Hebrews quotes <a href="psa102.htm#25" target="lwr_lt">v.25-27</a> as being spoken by God the Father to God the Son.</dd></ol>
<dd>In the first eleven verses of this psalm, the voices of the psalmist and our suffering Savior are inter-mingled.<dd>After that, we overhear the deep communion of the Father and His Son.</dl><dt>&nbsp;
<dd><b>1. The Afflicted One laments the days of decline. <a href="psa102.htm#1" target="lwr_lt">vs.1-11</a></b>

<dt><b><i>102:6 I am like a pelican of the wilderness:<br>
I am like an owl of the desert. </b></i></dt><dl>
<dt>ie., As a bird, I live in desolation... devoid of both shelter and storehouse. 
<dd><a href="isa34.htm#11">Isa 34:11-14</a>; <a href="isa38.htm#14">Isa 38:14</a></dl>
<dt><i><b>102:7 I watch, and am as a sparrow alone upon the house top. </b></i></dt><dl>
<dt>ie., As a small frail bird, I look for the comfort of a companion...
<dd>...but I remain alone. <a href="psa69.htm#20">Psa 69:20</a></dl>
<dt><i><b>102:8 Mine enemies reproach me all the day;<br>
[and] they that are mad against me are sworn against me. </b></i></dt><dl>
<dt>sworn against me - ie., bound with an oath against me.

<dd>(also: <b> The Father previews the Son's Glory as the Redeemer.</b>)
<br>As we will see, the Holy Spirit quoted <a href="psa102.htm#25" target="lwr_lt">v.25-28</a> as applying to the Messiah (in the book of Hebrews). Because those verses conclude the conversation which precedes them, it is evident that this section also applies to Christ.</dl> 
<dt><i><b>102:12 But thou, O LORD, shalt endure </b></i>{ie., sit}<i><b> for ever; </b></i></dt><dl>
<dt>Or: &quot;Thou, O Jehovah, shalt sit enthroned as King forever.&quot; [GWms] 
<dd>The LORD is the Great King, though the Davidic Kingdom lacks a king on the throne in Jerusalem. <a href="psa9.htm#7">Psa 9:7</a>; <a href="lam5.htm#19">Lam 5:19</a></dl>
<dt><i><b>and thy remembrance unto all generations. </b></i></dt><dl>
