Ezekiel   4<br>1. Thou also, son of man, take thee a tile, and lay it before thee, and pourtray upon it the city, [even] Jerusalem:<br><a name="2">2</a>  And lay siege against it, and build a fort against it, and cast a mount against it; set the camp also against it, and set [battering] rams against it round about.<br><a name="3">3</a>  Moreover take thou unto thee an iron pan, and set it [for] a wall of iron between thee and the city: and set thy face against it, and it shall be besieged, and thou shalt lay siege against it. This [shall be] a sign to the house of Israel.<br><a name="4">4</a>  Lie thou also upon thy left side, and lay the iniquity of the house of Israel upon it: [according] to the number of the days that thou shalt lie upon it thou shalt bear their iniquity.<br><a name="5">5</a>  For I have laid upon thee the years of their iniquity, according to the number of the days, three hundred and ninety days: so shalt thou bear the iniquity of the house of Israel.<br><a name="6">6</a>  And when thou hast accomplished them, lie again on thy right side, and thou shalt bear the iniquity of the house of Judah forty days: I have appointed thee each day for a year.<br><a name="7">7</a>  Therefore thou shalt set thy face toward the siege of Jerusalem, and thine arm [shall be] uncovered, and thou shalt prophesy against it.<br><a name="8">8</a>  And, behold, I will lay bands upon thee, and thou shalt not turn thee from one side to another, till thou hast ended the days of thy siege.<br><a name="9">9</a>. Take thou also unto thee wheat, and barley, and beans, and lentiles, and millet, and fitches, and put them in one vessel, and make thee bread thereof, [according] to the number of the days that thou shalt lie upon thy side, three hundred and ninety days shalt thou eat thereof.<br><a name="10">10</a>  And thy meat which thou shalt eat [shall be] by weight, twenty shekels a day: from time to time shalt thou eat it.<br><a name="11">11</a>  Thou shalt drink also water by measure, the sixth part of an hin: from time to time shalt thou drink.<br><a name="12">12</a>  And thou shalt eat it [as] barley cakes, and thou shalt bake it with dung that cometh out of man, in their sight.<br><a name="13">13</a>  And the LORD said, Even thus shall the children of Israel eat their defiled bread among the Gentiles, whither I will drive them.<br><a name="14">14</a>  Then said I, Ah Lord GOD! behold, my soul hath not been polluted: for from my youth up even till now have I not eaten of that which dieth of itself, or is torn in pieces; neither came there abominable flesh into my mouth.<br><a name="15">15</a>  Then he said unto me, Lo, I have given thee cow's dung for man's dung, and thou shalt prepare thy bread therewith.<br><a name="16">16</a>  Moreover he said unto me, Son of man, behold, I will break the staff of bread in Jerusalem: and they shall eat bread by weight, and with care; and they shall drink water by measure, and with astonishment:<br><a name="17">17</a>  That they may want bread and water, and be astonied one with another, and consume away for their iniquity.<br><br>Go to <a href="eze5.htm#1">Ezekiel 5</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
