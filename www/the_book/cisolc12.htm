<b>Volume 3, Lesson 12</b><br>
by C.I. Scofield
<h2>The Believer's Standing and State</h2></center>
<p>A distinction of vast importance to the right understanding of the Scriptures, especially of the Epistles, is that which concerns the <i>standing</i> (position) of the believer, and his <i>state</i> (practice).</p>
<b><ol type="A">
<li>Standing</b><br>Standing is the result of the work of Christ, and is perfect and entire from the very moment that Christ is received in faith. Nothing adds in the smallest degree to the believer's title to God's favor, nor to his perfect security. Faith alone gives a believer his standing in God's sight, and before Him, the weakest, most ignorant, most infirm and fallible man on earth, if he be but a true believer on the Lord Jesus Christ, has precisely the same title as the most illustrious saint.<ol type="1">
<li>What is the standing of the believer?<ul>
<li><a href="joh1.htm#12">John 1:12</a> - &quot;To them gave He power to become the sons of God&quot;
<li><a href="1joh3.htm#2">1John 3:2</a> - &quot;Now are we the sons of God&quot;
<li><a href="1pet2.htm#9">1Peter 2:9</a> - &quot;Ye are a chosen generation&quot;
<li><a href="rev1.htm#5">Revelation 1:5,6</a> - &quot;Hath made us kings and priests&quot;
<li><a href="eph2.htm#4">Ephesians 2:4-6</a> - &quot;Hath... made us sit together in heavenly places&quot;
<li><a href="1joh5.htm#1">1John 5:1</a> - &quot;Born of God&quot;
<li><a href="rom8.htm#17">Romans 8:17</a> - &quot;Joint-heirs with Christ&quot;
<li><a href="joh3.htm#16">John 3:16</a> - &quot;Have everlasting life&quot;
<li><a href="1joh5.htm#13">1John 5:13</a> - &quot;Have eternal life&quot;
<li><a href="heb10.htm#19">Hebrews 10:19</a> - &quot;Having... boldness to enter&quot;
<li><a href="eph5.htm#30">Ephesians 5:30</a> - &quot;We are members of His body&quot;
<li><a href="1cor6.htm#19">1Corinthians 6:19</a> - &quot;Your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost&quot;</ul>
Every one of these marvelous things is true of every believer on the Lord Jesus Christ. Not one item in this glorious inventory is said to be gained by prayer or by diligence in service, or by church going, or by alms giving, or self-denial, or holiness in life, or by any other description of good works. All is the gift of God, through Christ, through faith, and therefore belongs equally to all believers. The very instant that the brutal jailer of Philippi believed on the Lord Jesus Christ, he became a child of God, a joint heir with Christ, a king and a priest, and the owner of an incorruptible, undefiled, and unfading inheritance.<br>&nbsp;
<li>How believers receive their standing<ul>
<li><a href="1cor6.htm#11">1Corinthians 6:11</a> - &quot;Washed... sanctified... justified&quot;
<li><a href="col1.htm#12">Colossians 1:12-14</a> - &quot;We have redemption through His blood... forgiveness of sins&quot;
<li><a href="2tim1.htm#9">2Timothy 1:9</a> - &quot;Hath saved us, and called us&quot;
<li><a href="heb10.htm#14">Hebrews 10:14</a> - &quot;By one offering He hath perfected for ever&quot;</ul></ol><b>
<li>State</b><br>
State refers to the day-to-day walk of a believer. It is determined by daily choices regarding obedience or disobedience, as well as the manner of living of the believer. State often affects the believer's joy, peace, and contentment while on earth.<ul>
<li><a href="col3.htm#8">Colossians 3:8,9</a> - &quot;Put off all anger, wrath, malice, blasphemy, filthy communications&quot;
<li><a href="php2.htm#12">Philippians 2:12-15</a> - &quot;Shine as lights in this world&quot;
<li><a href="gal5.htm#16">Galatians 5:16</a> - &quot;Walk in the Spirit&quot;
<li><a href="col3.htm#12">Colossians 3:12-25</a> - &quot;Put on... kindness, humbleness of mind, meekness, longsuffering; forbearing one another... let the peace of God rule in your hearts&quot;
<li><a href="php3.htm#14">Philippians 3:14</a> - &quot;Press toward the mark&quot;
<li><a href="php2.htm#12">Philippians 2:12</a> - &quot;Work out your own salvation with fear and trembling.&quot; The believer is not exhorted to work <i>for</i> his own salvation, but to work <i>out,</i> in service and testimony, what God works <i>in</i> him.</ul></ol>
