Ecclesiastes   8<br>1. Who [is] as the wise [man]? and who knoweth the interpretation of a thing? a man's wisdom maketh his face to shine, and the boldness of his face shall be changed.<br><a name="2">2</a>  I [counsel thee] to keep the king's commandment, and [that] in regard of the oath of God.<br><a name="3">3</a>  Be not hasty to go out of his sight: stand not in an evil thing; for he doeth whatsoever pleaseth him.<br><a name="4">4</a>  Where the word of a king [is, there is] power: and who may say unto him, What doest thou?<br><a name="5">5</a>  Whoso keepeth the commandment shall feel no evil thing: and a wise man's heart discerneth both time and judgment.<br><a name="6">6</a>. Because to every purpose there is time and judgment, therefore the misery of man [is] great upon him.<br><a name="7">7</a>  For he knoweth not that which shall be: for who can tell him when it shall be?<br><a name="8">8</a>  [There is] no man that hath power over the spirit to retain the spirit; neither [hath he] power in the day of death: and [there is] no discharge in [that] war; neither shall wickedness deliver those that are given to it.<br><a name="9">9</a>. All this have I seen, and applied my heart unto every work that is done under the sun: [there is] a time wherein one man ruleth over another to his own hurt.<br><a name="10">10</a>  And so I saw the wicked buried, who had come and gone from the place of the holy, and they were forgotten in the city where they had so done: this [is] also vanity.<br><a name="11">11</a>  Because sentence against an evil work is not executed speedily, therefore the heart of the sons of men is fully set in them to do evil.<br><a name="12">12</a>  Though a sinner do evil an hundred times, and his [days] be prolonged, yet surely I know that it shall be well with them that fear God, which fear before him:<br><a name="13">13</a>  But it shall not be well with the wicked, neither shall he prolong [his] days, [which are] as a shadow; because he feareth not before God.<br><a name="14">14</a>. There is a vanity which is done upon the earth; that there be just [men], unto whom it happeneth according to the work of the wicked; again, there be wicked [men], to whom it happeneth according to the work of the righteous: I said that this also [is] vanity.<br><a name="15">15</a>  Then I commended mirth, because a man hath no better thing under the sun, than to eat, and to drink, and to be merry: for that shall abide with him of his labour the days of his life, which God giveth him under the sun.<br><a name="16">16</a>  When I applied mine heart to know wisdom, and to see the business that is done upon the earth: (for also [there is that] neither day nor night seeth sleep with his eyes:)<br><a name="17">17</a>  Then I beheld all the work of God, that a man cannot find out the work that is done under the sun: because though a man labour to seek [it] out, yet he shall not find [it]; yea further; though a wise [man] think to know [it], yet shall he not be able to find [it].<br><br>Go to <a href="ecc9.htm#1">Ecclesiastes 9</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
