2Timothy   1<br>1. Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, according to the promise of life which is in Christ Jesus,<br><a name="2">2</a>  To Timothy, [my] dearly beloved son: Grace, mercy, [and] peace, from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.<br><a name="3">3</a>  I thank God, whom I serve from [my] forefathers with pure conscience, that without ceasing I have remembrance of thee in my prayers night and day;<br><a name="4">4</a>  Greatly desiring to see thee, being mindful of thy tears, that I may be filled with joy;<br><a name="5">5</a>  When I call to remembrance the unfeigned faith that is in thee, which dwelt first in thy grandmother Lois, and thy mother Eunice; and I am persuaded that in thee also.<br><a name="6">6</a>. Wherefore I put thee in remembrance that thou stir up the gift of God, which is in thee by the putting on of my hands.<br><a name="7">7</a>  For God hath not given us the spirit of fear; but of power, and of love, and of a sound mind.<br><a name="8">8</a>  Be not thou therefore ashamed of the testimony of our Lord, nor of me his prisoner: but be thou partaker of the afflictions of the gospel according to the power of God;<br><a name="9">9</a>  Who hath saved us, and called [us] with an holy calling, not according to our works, but according to his own purpose and grace, which was given us in Christ Jesus before the world began,<br><a name="10">10</a>  But is now made manifest by the appearing of our Saviour Jesus Christ, who hath abolished death, and hath brought life and immortality to light through the gospel:<br><a name="11">11</a>  Whereunto I am appointed a preacher, and an apostle, and a teacher of the Gentiles.<br><a name="12">12</a>  For the which cause I also suffer these things: nevertheless I am not ashamed: for I know whom I have believed, and am persuaded that he is able to keep that which I have committed unto him against that day.<br><a name="13">13</a>  Hold fast the form of sound words, which thou hast heard of me, in faith and love which is in Christ Jesus.<br><a name="14">14</a>  That good thing which was committed unto thee keep by the Holy Ghost which dwelleth in us.<br><a name="15">15</a>. This thou knowest, that all they which are in Asia be turned away from me; of whom are Phygellus and Hermogenes.<br><a name="16">16</a>  The Lord give mercy unto the house of Onesiphorus; for he oft refreshed me, and was not ashamed of my chain:<br><a name="17">17</a>  But, when he was in Rome, he sought me out very diligently, and found [me].<br><a name="18">18</a>  The Lord grant unto him that he may find mercy of the Lord in that day: and in how many things he ministered unto me at Ephesus, thou knowest very well.<br><br>Go to <a href="2tim2.htm#1">II Timothy 2</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
