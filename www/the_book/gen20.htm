Genesis  20<br>1. And Abraham journeyed from thence toward the south country, and dwelled between Kadesh and Shur, and sojourned in Gerar.<br><a name="2">2</a>  And Abraham said of Sarah his wife, She [is] my sister: and Abimelech king of Gerar sent, and took Sarah.<br><a name="3">3</a>. But God came to Abimelech in a dream by night, and said to him, Behold, thou [art but] a dead man, for the woman which thou hast taken; for she [is] a man's wife.<br><a name="4">4</a>  But Abimelech had not come near her: and he said, Lord, wilt thou slay also a righteous nation?<br><a name="5">5</a>  Said he not unto me, She [is] my sister? and she, even she herself said, He [is] my brother: in the integrity of my heart and innocency of my hands have I done this.<br><a name="6">6</a>  And God said unto him in a dream, Yea, I know that thou didst this in the integrity of thy heart; for I also withheld thee from sinning against me: therefore suffered I thee not to touch her.<br><a name="7">7</a>  Now therefore restore the man [his] wife; for he [is] a prophet, and he shall pray for thee, and thou shalt live: and if thou restore [her] not, know thou that thou shalt surely die, thou, and all that [are] thine.<br><a name="8">8</a>. Therefore Abimelech rose early in the morning, and called all his servants, and told all these things in their ears: and the men were sore afraid.<br><a name="9">9</a>  Then Abimelech called Abraham, and said unto him, What hast thou done unto us? and what have I offended thee, that thou hast brought on me and on my kingdom a great sin? thou hast done deeds unto me that ought not to be done.<br><a name="10">10</a>  And Abimelech said unto Abraham, What sawest thou, that thou hast done this thing?<br><a name="11">11</a>  And Abraham said, Because I thought, Surely the fear of God [is] not in this place; and they will slay me for my wife's sake.<br><a name="12">12</a>  And yet indeed [she is] my sister; she [is] the daughter of my father, but not the daughter of my mother; and she became my wife.<br><a name="13">13</a>  And it came to pass, when God caused me to wander from my father's house, that I said unto her, This [is] thy kindness which thou shalt shew unto me; at every place whither we shall come, say of me, He [is] my brother.<br><a name="14">14</a>. And Abimelech took sheep, and oxen, and menservants, and womenservants, and gave [them] unto Abraham, and restored him Sarah his wife.<br><a name="15">15</a>  And Abimelech said, Behold, my land [is] before thee: dwell where it pleaseth thee.<br><a name="16">16</a>  And unto Sarah he said, Behold, I have given thy brother a thousand [pieces] of silver: behold, he [is] to thee a covering of the eyes, unto all that [are] with thee, and with all [other]: thus she was reproved.<br><a name="17">17</a>  So Abraham prayed unto God: and God healed Abimelech, and his wife, and his maidservants; and they bare [children].<br><a name="18">18</a>  For the LORD had fast closed up all the wombs of the house of Abimelech, because of Sarah Abraham's wife.<br><br>Go to <a href="gen21.htm#1">Genesis 21</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
