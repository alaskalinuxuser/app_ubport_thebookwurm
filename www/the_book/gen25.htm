Genesis  25<br>1. Then again Abraham took a wife, and her name [was] Keturah.<br><a name="2">2</a>  And she bare him Zimran, and Jokshan, and Medan, and Midian, and Ishbak, and Shuah.<br><a name="3">3</a>  And Jokshan begat Sheba, and Dedan. And the sons of Dedan were Asshurim, and Letushim, and Leummim.<br><a name="4">4</a>  And the sons of Midian; Ephah, and Epher, and Hanoch, and Abida, and Eldaah. All these [were] the children of Keturah.<br><a name="5">5</a>  And Abraham gave all that he had unto Isaac.<br><a name="6">6</a>  But unto the sons of the concubines, which Abraham had, Abraham gave gifts, and sent them away from Isaac his son, while he yet lived, eastward, unto the east country.<br><a name="7">7</a>  And these [are] the days of the years of Abraham's life which he lived, an hundred threescore and fifteen years.<br><a name="8">8</a>  Then Abraham gave up the ghost, and died in a good old age, an old man, and full [of years]; and was gathered to his people.<br><a name="9">9</a>  And his sons Isaac and Ishmael buried him in the cave of Machpelah, in the field of Ephron the son of Zohar the Hittite, which [is] before Mamre;<br><a name="10">10</a>  The field which Abraham purchased of the sons of Heth: there was Abraham buried, and Sarah his wife.<br><a name="11">11</a>. And it came to pass after the death of Abraham, that God blessed his son Isaac; and Isaac dwelt by the well Lahairoi.<br><a name="12">12</a>  Now these [are] the generations of Ishmael, Abraham's son, whom Hagar the Egyptian, Sarah's handmaid, bare unto Abraham:<br><a name="13">13</a>  And these [are] the names of the sons of Ishmael, by their names, according to their generations: the firstborn of Ishmael, Nebajoth; and Kedar, and Adbeel, and Mibsam,<br><a name="14">14</a>  And Mishma, and Dumah, and Massa,<br><a name="15">15</a>  Hadar, and Tema, Jetur, Naphish, and Kedemah:<br><a name="16">16</a>  These [are] the sons of Ishmael, and these [are] their names, by their towns, and by their castles; twelve princes according to their nations.<br><a name="17">17</a>  And these [are] the years of the life of Ishmael, an hundred and thirty and seven years: and he gave up the ghost and died; and was gathered unto his people.<br><a name="18">18</a>  And they dwelt from Havilah unto Shur, that [is] before Egypt, as thou goest toward Assyria: [and] he died in the presence of all his brethren.<br><a name="19">19</a>. And these [are] the generations of Isaac, Abraham's son: Abraham begat Isaac:<br><a name="20">20</a>  And Isaac was forty years old when he took Rebekah to wife, the daughter of Bethuel the Syrian of Padanaram, the sister to Laban the Syrian.<br><a name="21">21</a>  And Isaac intreated the LORD for his wife, because she [was] barren: and the LORD was intreated of him, and Rebekah his wife conceived.<br><a name="22">22</a>  And the children struggled together within her; and she said, If [it be] so, why [am] I thus? And she went to enquire of the LORD.<br><a name="23">23</a>  And the LORD said unto her, Two nations [are] in thy womb, and two manner of people shall be separated from thy bowels; and [the one] people shall be stronger than [the other] people; and the elder shall serve the younger.<br><a name="24">24</a>  And when her days to be delivered were fulfilled, behold, [there were] twins in her womb.<br><a name="25">25</a>  And the first came out red, all over like an hairy garment; and they called his name Esau.<br><a name="26">26</a>  And after that came his brother out, and his hand took hold on Esau's heel; and his name was called Jacob: and Isaac [was] threescore years old when she bare them.<br><a name="27">27</a>  And the boys grew: and Esau was a cunning hunter, a man of the field; and Jacob [was] a plain man, dwelling in tents.<br><a name="28">28</a>  And Isaac loved Esau, because he did eat of [his] venison: but Rebekah loved Jacob.<br><a name="29">29</a>. And Jacob sod pottage: and Esau came from the field, and he [was] faint:<br><a name="30">30</a>  And Esau said to Jacob, Feed me, I pray thee, with that same red [pottage]; for I [am] faint: therefore was his name called Edom.<br><a name="31">31</a>  And Jacob said, Sell me this day thy birthright.<br><a name="32">32</a>  And Esau said, Behold, I [am] at the point to die: and what profit shall this birthright do to me?<br><a name="33">33</a>  And Jacob said, Swear to me this day; and he sware unto him: and he sold his birthright unto Jacob.<br><a name="34">34</a>  Then Jacob gave Esau bread and pottage of lentiles; and he did eat and drink, and rose up, and went his way: thus Esau despised [his] birthright.<br><br>Go to <a href="gen26.htm#1">Genesis 26</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
