Song of Solomon   2<br> 1. I [am] the rose of Sharon, [and] the lily of the valleys.<br><a name="2">2</a>  As the lily among thorns, so [is] my love among the daughters.<br><a name="3">3</a>. As the apple tree among the trees of the wood, so [is] my beloved among the sons. I sat down under his shadow with great delight, and his fruit [was] sweet to my taste.<br><a name="4">4</a>  He brought me to the banqueting house, and his banner over me [was] love.<br><a name="5">5</a>  Stay me with flagons, comfort me with apples: for I [am] sick of love.<br><a name="6">6</a>  His left hand [is] under my head, and his right hand doth embrace me.<br><a name="7">7</a>  I charge you, O ye daughters of Jerusalem, by the roes, and by the hinds of the field, that ye stir not up, nor awake [my] love, till he please.<br><a name="8">8</a>. The voice of my beloved! behold, he cometh leaping upon the mountains, skipping upon the hills.<br><a name="9">9</a>  My beloved is like a roe or a young hart: behold, he standeth behind our wall, he looketh forth at the windows, shewing himself through the lattice.<br><a name="10">10</a>  My beloved spake, and said unto me, Rise up, my love, my fair one, and come away.<br><a name="11">11</a>  For, lo, the winter is past, the rain is over [and] gone;<br><a name="12">12</a>  The flowers appear on the earth; the time of the singing [of birds] is come, and the voice of the turtle is heard in our land;<br><a name="13">13</a>  The fig tree putteth forth her green figs, and the vines [with] the tender grape give a [good] smell. Arise, my love, my fair one, and come away.<br><a name="14">14</a>. O my dove, [that art] in the clefts of the rock, in the secret [places] of the stairs, let me see thy countenance, let me hear thy voice; for sweet [is] thy voice, and thy countenance [is] comely.<br><a name="15">15</a>  Take us the foxes, the little foxes, that spoil the vines: for our vines [have] tender grapes.<br><a name="16">16</a>  My beloved [is] mine, and I [am] his: he feedeth among the lilies.<br><a name="17">17</a>  Until the day break, and the shadows flee away, turn, my beloved, and be thou like a roe or a young hart upon the mountains of Bether.<br><br>Go to <a href="song3.htm#1">Song of Solomon 3</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
