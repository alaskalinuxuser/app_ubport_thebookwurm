<dl><dt><a name="1"></a>
<b><i>13:1 And I </i></b>{some MSS: 'he', ie., the dragon of <a href="rev12.htm#17">12:17</a>} <b><i>stood upon the sand of the sea,<br>
and saw a beast</i></b> {GK= therion, wild beast} <b><i>rise up out of the sea,<br>
having seven heads and ten horns,<br>
and upon his horns ten crowns, and upon his heads the name of blasphemy.</i></b></dt><dl>
<dt>the sea- Speaks of the gentile nations, the mass of humanity. cp. <a href="isa60.htm#5">Isa 60:5</a>; <a href="rev17.htm#15">Rev 17:15</a>
<dt>heads &amp; horns- The picture is confusing. But it is explained in <a href="rev17.htm#3">Rev 17:3,7,9-13</a>.<dd><ul>
<li>The 7 heads are 7 consecutive kings or kingdoms- 
<dd>Five are past, one was present at the time of writing, and one is yet to come. 
<br>The &quot;beast&quot; arises from the last.
<li>The 10 horns are 10 kings which will hold power contemporaneously (and in cooperation) with the &quot;beast&quot;.</ul>
These kings &amp; kingdoms represent the flow of gentile world power through the ages culminating in the political reign of the beast. (more at v.2)
<dt>crowns- Why were the Dragon's 7 heads crowned (<a href="rev12.htm#3">12:3</a>), while here the beast's 10 horns are crowned?
<dd>In all other points, the Dragon &amp; the beast appear identical.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are essentially the same, because the Dragon is the power behind the beast (<a href="rev13.htm#2" target="lwr_lt">v.2</a>).
<br>The difference relates to the period of time in which the successive kingdoms reign:<ul>
<li>Ch. 12 describes the historic struggle of Israel and the first coming of Christ.<br>
During that period, the 7 consecutive kingdoms were still passing.
<li>Ch. 13 brings us to the time of the end, just prior to Christ's second coming.<br>
At this time, the 10 kings will reign with the beast.</ul>
<dt>blasphemy- involves the slandering of God's Name &amp; the usurping of His place.
<dd>eg., The Caesar's deified themselves and persecuted Christians for following a 'false god' (ie., Jesus Christ).<br>Although the term 'anti-christ' is not used in Rev., it applies to the beast. &quot;Anti-&quot; has two senses: the beast rises to stand both &quot;against&quot; (opposed to) Christ, and &quot;in the place&quot; of Christ. 
<br>See <a href="1joh2.htm#18">1Joh 2:18,22</a>; <a href="1joh4.htm#1">4:1-3</a>; <a href="2joh1.htm#7">2Joh 1:7</a>; <a href="mat24.htm#23">Mat 24:23,24</a></dl><dt>
<b><i>13:2 And the beast which I saw was like unto a leopard,<br>
and his feet were as [the feet] of a bear, and his mouth as the mouth of a lion:<br>
and the dragon gave him his power, and his seat, and great authority.</i></b></dt><dl>
<dt>Daniel ch. 2, ch. 7, and this passage are parallel visions. 
<dd>Daniel saw 4 consecutive kingdoms described as beasts (lion, bear, leopard, and a dreadful / terrible beast). The last of these is the beast (of Rev. 13) which shares some of the characteristics of preceding gentile empires. (eg., Leopard- swift conquest; Bear- thorough conquest; Lion- autocratic rule). 
<br>The apparent differences between Daniel &amp; Revelation are due to the seer's perspective in time. 
<br>-- Daniel looked forward (to the future) from his time. 
<br>-- John looked back into the past (beyond Daniel) and also forward into the future time of the final beast.

<b><i>13:3 And I saw one of his heads as it were wounded to death;<br>
and his deadly wound was healed:<br>
and all the world wondered after the beast.</i></b></dt><dl>
<dt>What is this deadly wound? Several views have been suggested:<dd>[The editor favors #3. However, #1 and #3 are not mutually exclusive.]<ol type="1"></dd>
<li>The Roman empire collapsed, but it will be restored in the end times.<dd>Observe that it is one of the seven heads (the seven successive gentile kingdoms) that receives a wound &quot;as it were... unto death.&quot; Although the legacy of the Roman empire continues to influence nations today, the imperial form of government appears to be dead. Here, the imperial form is restored as the world gladly receives the beast as their emperor.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[There is no question that the beast will take the role of emperor, and that his kingdom will be a continuation of the seventh kingdom (the Roman empire). However, some of the language used, in this and related passages, seems more applicable to a person, rather than to a kingdom. eg. <a href="rev13.htm#12" target="lwr_lt">v.12,14</a>]</dd>
<li>The final world ruler will be literally killed and literally raised from the dead by Satan.<dd>Based on <a href="rev17.htm#8">17:8</a>, some see the literal resurrection of a prior Roman emperor (perhaps Nero). Others, noting that the term &quot;son of perdition&quot; occurs only in <a href="joh17.htm#12">Joh 17:12</a> and <a href="2the2.htm#3">2The 2:3</a>, think this refers to the resurrection of Judas Iscariot.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[Although the language allows for the beast's literal death, it does not require it, and may describe a near death scenario (since his deadly wound was &quot;healed&quot;). In any case, Satan does not have power to give life. He is the destroyer. Christ is the One who gives life. <a href="joh5.htm#21">Joh 5:21,25,28,29</a>]</dd>
<li>Satan will stage a counterfeit resurrection (one aspect of &quot;the lie&quot; <a href="2the2.htm#11">2The 2:11</a>).<br>
The life within the body of the slain ruler will actually be that of Satan incarnated.<ul>
<li>Although the phrase &quot;one of his heads&quot; can refer to one of the seven kingdoms, it also would refer to the king ruling at the time.
<li>The phrase &quot;as it were wounded to death&quot; is from two Greek words {hos esphagmenon}, and is identical to &quot;as it had been slain&quot; (in <a href="rev5.htm#6">5:6</a>). Both passages describe what <i>appears</i> to the viewer. The Lamb bears the marks of his historic death though He lives. The beast appears to suffer a violent death, perhaps by assassination, but continues to live.
<li>&quot;And his deadly wound was healed&quot; can be literally translated &quot;the wound of his death was healed.&quot; &quot;Healed&quot; is the GK word 'therapeuo' (cp. the English word &quot;therapeutic&quot;), meaning to cure, to restore to health.  
<li>&quot;The world wondered after the beast.&quot;- The world marvels at the beast, the reigning emperor (&quot;the man of sin&quot;, <a href="2the2.htm#3">2The 2:3-9</a>), not at his form of government. The cause of their wonder and worship (<a href="rev13.htm#4" target="lwr_lt">v.4</a>) is his apparent resurrection. From <a href="rev17.htm#8">17:8</a>, we see that the life principle that energizes the resurrected beast is the same spirit that indwelt a prior emperor, who had died prior to John's writing (&quot;who was, and is not...&quot;, eg., Nero's insanity may have been demonic possession). The spirit who arises from the abyss to indwell the beast (<a href="rev11.htm#7">11:7</a>), is Satan himself.</ul></ol>
<dt>Note the many ways that the Dragon will counterfeit Christ (in double brackets [[ ]] below)--
<dd>In this verse, we see his [[ Counterfeit Incarnation ]] and [[ Counterfeit Resurrection ]]<br>(as Satan indwells the body of the mortally wounded beast).
<dt>all the world wondered- at &quot;the beast which was, is not,and yet shall be.&quot; <a href="rev17.htm#8">Rev 17:8</a>; cf. <a href="rev1.htm#8">1:8,18</a>
<dt>all the world- is qualified in <a href="rev13.htm#8" target="lwr_lt">v.8</a> as &quot;the earth dwellers&quot; (not the saints, cp. <a href="rev11.htm#10">11:10-12</a>).</dl><dt>
<b><i>13:4 And they worshipped the dragon which gave power unto the beast:<br>

<b><i>Who [is] like unto the beast?</i></b>  {cf. <a href="ex15.htm#11">Ex 15:11</a>}<br>
<b><i>who is able to make war with him?</i></b>  {Note: There is One who is able. cp. <a href="rev19.htm#11">Rev 19:11</a>}
<dt><b><i>13:5 And there was given unto him a mouth speaking great things and blasphemies;<br>
and power </i></b>{ie., authority} <b><i>was given unto him to continue forty [and] two months.</i></b></dt><dl>
<dt>a mouth- Note again that the beast is a person. Kingdoms don't have mouths.
<dd>(Neither will kingdoms be cast alive into the Lake of Fire. <a href="rev20.htm#10">20:10</a>)
<dt>speaking great things- in arrogant boastings, 
<dd>he will declare his abilities, and make great promises which he cannot fulfill. cp. <a href="dan7.htm#8">Dan 7:8,11,25</a>
<dt>power was given- he receives his authority from the Dragon, as permitted by God.
<dd>There are six things given to him:<ol type="1"><li>The Dragon's... Power (<a href="rev13.htm#2" target="lwr_lt">v.2</a>),<li>The Dragon's...

<dt>42 months- The last half of the Tribulation period.
<dd>This false christ will have the same length of time as Jesus' earthly ministry.</dl><dt>
<b><i>13:6 And he opened his mouth in blasphemy against God,</i></b>
<dd>- As anti-christ, he is also anti-God.<dt>
<b><i>to blaspheme his name, and his tabernacle, </i></b>
<dd>- He usurps the Temple, the place of God's Name. cp. <a href="2the2.htm#4">2Thes 2:4</a>; with  <a href="isa14.htm#13">Isa 14:13</a>; <a href="eze28.htm#14">Eze 28:14,16</a>; <a href="eze20.htm#40">20:40</a><dt>
<dd>...tabernacle {ie., tent}- Although intended as a permanent structure, the Tribulation Temple will not be long standing.
<dt><b><i>and them that dwell </i></b>{ie., tabernacle, dwell temporarily} <b><i>in heaven.</i></b>
<dd>- He slanders the saints in heaven, who will one day rule with Christ on earth.
<br>- He slaughters the saints on earth:<dt>
<b><i>13:7 And it was given unto him to make war with the saints, and to overcome them:</i></b>
<dd><a href="dan7.htm#21">Dan 7:21,25</a>; <a href="rev11.htm#7">Rev 11:7</a><dt>
<b><i>and power was given him over all kindreds, and tongues, and nations.</i></b></dt><dl>
<dt>power... over<i> all...</i>- The beast is universal dictator.
<dd>Therefore, any conflict between kings during the end times must be prior to this. [JBSmith]<br>(cp. <a href="dan7.htm#7">Dan 7:7-8,24</a>; <a href="dan11.htm#40">11:40-44</a>)<br>The beast is the political head of the world, as is Satan (cp. <a href="joh12.htm#31">Joh 12:31</a>; <a href="joh14.htm#30">14:30</a>; <a href="joh16.htm#11">16:11</a>).</dl><dt>
<b><i>13:8 And all that dwell upon the earth shall worship him,</i></b>
<dd>The beast is also the religious head of the world (cp. <a href="2cor4.htm#4">2Cor 4:4</a>).<dt>
<b><i>whose names are not written in the book of life<br>
of the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world.</i></b></dt><dl>
<dt>the Lamb slain- Only those redeemed by His blood are included in His book.
<dt>the foundation of the world- Speaks of its beginning. 
<dd>Even before man sinned, the Lamb was provided. Salvation would come through the seed of the woman. Satan's end would come through Him. <a href="gen3.htm#15">Gen 3:15,21</a>; <a href="heb4.htm#3">Heb 4:3</a></dl><dt>
<b><i>13:9 If any man have an ear, let him hear.</i></b></dt><dl>
<dt>This exhortation is given at the end of each of the letters to the 7 churches (in ch. 2 &amp; 3).
<dd>Note that, here, the phrase &quot;what the spirit says to the churches&quot; is missing, because the Church has been raptured. Yet, salvation through the blood of the Lamb is still available. The question remains: What will you do with Jesus? Which &quot;Christ&quot; will you serve?</dl><dt>
<b><i>13:10 He that leadeth into captivity shall go into captivity:<br>
he that killeth with the sword must be killed with the sword.<br>
Here is the patience and the faith of the saints.</i></b></dt><dl>
<dt>This is a dual warning:<ul>
<li>To the oppressor of the saints, that he will be held accountable.<dd>cp. <a href="gen9.htm#6">Gen 9:6</a>; <a href="gal6.htm#7">Gal 6:7</a></dd>
<li>To the oppressed saints, not to take revenge, but to flee the enemy.<dd>cp. <a href="rom12.htm#19">Rom 12:19</a>; <a href="mat5.htm#38">Mat 5:38,39</a>; <a href="mat10.htm#23">10:23</a>; <a href="mat26.htm#52">26:52</a></dd></ul>

<b><i>13:11 And I beheld another</i></b> {GK= allos, another of the same sort} <b><i>beast <br>coming up out of the earth;</i></b>
<dd>the earth- This beast rises out of the land (ie., the land of Israel).<dt>
<b><i>and he had two horns like a lamb, and he spake as a dragon.</i></b>
<dd>This beast is also a counterfeit christ. He is a dragon in sheep's clothing. cf. <a href="joh10.htm#10">Joh 10:10</a><dt>
<b><i>13:12 And he exerciseth all the power</i></b> {authority} <b><i>of the first beast before him,</i></b></dt><dl>
<dt>before him- GK= enopion, in his sight. ie., with his approval.
<dt>[[ Counterfeit trinity ]]-<ul>
<li>The Dragon, who gives his authority to the beasts.
<li>The Beast out of the sea, a king of kings (cf. <a href="1tim6.htm#13">1Tim 6:13-16</a>).
<li>The Beast out of the land, the false prophet, who does not speak of himself,<dd> but of the first beast. cp. <a href="rev16.htm#13">Rev 16:13</a>; <a href="rev19.htm#20">19:20</a>; <a href="rev20.htm#10">20:10</a> (cf. <a href="joh16.htm#13">Joh 16:13-15</a>)</ul></dl><dt>
<b><i>and causeth the earth and them which dwell therein to worship the first beast,<br>
whose deadly wound was healed.</i></b></dt><dl>
<dt>Recall that Beast #1 is the political &amp; religious head of the world.
<dd>Beast #2 is the false prophet, whose primary purpose is to direct worship toward Beast #1 because of his &quot;resurrection.&quot;
<dt>These two beasts are the final fulfilment of Jesus' warning regarding
<dd>false christs &amp; false prophets. <a href="mat24.htm#24">Mat 24:24,25</a></dl><dt>

<dt>[[ Counterfeit Miracles ]]- The 2nd beast exercizes power like that of Elijah
<dd>or like the Two Witnesses (cp. <a href="rev11.htm#3">11:3-6</a>), in the same way that the Egyptian magicians imitated some of Moses' plagues (eg., <a href="ex7.htm#11">Ex 7:11,12</a>; <a href="2tim3.htm#8">2Tim 3:8</a>).<br>These signs give credence to the false message.

<b><i>13:14 And deceiveth them that dwell on the earth by [the means of]<br>

<dd>cp. <a href="2the2.htm#8">2Thes 2:8-12</a>
<dt>he had power to do- lit., &quot;it was given him to do.&quot;
<dd>The enabling force behind the activity of this beast is the Dragon (who also empowers the first beast).</dl><dt>
<b><i>saying to them that dwell on the earth, that they should make an image<br>
to the beast, which had the wound by a sword, and did live.</i></b></dt><dl>
<dt>saying...- [[ Counterfeit Message ]] This is <i>the gospel of the antichrist</i>.
<dt>an image to the beast- not merely &quot;of&quot; him, but to his honor, for his benefit.
<dt>which had the wound by the sword, and did live.- Note the subtle change in description.
<dd>In <a href="rev13.htm#3" target="lwr_lt">v.3</a>, <a href="rev13.htm#12" target="lwr_lt">v.12</a>, the one wounded &quot;was healed&quot; (GK= therapeuo). 
<dd>Here, the one wounded &quot;did live&quot; (GK= ezasen, an unusual form of &quot;zao&quot;, to live.)<br>This word is used elsewhere of Jesus (<a href="rev2.htm#8">2:8</a>). (cp. <a href="act17.htm#29">Acts 17:29-31</a>; <a href="rom1.htm#3">Rom 1:3,4</a>) <br>The false prophet uses the term to undermine the uniqueness of Jesus' resurrection. The &quot;healing&quot; of the beast is advertised as a return from death to life.
<dt>that they should make an image...- 
<dd>To honor himself, Nebuchadnezzar made an image and commanded all to worship it, on penalty of death (<a href="dan3.htm#1">Dan 3:1-7</a>). Nebuchadnezzar's image was a great statue. Therefore, the assumption has been that the beast's image would take a similar, but technologically advanced form, and be located in Jerusalem. However, the text does not require this form or location. Consider...
<ul><li>make {GK= poieo} - Although this word can mean &quot;to construct,&quot; it has many other senses, including: to perform, cause, do, acquire. Examples: <a href="rev13.htm#13" target="lwr_lt">13:13</a> (doeth, maketh); v.14 (to do); v.15 (cause); <a href="luk19.htm#18">Luk 19:18</a> (gained).
<li>that they should make...- The task of &quot;making&quot; this image does not fall to a small group of craftsmen, as we might expect, if the image was a mechanized statue. Rather, &quot;them that dwell upon the earth&quot; (ie., the citizens of the world) are given this responsibility. Perhaps, everyone will be required to &quot;acquire&quot; the beast's image daily, by signing in to an official website, or with a cellphone app, to affirm their allegiance to him.</ul></dl><dt>
<b><i>13:15 And he had power to give life unto the image of the beast,<br>
that the image of the beast should both speak, and cause<br>
that as many as would not worship the image of the beast should be killed.</i></b></dt><dl>
<dt>he had power to...- lit., it was given him to...
<dt>image- GK= eikon, likeness.
<dt>image of the beast- Here is another indication that the beast is a person
<dd>rather than a kingdom. What could constitute an image of an empire?
<dt>life- GK= pneuma, breath, wind, spirit. This word occurs 385 times in the NT.<dd>This is the only occurrence where it is translated &quot;life.&quot;
<br>The image apparently lacks life (GK, zoe) and soul (GK, psuche), but nevertheless is animated and has certain powers (perhaps a combination of electronics and the demonic). <dt>speak- The idols of antiquity could not speak, see, hear, act... <a href="psa115.htm#2">Psa 115:2-9</a>
<dd>But today's computers do all of these. Often, the human to computer interface is image based (eg., &quot;click on the icon...&quot;). Perhaps through the internet, the beast will appear to interact personally with each of his subjects, answering their questions, receiving their reports, etc.
<dt>cause that [they] be killed-  cp. <a href="mat10.htm#36">Mat 10:36</a><dd>This is the Dragon's purpose: to destroy all who serve the true God. <br>Because God has limited his time, his purpose will not be fully accomplished (<a href="mat24.htm#22">Mat 24:22</a>).</dl><dt>
<b><i>13:16 And he causeth all, both small and great, rich and poor,<br>
free and bond, to receive a mark in their right hand, or in their foreheads:</i></b></dt><dl>
<dt>all- These six categories include the extremes of society, emphasizing universality.
<dt>mark- GK= charagma, mark, stamp, a thing graven.<dd>It signifies ownership, as a brand identifies a slave or animal as belonging to its master.
<dt>to receive a mark...- &quot;Receive&quot; is the GK word &quot;didomai,&quot;<dd>which is almost always (365x out of 413x) translated &quot;to give.&quot; This is the only place where it is translated &quot;receive.&quot; (Of the ten occurrences in Rev 13 alone, the word is translated &quot;to give&quot; seven times. In two places, the KJV reading &quot;he had power&quot; is literally &quot;power was given to him&quot;.) Therefore, in the margin of many Bibles, this alternate reading is suggested: &quot;Causeth... to give (them) a mark...&quot; In <a href="rev14.htm#9">Rev 14:9</a>, the word &quot;receive&quot; is GK= lambano (to receive). So, there is no question that each person will be pressured to receive the mark. However, here the sense may be that in order to participate in commerce, a person must give (or present) his mark of identification with the system.</dl><dt>
<b><i>13:17 And that no man might buy or sell, save he that had the mark,<br>
or</i></b> {ie., either} <b><i>the name of the beast, or the number of his name.</i></b></dt><dl>
<dt>name- Again, identity with (or) ownership by the beast is in view.
<dt>no man might buy or sell- Those who refuse to worship/serve the beast, 
<dd>will be cut out of the economic system &amp; denied the ability to make a living.
<br>Everyone must weigh the costs: cp. <a href="rev14.htm#9">Rev 14:9,10</a>; <a href="rev20.htm#4">20:4</a>; <a href="mat4.htm#8">Mat 4:8-10</a>; <a href="mat10.htm#32">10:32-39</a></dl><dt>
<b><i>13:18 Here is</i></b> {the} <b><i>wisdom.</i></b>
<dd><a href="dan2.htm#20">Dan 2:20-23,30</a>; <a href="dan12.htm#10">12:10</a>; <a href="1cor2.htm#13">1Cor 2:13</a><dt>
<b><i>Let him that hath understanding count the number of the beast:</i></b></dt><dl>
<dt>let him count- (ie., calculate, reckon with figures)
<dd>Since this is in the imperative (a command), attempts to calculate the beast's name should not be quickly disregarded. Yet, they must be considered with caution to avoid mere presumption.
<dt>number- GK= arithmos</dl><dt>
<b><i>for it is the number of a man;<br>
and his number [is] Six hundred threescore [and] six.</i></b></dt><dl>
<dt>In some MSS (including the Textus Receptus) this number is represented<dd>by three Greek characters <b>&chi; &xi; &sigmaf;</b> (chi, xi, sigma) and could be represented as &quot;666&quot; (the three characters bearing their respective values in the Greek numeric system: six hundred, sixty, six). In other MSS, the number is written out with words as &quot;Six hundred, Sixty, Six&quot; (hexakosioi hexekonta hex).
<dt>666- May suggest the unholy trinity. 
<dd>The number &quot;six&quot; is often associated with man, man's work or man's glory (eg. <a href="ex20.htm#9">Ex 20:9,10</a>; <a href="lev25.htm#3">Lev 25:3,4</a>; <a href="deu5.htm#13">Deu 5:13,14</a>; <a href="dan3.htm#1">Dan 3:1</a>; <a href="1sam17.htm#4">1Sam 17:4</a>). Man, made in the image of God, falls short of God's perfection.
<dd>The Holy Trinity consists of 3 Perfect Persons (and could be shown as 777).
<dt>The letters of ancient alphabets (including Hebrew &amp; Greek) also served as
<dd>the number symbols. Sometimes, the numeric values were assigned according to the order in the alphabet (eg., a=1, b=2, etc.). Sometimes, specific characters had generally accepted numeric value (eg., Roman numerals).
<dd>By adding the numeric values of the letters in a name, its number could be calculated. In the course of the Church Age, various men have been speculatively identified as the beast in this way (including Caesar Nero, Hitler and others). Evidently the man of sin has not yet been revealed. His identity will be clear to &quot;the wise&quot; of that day.
<dt>Because this number is required for economic participation (<a href="rev13.htm#17" target="lwr_lt">v.17</a>), 
<dd>it may take the form of a computer identity system (eg., imprinted barcode, implanted microchip, etc.). In our day of electronic banking, credit cards, and computer databases of personal information, it is not hard to imagine how a malicious dictator could establish his total economic control over the world, while convincing its citizens that the action was necessary for their peace and security (eg., to combat banking fraud, identity theft, and terrorism).
<dt>But who will you serve? - <a href="josh24.htm#15">Josh 24:15</a>; <a href="1kin18.htm#21">1Kin 18:21</a>; <a href="joh6.htm#67">Joh 6:67-69</a>
