Proverbs   8<br> 1. Doth not wisdom cry? and understanding put forth her voice?<br><a name="2">2</a>  She standeth in the top of high places, by the way in the places of the paths.<br><a name="3">3</a>  She crieth at the gates, at the entry of the city, at the coming in at the doors.<br><a name="4">4</a>  Unto you, O men, I call; and my voice [is] to the sons of man.<br><a name="5">5</a>  O ye simple, understand wisdom: and, ye fools, be ye of an understanding heart.<br><a name="6">6</a>  Hear; for I will speak of excellent things; and the opening of my lips [shall be] right things.<br><a name="7">7</a>  For my mouth shall speak truth; and wickedness [is] an abomination to my lips.<br><a name="8">8</a>  All the words of my mouth [are] in righteousness; [there is] nothing froward or perverse in them.<br><a name="9">9</a>  They [are] all plain to him that understandeth, and right to them that find knowledge.<br><a name="10">10</a>  Receive my instruction, and not silver; and knowledge rather than choice gold.<br><a name="11">11</a>  For wisdom [is] better than rubies; and all the things that may be desired are not to be compared to it.<br><a name="12">12</a>. I wisdom dwell with prudence, and find out knowledge of witty inventions.<br><a name="13">13</a>  The fear of the LORD [is] to hate evil: pride, and arrogancy, and the evil way, and the froward mouth, do I hate.<br><a name="14">14</a>  Counsel [is] mine, and sound wisdom: I [am] understanding; I have strength.<br><a name="15">15</a>  By me kings reign, and princes decree justice.<br><a name="16">16</a>  By me princes rule, and nobles, [even] all the judges of the earth.<br><a name="17">17</a>  I love them that love me; and those that seek me early shall find me.<br><a name="18">18</a>  Riches and honour [are] with me; [yea], durable riches and righteousness.<br><a name="19">19</a>  My fruit [is] better than gold, yea, than fine gold; and my revenue than choice silver.<br><a name="20">20</a>  I lead in the way of righteousness, in the midst of the paths of judgment:<br><a name="21">21</a>  That I may cause those that love me to inherit substance; and I will fill their treasures.<br><a name="22">22</a>. The LORD possessed me in the beginning of his way, before his works of old.<br><a name="23">23</a>  I was set up from everlasting, from the beginning, or ever the earth was.<br><a name="24">24</a>  When [there were] no depths, I was brought forth; when [there were] no fountains abounding with water.<br><a name="25">25</a>  Before the mountains were settled, before the hills was I brought forth:<br><a name="26">26</a>  While as yet he had not made the earth, nor the fields, nor the highest part of the dust of the world.<br><a name="27">27</a>  When he prepared the heavens, I [was] there: when he set a compass upon the face of the depth:<br><a name="28">28</a>  When he established the clouds above: when he strengthened the fountains of the deep:<br><a name="29">29</a>  When he gave to the sea his decree, that the waters should not pass his commandment: when he appointed the foundations of the earth:<br><a name="30">30</a>  Then I was by him, [as] one brought up [with him]: and I was daily [his] delight, rejoicing always before him;<br><a name="31">31</a>  Rejoicing in the habitable part of his earth; and my delights [were] with the sons of men.<br><a name="32">32</a>. Now therefore hearken unto me, O ye children: for blessed [are they that] keep my ways.<br><a name="33">33</a>  Hear instruction, and be wise, and refuse it not.<br><a name="34">34</a>  Blessed [is] the man that heareth me, watching daily at my gates, waiting at the posts of my doors.<br><a name="35">35</a>  For whoso findeth me findeth life, and shall obtain favour of the LORD.<br><a name="36">36</a>  But he that sinneth against me wrongeth his own soul: all they that hate me love death.<br><br>Go to <a href="pro9.htm#1">Proverbs 9</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
