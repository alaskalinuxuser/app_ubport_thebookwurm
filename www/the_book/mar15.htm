Mark  15<br> 1. And straightway in the morning the chief priests held a consultation with the elders and scribes and the whole council, and bound Jesus, and carried [him] away, and delivered [him] to Pilate.<br><a name="2">2</a>  And Pilate asked him, Art thou the King of the Jews? And he answering said unto him, Thou sayest [it].<br><a name="3">3</a>  And the chief priests accused him of many things: but he answered nothing.<br><a name="4">4</a>  And Pilate asked him again, saying, Answerest thou nothing? behold how many things they witness against thee.<br><a name="5">5</a>  But Jesus yet answered nothing; so that Pilate marvelled.<br><a name="6">6</a>  Now at [that] feast he released unto them one prisoner, whomsoever they desired.<br><a name="7">7</a>  And there was [one] named Barabbas, [which lay] bound with them that had made insurrection with him, who had committed murder in the insurrection.<br><a name="8">8</a>  And the multitude crying aloud began to desire [him to do] as he had ever done unto them.<br><a name="9">9</a>  But Pilate answered them, saying, Will ye that I release unto you the King of the Jews?<br><a name="10">10</a>  For he knew that the chief priests had delivered him for envy.<br><a name="11">11</a>  But the chief priests moved the people, that he should rather release Barabbas unto them.<br><a name="12">12</a>  And Pilate answered and said again unto them, What will ye then that I shall do [unto him] whom ye call the King of the Jews?<br><a name="13">13</a>  And they cried out again, Crucify him.<br><a name="14">14</a>  Then Pilate said unto them, Why, what evil hath he done? And they cried out the more exceedingly, Crucify him.<br><a name="15">15</a>. And [so] Pilate, willing to content the people, released Barabbas unto them, and delivered Jesus, when he had scourged [him], to be crucified.<br><a name="16">16</a>  And the soldiers led him away into the hall, called Praetorium; and they call together the whole band.<br><a name="17">17</a>  And they clothed him with purple, and platted a crown of thorns, and put it about his [head],<br><a name="18">18</a>  And began to salute him, Hail, King of the Jews!<br><a name="19">19</a>  And they smote him on the head with a reed, and did spit upon him, and bowing [their] knees worshipped him.<br><a name="20">20</a>  And when they had mocked him, they took off the purple from him, and put his own clothes on him, and led him out to crucify him.<br><a name="21">21</a>  And they compel one Simon a Cyrenian, who passed by, coming out of the country, the father of Alexander and Rufus, to bear his cross.<br><a name="22">22</a>. And they bring him unto the place Golgotha, which is, being interpreted, The place of a skull.<br><a name="23">23</a>  And they gave him to drink wine mingled with myrrh: but he received [it] not.<br><a name="24">24</a>  And when they had crucified him, they parted his garments, casting lots upon them, what every man should take.<br><a name="25">25</a>  And it was the third hour, and they crucified him.<br><a name="26">26</a>  And the superscription of his accusation was written over, THE KING OF THE JEWS.<br><a name="27">27</a>  And with him they crucify two thieves; the one on his right hand, and the other on his left.<br><a name="28">28</a>  And the scripture was fulfilled, which saith, And he was numbered with the transgressors.<br><a name="29">29</a>  And they that passed by railed on him, wagging their heads, and saying, Ah, thou that destroyest the temple, and buildest [it] in three days,<br><a name="30">30</a>  Save thyself, and come down from the cross.<br><a name="31">31</a>  Likewise also the chief priests mocking said among themselves with the scribes, He saved others; himself he cannot save.<br><a name="32">32</a>  Let Christ the King of Israel descend now from the cross, that we may see and believe. And they that were crucified with him reviled him.<br><a name="33">33</a>. And when the sixth hour was come, there was darkness over the whole land until the ninth hour.<br><a name="34">34</a>  And at the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying, Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani? which is, being interpreted, My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?<br><a name="35">35</a>  And some of them that stood by, when they heard [it], said, Behold, he calleth Elias.<br><a name="36">36</a>  And one ran and filled a spunge full of vinegar, and put [it] on a reed, and gave him to drink, saying, Let alone; let us see whether Elias will come to take him down.<br><a name="37">37</a>  And Jesus cried with a loud voice, and gave up the ghost.<br><a name="38">38</a>  And the veil of the temple was rent in twain from the top to the bottom.<br><a name="39">39</a>  And when the centurion, which stood over against him, saw that he so cried out, and gave up the ghost, he said, Truly this man was the Son of God.<br><a name="40">40</a>  There were also women looking on afar off: among whom was Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James the less and of Joses, and Salome;<br><a name="41">41</a>  (Who also, when he was in Galilee, followed him, and ministered unto him;) and many other women which came up with him unto Jerusalem.<br><a name="42">42</a>. And now when the even was come, because it was the preparation, that is, the day before the sabbath,<br><a name="43">43</a>  Joseph of Arimathaea, an honourable counsellor, which also waited for the kingdom of God, came, and went in boldly unto Pilate, and craved the body of Jesus.<br><a name="44">44</a>  And Pilate marvelled if he were already dead: and calling [unto him] the centurion, he asked him whether he had been any while dead.<br><a name="45">45</a>  And when he knew [it] of the centurion, he gave the body to Joseph.<br><a name="46">46</a>  And he bought fine linen, and took him down, and wrapped him in the linen, and laid him in a sepulchre which was hewn out of a rock, and rolled a stone unto the door of the sepulchre.<br><a name="47">47</a>  And Mary Magdalene and Mary [the mother] of Joses beheld where he was laid.<br><br>Go to <a href="mar16.htm#1">Mark 16</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
