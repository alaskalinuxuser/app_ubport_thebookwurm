<dt><b><i>13:1 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,<br>
13:2 Sanctify </b></i>{HB=qadash, set apart, dedicate}<i><b> unto me all the firstborn,<br>whatsoever </b></i>{first}<i><b> openeth the womb among the children of Israel, [both] of man and of beast:<br>it [is] mine.</i></b></dt><dl>
<dt>[ The sanctification of the first-born will be discussed following v.11-16. ]
</dl><dt>
<b><i>13:3 And Moses said unto the people,<br>Remember this day, in which ye came out from Egypt, out of the house of bondage;<br>for by strength of hand the LORD brought you out from this [place]:<br>there shall no leavened bread be eaten.<br>
13:4 This day came ye out in the month Abib. </b></i>{cp. <a href="ex12.htm#2">12:2</a>, usually corresponds with April.}<i><b><br>
13:5 And it shall be when the LORD shall bring thee into the land of the Canaanites,<br>and the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites,<br>which he sware unto thy fathers to give thee, a land flowing with milk and honey,<br>that thou shalt keep this service in this month.<br>
13:6 Seven days thou shalt eat unleavened bread,<br>and in the seventh day [shall be] a feast to the LORD.<br>
13:7 Unleavened bread shall be eaten seven days;<br>and there shall no leavened bread be seen with thee,<br>neither shall there be leaven seen with thee in all thy quarters.<br>
13:8 And thou shalt shew thy son in that day, saying,<br>[This is done] because of that [which] the LORD did unto me when I came forth out of Egypt.<br>
13:9 And it shall be for a sign unto thee upon thine hand, and for a memorial between thine eyes,<br>that the LORD'S law may be in thy mouth: </b></i>{cp. <a href="deu6.htm#6">Deu 6:6-8</a>}<i><b><br>for with a strong hand hath the LORD brought thee out of Egypt.<br>
13:10 Thou shalt therefore keep this ordinance in his season from year to year.</i></b></dt><dl>
<dt>The Feast of Unleavened Bread was discussed at length in the previous chapter (<a href="ex12.htm#14">12:14-21</a>).
<dd>Why is this instruction repeated here, in the context of the command to 'sanctify the first-born'?
<dd>The repetition...<ul>
<li>Emphasized the importance of remembering that it was the LORD who delivered them.
<li>Emphasized the need to remain cleansed from all corrupting influences (as symbolized by leaven).
<li>Established this feast as a remembrance in perpetuity, not to be neglected after their deliverance was complete (<a href="ex13.htm#5" target="lwr_lt">v.5</a>).
<li>Established this feast as a tool for teaching the next generation concerning the LORD's deliverance (<a href="ex13.htm#8" target="lwr_lt">v.8</a>, <a href="ex13.htm#14" target="lwr_lt">v.14,15</a>; <a href="ex12.htm#26">12:26,27</a>). 
<li>Emphasized the link between the <i>deliverance</i> of the nation and the <i>death</i> of the first-born.</ul></dl><dt>
<b><i>13:11 And it shall be when the LORD shall bring thee into the land of the Canaanites,<br>as he sware unto thee and to thy fathers, and shall give it thee,<br>
13:12 That thou shalt set apart unto the LORD all that </b></i>{first}<i><b> openeth the matrix </b></i>{ie., womb}<i><b>,<br>and every firstling that cometh of a beast which thou hast; the males [shall be] the LORD'S.<br>
13:13 And every firstling of an ass thou shalt redeem with a lamb;<br>and if thou wilt not redeem it, then thou shalt break his neck:<br>and all the firstborn of man among thy children shalt thou redeem.<br>
13:14 And it shall be when thy son asketh thee in time to come, saying, What [is] this?<br>that thou shalt say unto him,<br>By strength of hand the LORD brought us out from Egypt, from the house of bondage:<br>
13:15 And it came to pass, when Pharaoh would hardly let us go,<br>that the LORD slew all the firstborn in the land of Egypt,<br>both the firstborn of man, and the firstborn of beast:<br>therefore I sacrifice to the LORD all that </b></i>{first}<i><b> openeth the matrix </b></i>{ie., womb}<i><b>, being males;<br>but all the firstborn of my children I redeem.<br>
13:16 And it shall be for a token upon thine hand, and for frontlets between thine eyes:<br>for by strength of hand the LORD brought us forth out of Egypt.</i></b></dt><dl>
<dt>Sanctify unto Me all the first-born... (<a href="ex13.htm#2" target="lwr_lt">v.2</a>) -<ul>
<li>The first born of clean animals were to be offered to the LORD upon the altar (<a href="ex13.htm#12" target="lwr_lt">v.12</a>)
<li>The first born of unclean animals (eg., an ass), and of men were to be sanctified {ie., set apart as belonging to the LORD} by means of a substitutionary sacrifice of clean animals (<a href="ex13.htm#13" target="lwr_lt">v.13</a>).
<li>The ultimate sacrifice, by which men are truly sanctified, was Himself set apart for God's purpose, in compliance with these instructions.
<dd>cp. <a href="luk2.htm#21">Luk 2:21-24</a> (which quotes <a href="ex13.htm#12" target="lwr_lt">Ex 13:12</a>, <a href="num8.htm#17">Num 8:17</a>, and <a href="lev12.htm#8">Lev 12:8</a>)</dd>
<dd>Jesus, the first-born of Mary, and the only-begotten of the Father (<a href="joh1.htm#14">Joh 1:14</a>),</dd><dd>became the &quot;first begotten&quot; from among the dead (<a href="rev1.htm#5">Rev 1:5</a>).</dd></ul>
<dt>the firstling of an ass... the firstborn of man...-
<dd>&quot;Man is unclean and must be redeemed.<br>Unredeemed, his value equals an ass with a broken neck.<br>Redeemed, he is worth as much as the blood of the Lamb.&quot; [CHM]
<dt>it shall be for a token... and for frontlets between thine eyes...- cp. <a href="ex13.htm#9" target="lwr_lt">v.9</a>; <a href="deu6.htm#7">Deu 6:7-9</a>
<dd>Again, there is opportunity and responsibility for teaching the next generation.
<dd>The intent is that the truths, taught by the Feast of Unleavened Bread and by the Sanctification of the First-Born, are to be continually on the hearts and tongues of God's people.<br>&quot;...the LORD brought us forth out of Egypt.&quot;
</dl><dt>
<b><i>13:17 And it came to pass, when Pharaoh had let the people go,<br>that God led them not [through] the way of the land of the Philistines, although that [was] near;<br>for God said, Lest peradventure the people repent when they see war, and they return to Egypt:<br>
13:18 But God led the people about, [through] the way of the wilderness of the Red sea:<br>and the children of Israel went up harnessed </b></i>{ie., orderly}<i><b> out of the land of Egypt.<br>
13:19 And Moses took the bones of Joseph with him:<br>for he had straitly sworn the children of Israel, saying,<br>God will surely visit you; and ye shall carry up my bones away hence with you.</i></b> {<a href="gen50.htm#24">Gen 50:24-26</a>}</dt><dl>
<dt>Joseph's bones- When Joseph died, he was buried as a national hero in Egypt.
<dd>By now, Egypt had forgotten him (<a href="ex1.htm#8">Ex 1:8</a>). No one protests the removal of his bones.<br>
But his bones bore testimony to the faithfulness of God, who would not forget His promises.
<dt>God purposely led the people on a long route to Canaan, although there was a shorter route available (<a href="ex13.htm#17" target="lwr_lt">v.17,18</a>).
<dd>He chose the longer path to teach them...<ul><li>who He is,<li>what they were (ie., flesh, unbelief and rebellion).<li>They would not be ready for battle until then. cp. <a href="psa103.htm#14">Psa 103:14</a>; <a href="deu8.htm#2">Deu 8:2-5</a></ul></dl><dt>
<b><i>13:20 And they took their journey from Succoth, and encamped in Etham, in the edge of the wilderness.<br>
13:21 And the LORD went before them by day in a pillar of a cloud, to lead them the way;<br>and by night in a pillar of fire, to give them light; to go by day and night:<br>
13:22 He took not away the pillar of the cloud by day,<br>nor the pillar of fire by night, [from] before the people.</i></b></dt><dl>
<dt>From the perspective of the people, the way was unknown, uncertain and full of dangers.
<dt>But the LORD had guaranteed their destination (<a href="ex3.htm#17">Ex 3:17</a>; <a href="ex6.htm#6">6:6-8</a>). 
<dd>He, knowing the best way, and anticipating their difficulties and limitations (<a href="ex13.htm#17" target="lwr_lt">v.17,18</a>),<br>would lead them. He was going with them. cp. <a href="ex33.htm#14">Ex 33:14,15</a>; <a href="psa23.htm#4">Psa 23:4</a>; <a href="isa43.htm#1">Isa 43:1-3</a></dl></dl>
