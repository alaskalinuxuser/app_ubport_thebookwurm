Jonah   4<br>1. But it displeased Jonah exceedingly, and he was very angry.<br><a name="2">2</a>  And he prayed unto the LORD, and said, I pray thee, O LORD, [was] not this my saying, when I was yet in my country? Therefore I fled before unto Tarshish: for I knew that thou [art] a gracious God, and merciful, slow to anger, and of great kindness, and repentest thee of the evil.<br><a name="3">3</a>  Therefore now, O LORD, take, I beseech thee, my life from me; for [it is] better for me to die than to live.<br><a name="4">4</a>  Then said the LORD, Doest thou well to be angry?<br><a name="5">5</a>.
