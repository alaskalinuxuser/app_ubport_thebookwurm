Hebrews   6<br> 1. Therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ, let us go on unto perfection; not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works, and of faith toward God,<br><a name="2">2</a>  Of the doctrine of baptisms, and of laying on of hands, and of resurrection of the dead, and of eternal judgment.<br><a name="3">3</a>  And this will we do, if God permit.<br><a name="4">4</a>  For [it is] impossible for those who were once enlightened, and have tasted of the heavenly gift, and were made partakers of the Holy Ghost,<br><a name="5">5</a>  And have tasted the good word of God, and the powers of the world to come,<br><a name="6">6</a>  If they shall fall away, to renew them again unto repentance; seeing they crucify to themselves the Son of God afresh, and put [him] to an open shame.<br><a name="7">7</a>  For the earth which drinketh in the rain that cometh oft upon it, and bringeth forth herbs meet for them by whom it is dressed, receiveth blessing from God:<br><a name="8">8</a>  But that which beareth thorns and briers [is] rejected, and [is] nigh unto cursing; whose end [is] to be burned.<br><a name="9">9</a>. But, beloved, we are persuaded better things of you, and things that accompany salvation, though we thus speak.<br><a name="10">10</a>  For God [is] not unrighteous to forget your work and labour of love, which ye have shewed toward his name, in that ye have ministered to the saints, and do minister.<br><a name="11">11</a>  And we desire that every one of you do shew the same diligence to the full assurance of hope unto the end:<br><a name="12">12</a>  That ye be not slothful, but followers of them who through faith and patience inherit the promises.<br><a name="13">13</a>  For when God made promise to Abraham, because he could swear by no greater, he sware by himself,<br><a name="14">14</a>  Saying, Surely blessing I will bless thee, and multiplying I will multiply thee.<br><a name="15">15</a>  And so, after he had patiently endured, he obtained the promise.<br><a name="16">16</a>  For men verily swear by the greater: and an oath for confirmation [is] to them an end of all strife.<br><a name="17">17</a>  Wherein God, willing more abundantly to shew unto the heirs of promise the immutability of his counsel, confirmed [it] by an oath:<br><a name="18">18</a>  That by two immutable things, in which [it was] impossible for God to lie, we might have a strong consolation, who have fled for refuge to lay hold upon the hope set before us:<br><a name="19">19</a>  Which [hope] we have as an anchor of the soul, both sure and stedfast, and which entereth into that within the veil;<br><a name="20">20</a>  Whither the forerunner is for us entered, [even] Jesus, made an high priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec.<br><br>Go to <a href="heb7.htm#1">Hebrews 7</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
