Psalms 104<br>1. Bless the LORD, O my soul. O LORD my God, thou art very great; thou art clothed with honour and majesty.<br><a name="2">2</a>  Who coverest [thyself] with light as [with] a garment: who stretchest out the heavens like a curtain:<br><a name="3">3</a>  Who layeth the beams of his chambers in the waters: who maketh the clouds his chariot: who walketh upon the wings of the wind:<br><a name="4">4</a>  Who maketh his angels spirits; his ministers a flaming fire:<br><a name="5">5</a>  [Who] laid the foundations of the earth, [that] it should not be removed for ever.<br><a name="6">6</a>  Thou coveredst it with the deep as [with] a garment: the waters stood above the mountains.<br><a name="7">7</a>  At thy rebuke they fled; at the voice of thy thunder they hasted away.<br><a name="8">8</a>  They go up by the mountains; they go down by the valleys unto the place which thou hast founded for them.<br><a name="9">9</a>  Thou hast set a bound that they may not pass over; that they turn not again to cover the earth.<br><a name="10">10</a>. He sendeth the springs into the valleys, [which] run among the hills.<br><a name="11">11</a>  They give drink to every beast of the field: the wild asses quench their thirst.<br><a name="12">12</a>  By them shall the fowls of the heaven have their habitation, [which] sing among the branches.<br><a name="13">13</a>  He watereth the hills from his chambers: the earth is satisfied with the fruit of thy works.<br><a name="14">14</a>  He causeth the grass to grow for the cattle, and herb for the service of man: that he may bring forth food out of the earth;<br><a name="15">15</a>  And wine [that] maketh glad the heart of man, [and] oil to make [his] face to shine, and bread [which] strengtheneth man's heart.<br><a name="16">16</a>  The trees of the LORD are full [of sap]; the cedars of Lebanon, which he hath planted;<br><a name="17">17</a>  Where the birds make their nests: [as for] the stork, the fir trees [are] her house.<br><a name="18">18</a>  The high hills [are] a refuge for the wild goats; [and] the rocks for the conies.<br><a name="19">19</a>. He appointed the moon for seasons: the sun knoweth his going down.<br><a name="20">20</a>  Thou makest darkness, and it is night: wherein all the beasts of the forest do creep [forth].<br><a name="21">21</a>  The young lions roar after their prey, and seek their meat from God.<br><a name="22">22</a>  The sun ariseth, they gather themselves together, and lay them down in their dens.<br><a name="23">23</a>  Man goeth forth unto his work and to his labour until the evening.<br><a name="24">24</a>  O LORD, how manifold are thy works! in wisdom hast thou made them all: the earth is full of thy riches.<br><a name="25">25</a>  [So is] this great and wide sea, wherein [are] things creeping innumerable, both small and great beasts.<br><a name="26">26</a>  There go the ships: [there is] that leviathan, [whom] thou hast made to play therein.<br><a name="27">27</a>  These wait all upon thee; that thou mayest give [them] their meat in due season.<br><a name="28">28</a>  [That] thou givest them they gather: thou openest thine hand, they are filled with good.<br><a name="29">29</a>  Thou hidest thy face, they are troubled: thou takest away their breath, they die, and return to their dust.<br><a name="30">30</a>  Thou sendest forth thy spirit, they are created: and thou renewest the face of the earth.<br><a name="31">31</a>. The glory of the LORD shall endure for ever: the LORD shall rejoice in his works.<br><a name="32">32</a>  He looketh on the earth, and it trembleth: he toucheth the hills, and they smoke.<br><a name="33">33</a>  I will sing unto the LORD as long as I live: I will sing praise to my God while I have my being.<br><a name="34">34</a>  My meditation of him shall be sweet: I will be glad in the LORD.<br><a name="35">35</a>  Let the sinners be consumed out of the earth, and let the wicked be no more. Bless thou the LORD, O my soul. Praise ye the LORD.<br><br>Go to <a href="psa105.htm#1">Psalm 105</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
