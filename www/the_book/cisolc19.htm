<b>Volume 3, Lesson 19</b><br>
by C.I. Scofield
<h2>The Practical Effect Upon the Believer<br>of the Second Coming of Christ</h2></center>
<p>The Jews were slow of heart to believe all that the prophets had spoken concerning the <i>sufferings</i> of their Messiah. We are slow of heart to believe all that they have spoken concerning His <i>glory.</i> Surely the greater reproach is ours, for it ought to be easier to believe that the Son of Man would come &quot;in the clouds of heaven, with power and great glory,&quot; than that He would come as the babe of Bethlehem, and the carpenter of Nazareth. The second advent (coming) is a promise to the Church as well as to the Jews.</p><b><ol type="A">
<li>Believers are comforted</b><ul>
<li><a href="joh14.htm#1">John 14:1-3</a> - &quot;Let not your heart be troubled... I will come again&quot;
<li><a href="1the4.htm#18">1Thessalonians 4:18</a> - &quot;Comfort one another with these words&quot;</ul>
<p>Among the last words, addressed by our Lord to His perplexed and sorrowing disciples before He accomplished the sacrifice of the cross, were words of comfort.</p><b>
<li>Believers are given hope</b><ul>
<li><a href="act1.htm#11">Acts 1:11</a> - &quot;This same Jesus... shall so come in like manner&quot;
<li><a href="1joh3.htm#2">1John 3:2</a> - &quot;We shall be like Him&quot;
<li><a href="tit2.htm#13">Titus 2:13</a> - &quot;Looking for that blessed hope&quot;
<li><a href="php3.htm#20">Philippians 3:20,21</a> - &quot;Our conversation [citizenship] is in heaven&quot;</ul>
<p>The return of Jesus Christ, and our gathering together unto Him, is the sure hope of every believer.</p><b>
<li>Believers are to watch, wait, and be ready</b><ul>
<li><a href="mar13.htm#33">Mark 13:33</a> - &quot;Take ye heed, watch and pray&quot;
<li><a href="1the1.htm#10">1Thessalonians 1:10</a> - &quot;Wait for His Son from heaven&quot;
<li><a href="mat24.htm#44">Matthew 24:44</a> - &quot;Be ye also ready&quot;
<li><a href="rev22.htm#12">Revelation 22:12</a> - &quot;To give every man according as his work shall be&quot;
<li><a href="rev22.htm#20">Revelation 22:20</a> - &quot;Even so, come, Lord Jesus.&quot; The last prayer in the Bible is one for Christ's speedy return.</ul>
<p>Believers are to look for the blessed hope of the church, the time when sleeping saints will be raised, and all saints will be changed. Believers will be caught up to meet the Lord, be like Him, and be rewarded for works done after salvation, for His name's sake.</p>
