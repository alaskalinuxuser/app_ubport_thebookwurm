Judges   3<br>1. Now these [are] the nations which the LORD left, to prove Israel by them, [even] as many [of Israel] as had not known all the wars of Canaan;<br><a name="2">2</a>  Only that the generations of the children of Israel might know, to teach them war, at the least such as before knew nothing thereof;<br><a name="3">3</a>  [Namely], five lords of the Philistines, and all the Canaanites, and the Sidonians, and the Hivites that dwelt in mount Lebanon, from mount Baalhermon unto the entering in of Hamath.<br><a name="4">4</a>  And they were to prove Israel by them, to know whether they would hearken unto the commandments of the LORD, which he commanded their fathers by the hand of Moses.<br><a name="5">5</a>  And the children of Israel dwelt among the Canaanites, Hittites, and Amorites, and Perizzites, and Hivites, and Jebusites:<br><a name="6">6</a>  And they took their daughters to be their wives, and gave their daughters to their sons, and served their gods.<br><a name="7">7</a>  And the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the LORD, and forgat the LORD their God, and served Baalim and the groves.<br><a name="8">8</a>. Therefore the anger of the LORD was hot against Israel, and he sold them into the hand of Chushanrishathaim king of Mesopotamia: and the children of Israel served Chushanrishathaim eight years.<br><a name="9">9</a>  And when the children of Israel cried unto the LORD, the LORD raised up a deliverer to the children of Israel, who delivered them, [even] Othniel the son of Kenaz, Caleb's younger brother.<br><a name="10">10</a>  And the Spirit of the LORD came upon him, and he judged Israel, and went out to war: and the LORD delivered Chushanrishathaim king of Mesopotamia into his hand; and his hand prevailed against Chushanrishathaim.<br><a name="11">11</a>  And the land had rest forty years. And Othniel the son of Kenaz died.<br><a name="12">12</a>. And the children of Israel did evil again in the sight of the LORD: and the LORD strengthened Eglon the king of Moab against Israel, because they had done evil in the sight of the LORD.<br><a name="13">13</a>  And he gathered unto him the children of Ammon and Amalek, and went and smote Israel, and possessed the city of palm trees.<br><a name="14">14</a>  So the children of Israel served Eglon the king of Moab eighteen years.<br><a name="15">15</a>  But when the children of Israel cried unto the LORD, the LORD raised them up a deliverer, Ehud the son of Gera, a Benjamite, a man lefthanded: and by him the children of Israel sent a present unto Eglon the king of Moab.<br><a name="16">16</a>  But Ehud made him a dagger which had two edges, of a cubit length; and he did gird it under his raiment upon his right thigh.<br><a name="17">17</a>  And he brought the present unto Eglon king of Moab: and Eglon [was] a very fat man.<br><a name="18">18</a>  And when he had made an end to offer the present, he sent away the people that bare the present.<br><a name="19">19</a>  But he himself turned again from the quarries that [were] by Gilgal, and said, I have a secret errand unto thee, O king: who said, Keep silence. And all that stood by him went out from him.<br><a name="20">20</a>  And Ehud came unto him; and he was sitting in a summer parlour, which he had for himself alone. And Ehud said, I have a message from God unto thee. And he arose out of [his] seat.<br><a name="21">21</a>  And Ehud put forth his left hand, and took the dagger from his right thigh, and thrust it into his belly:<br><a name="22">22</a>  And the haft also went in after the blade; and the fat closed upon the blade, so that he could not draw the dagger out of his belly; and the dirt came out.<br><a name="23">23</a>  Then Ehud went forth through the porch, and shut the doors of the parlour upon him, and locked them.<br><a name="24">24</a>  When he was gone out, his servants came; and when they saw that, behold, the doors of the parlour [were] locked, they said, Surely he covereth his feet in his summer chamber.<br><a name="25">25</a>  And they tarried till they were ashamed: and, behold, he opened not the doors of the parlour; therefore they took a key, and opened [them]: and, behold, their lord [was] fallen down dead on the earth.<br><a name="26">26</a>  And Ehud escaped while they tarried, and passed beyond the quarries, and escaped unto Seirath.<br><a name="27">27</a>  And it came to pass, when he was come, that he blew a trumpet in the mountain of Ephraim, and the children of Israel went down with him from the mount, and he before them.<br><a name="28">28</a>  And he said unto them, Follow after me: for the LORD hath delivered your enemies the Moabites into your hand. And they went down after him, and took the fords of Jordan toward Moab, and suffered not a man to pass over.<br><a name="29">29</a>  And they slew of Moab at that time about ten thousand men, all lusty, and all men of valour; and there escaped not a man.<br><a name="30">30</a>  So Moab was subdued that day under the hand of Israel. And the land had rest fourscore years.<br><a name="31">31</a>. And after him was Shamgar the son of Anath, which slew of the Philistines six hundred men with an ox goad: and he also delivered Israel.<br><br>Go to <a href="judg4.htm#1">Judges 4</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
