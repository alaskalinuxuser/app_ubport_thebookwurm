Psalms 103<br>1. [A Psalm] of David. Bless the LORD, O my soul: and all that is within me, [bless] his holy name.<br><a name="2">2</a>  Bless the LORD, O my soul, and forget not all his benefits:<br><a name="3">3</a>  Who forgiveth all thine iniquities; who healeth all thy diseases;<br><a name="4">4</a>  Who redeemeth thy life from destruction; who crowneth thee with lovingkindness and tender mercies;<br><a name="5">5</a>  Who satisfieth thy mouth with good [things; so that] thy youth is renewed like the eagle's.<br><a name="6">6</a>. The LORD executeth righteousness and judgment for all that are oppressed.<br><a name="7">7</a>  He made known his ways unto Moses, his acts unto the children of Israel.<br><a name="8">8</a>  The LORD [is] merciful and gracious, slow to anger, and plenteous in mercy.<br><a name="9">9</a>  He will not always chide: neither will he keep [his anger] for ever.<br><a name="10">10</a>  He hath not dealt with us after our sins; nor rewarded us according to our iniquities.<br><a name="11">11</a>  For as the heaven is high above the earth, [so] great is his mercy toward them that fear him.<br><a name="12">12</a>  As far as the east is from the west, [so] far hath he removed our transgressions from us.<br><a name="13">13</a>  Like as a father pitieth [his] children, [so] the LORD pitieth them that fear him.<br><a name="14">14</a>  For he knoweth our frame; he remembereth that we [are] dust.<br><a name="15">15</a>  [As for] man, his days [are] as grass: as a flower of the field, so he flourisheth.<br><a name="16">16</a>  For the wind passeth over it, and it is gone; and the place thereof shall know it no more.<br><a name="17">17</a>  But the mercy of the LORD [is] from everlasting to everlasting upon them that fear him, and his righteousness unto children's children;<br><a name="18">18</a>  To such as keep his covenant, and to those that remember his commandments to do them.<br><a name="19">19</a>. The LORD hath prepared his throne in the heavens; and his kingdom ruleth over all.<br><a name="20">20</a>  Bless the LORD, ye his angels, that excel in strength, that do his commandments, hearkening unto the voice of his word.<br><a name="21">21</a>  Bless ye the LORD, all [ye] his hosts; [ye] ministers of his, that do his pleasure.<br><a name="22">22</a>  Bless the LORD, all his works in all places of his dominion: bless the LORD, O my soul.<br><br>Go to <a href="psa104.htm#1">Psalm 104</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
