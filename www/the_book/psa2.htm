Psalms   2<br> 1. Why do the heathen rage, and the people imagine a vain thing?<br><a name="2">2</a>  The kings of the earth set themselves, and the rulers take counsel together, against the LORD, and against his anointed, [saying],<br><a name="3">3</a>  Let us break their bands asunder, and cast away their cords from us.<br><a name="4">4</a>  He that sitteth in the heavens shall laugh: the Lord shall have them in derision.<br><a name="5">5</a>  Then shall he speak unto them in his wrath, and vex them in his sore displeasure.<br><a name="6">6</a>  Yet have I set my king upon my holy hill of Zion.<br><a name="7">7</a>. I will declare the decree: the LORD hath said unto me, Thou [art] my Son; this day have I begotten thee.<br><a name="8">8</a>  Ask of me, and I shall give [thee] the heathen [for] thine inheritance, and the uttermost parts of the earth [for] thy possession.<br><a name="9">9</a>  Thou shalt break them with a rod of iron; thou shalt dash them in pieces like a potter's vessel.<br><a name="10">10</a>. Be wise now therefore, O ye kings: be instructed, ye judges of the earth.<br><a name="11">11</a>  Serve the LORD with fear, and rejoice with trembling.<br><a name="12">12</a>  Kiss the Son, lest he be angry, and ye perish [from] the way, when his wrath is kindled but a little. Blessed [are] all they that put their trust in him.<br><br>Go to <a href="psa3.htm#1">Psalm 3</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
