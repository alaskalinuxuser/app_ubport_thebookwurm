<dl>
<dt><b><i>4:14 Seeing then that we have a great high priest,<br>
that is passed into the heavens, Jesus the Son of God,<br>
let us hold fast [our] profession.</i></b></dt><dl>
<dt>seeing then- ie., these things being so...
<dd>Thus far, in considering Christ (<a href="heb3.htm#1">3:1</a>), we have found Him to be superior to Moses, and to provide a better rest than Joshua.
<dd>We will now consider the High Priesthood of Christ (4:14-10:18). 
<dd>First, we see that His priesthood is superior to the Aaronic priesthood (4:14-7:28).
<dt>passed into {through} the heavens-
<dd> not merely through the veil into the holiest place, in an earthly temple (as did the OT high priest).
<dt>our profession- GK=homologia, lit., ''speaking the same thing,'' confession,<dd>We are to continually acknowledge the truth.  What truth?<ul>
<li>The truth concerning Christ (eg., <a href="heb3.htm#1">3:1-</a>; <a href="heb10.htm#23">10:23</a>),<br>which is declared by the testimony &amp; conduct of believers (eg., <a href="heb11.htm#13">11:13</a>). cp. <a href="1tim6.htm#12">1Tim 6:12</a>
<li>The truth concerning my fleshly weakness, <br>which is revealed by the scrutiny of God's Word (eg., <a href="heb4.htm#12" target="lwr_lt">4:12,13</a>; <a href="1joh1.htm#8">1Joh 1:8,9</a>).</ul></dl>
<dt><b><i>4:15 For we have not an high priest<br>
which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities;<br>
but was in all points tempted like as [we are, yet] without sin.</i></b></dt><dl>
<dt>touched with the feeling- GK= sumpatheo, compassion.
<dd>Christ can sympathize with our fleshly weakness.
<dd>He became a man and experienced the effects of sin (<a href="heb2.htm#17">2:17,18</a>). cp. <a href="mat8.htm#17">Mat 8:17</a>
<dt>tempted- ie., tested...
<dt>in all points- cp. the three points of temptation common to all sin:
<dd>&quot;The lust of the flesh, The lust of the eyes, and The pride of life.&quot; <a href="1joh2.htm#16">1Joh 2:16</a>
<dd>Satan used each of these in attacking Eve, Jesus, and all men. <a href="gen3.htm#1">Gen 3:1-6</a>;  <a href="luk4.htm#1">Luke 4:1-13</a>
<dd>We, like Eve, fail on all three. But Jesus is...
<dt>without {apart from} sin- As the God/Man, He could not sin.
<dd>But He did not have it easy. He endured pressure, beyond that to which we are subjected, precisely because He was immovable. A ship tossed at sea is less battered by the storm than a ship grounded on rock. <a href="joh14.htm#30">Joh 14:30</a>; <a href="heb7.htm#26">Heb 7:26</a></dl>
<dt><b><i>4:16 Let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace,<br>
that we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need.</i></b></dt><dl>
<dt>therefore- ie., Since we have such a High Priest...
<dt>boldly- GK=parrhesia, lit., ''with all speech,'' with freedom of speech.
<dd>(Not 'brazenly' or 'flippantly' as the English word 'boldly' might imply.)
<dd>We can come 'freely' with complete 'openness,' knowing that He understands.
<dt>mercy- applies retroactively for sins already committed. <a href="tit3.htm#5">Titus 3:5</a>; <a href="1joh1.htm#9">1Joh 1:9</a>
<dt>grace to help- provides timely assistance in present &amp; future testing.
<dd>He is able to deliver. If we would confess our temptation &amp; weakness and trust Him, we would find rest- even in the presence of our enemies.</dl>
<dt><b><a href="heb5.htm#1" target="lwr_lt">Hebrews 5:1-14</a></b>
<dt><b><i>5:1 For every high priest taken from among men is ordained<br>
for men in things [pertaining] to God,<br>
that he may offer both gifts and sacrifices for sins:</i></b></dt><dl>
<dt><a href="heb5.htm#1" target="lwr_lt">vs.1-4</a> Define the requirements of 'every high priest' in the Levitical Priesthood.
<dt>A priest must...<ol>
<li>Be a man- 'taken from among men...'<br>
So that he can represent men before God. '...for men' (<a href="heb5.htm#1" target="lwr_lt">v.1,2</a>)
<li>Be appointed by God- 'ordained... to God' (see <a href="heb5.htm#4" target="lwr_lt">v.4</a>).
<li>Bring acceptable sacrifices for sins (plural) to God (see <a href="heb5.htm#3" target="lwr_lt">v.3</a>).</ol></dl>
<dt><b><i>5:2 Who can have compassion on the ignorant,<br>
and on them that are out of the way;<br>
for that he himself also is compassed with infirmity.</i></b></dt><dl>
<dt>compassion- GK=metriopatheo, lit., ''measured emotions,'' care without undue harshness...
<dt>...on the ignorant- Those who should have known better.
<dt>...on the wayward- Those who should have done better. <a href="pro14.htm#12">Pro 14:12</a>; <a href="rom3.htm#12">Rom 3:12</a>
<dt>The human priest, because of his own physical &amp; moral weakness,<dd>can understand the weakness of the men whom he represents before God.</dl>
<dt><b><i>5:3 And by reason hereof he ought, as for the people,<br>
so also for himself, to offer for sins.</i></b></dt><dl>
<dt>Because every human priest is himself a sinner,
<dd>he must make sacrifice for his own sins, as well as for the sins of the people. <a href="lev16.htm#1">Lev 16:1-24</a></dl>
<dt><b><i>5:4 And no man taketh this honour unto himself,<br>
but he that is called of God, as [was] Aaron.</i></b></dt><dl>
<dt>Every true priest must be appointed by God, not by man, not by self.
<dd>Severe judgment falls upon those who usurp this position. 
<dd>(eg., Korah <a href="num16.htm#1">Num 16:1-35</a> and Saul <a href="1sam13.htm#9">1Sam 13:9-14</a>)</dl>
<dt><a name="5"></a>
<b><i>5:5 So also Christ glorified not himself to be made an high priest;<br>
but he that said unto him, Thou art my Son, to day have I begotten thee.</i></b> {<a href="psa2.htm#7">Psa 2:7</a>}</dt><dl>
<dt><a href="heb5.htm#5" target="lwr_lt">vs.5-10</a> Demonstrate that Christ satisfies the above requirements for Priesthood.
<dd>The following points will be developed in subsequent chapters.</dt><dl>
<dt><b>1.</b> Christ was Appointed by God-
<dd>A. Not as the multitude of human priests, but as God's unique Son.
<dd>The day of this glorification was the day of His resurrection. <a href="act13.htm#33">Acts 13:33</a></dl></dl>
<dt><b><i>5:6 As he saith also in another [place],<br>
Thou [art] a priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec.</i></b> {<a href="psa110.htm#4">Psa 110:4</a>}</dt><dl></dt><dl>
<dd>B. Not as a priest in the common Levitical order (of Aaron), but as a unique priest in a unique priestly order.<ul>
<li> Melchizedek is mentioned only twice in the OT: <a href="psa110.htm#4">Psa 110:4</a>; <a href="gen14.htm#18">Gen 14:18-20</a>
<li>The Aaronic priesthood pictures Christ's ministry, but the picture is flawed and incomplete. The Melchizedek priesthood completes the picture (as ch. 7 will explain).
<li>Jesus could not have been an Aaronic priest because He was of the tribe of Judah, not of Levi. There is no lineage connected with the Melchizedek priesthood. (cp. <a href="heb7.htm#13">7:13,14</a>; <a href="heb8.htm#4">8:4</a>)</ul></dl></dl>
<dt><b><i>5:7 Who in the days of his flesh,<br>
when he had offered up prayers and supplications with strong crying and tears<br>
unto him that was able to save him from</i></b> {out of} <b><i>death,<br>
and was heard in that he feared;</i></b></dt><dl></dt><dl>
<dt><b>2.</b> Christ, as a man, demonstrated that...<ul>
<li>He understands our weakness because 'in the days of his flesh...'<br>
- He was 'touched with the feelings our infirmities' (<a href="heb4.htm#15">4:15</a>).
<li>He is fit to represent us before God.<br>
- He offered powerful prayer to God. . . for others. . . for Himself. (v.7)
<dd>eg., <a href="joh11.htm#33">Joh 11:33-44</a>; <a href="joh12.htm#27">12:27</a>; <a href="luk22.htm#44">Luk 22:44</a>; <a href="mat27.htm#46">Mat 27:46,50</a></dd>
<dt>- His prayers were heard, because He feared God.<dd>fear- GK=eulabeia, lit., to speak well.</dd><dd>
ie., He looked always to God, even in the midst of His sorrows. <a href="psa27.htm#11">Psa 27:11-14</a></dd>
<dt>- His own resurrection is a primary example of answered prayer. <a href="psa40.htm#1">Psa 40:1-3</a></dt></ul>
</dl></dl>
<dt><b><i>5:8 Though he were a Son,<br>
yet learned he obedience by the things which he suffered;</i></b></dt><dl>
<dt>obedience- GK=hupoakoe [hupo- of, by, under; akouo- to hear with discernment, cp. <a href="heb4.htm#7">4:7</a>]
<dd>He was, as a man, in submission to God. He conducted Himself according to that which He discerned was God's will, even at the high cost of suffering &amp; death.
<dd>The Son, &quot;who had always commanded, learned practically what obedience meant.&quot; [HAIronside]
<dd>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="psa40.htm#6">Psa 40:6-8</a>; <a href="isa50.htm#5">Isa 50:5-7</a>; <a href="php2.htm#7">Php 2:7,8</a>; <a href="mat11.htm#28">Mat 11:28-30</a></dt><dl>
<dt><b>3.</b> Christ suffered as the sacrifice for sin. (cp. <a href="psa40.htm#6">Psa 40:6</a> above)
<dd>(This will be developed in subsequent chapters.)</dl></dl>
<dt><b><i>5:9 And being made perfect,<br>
he became the author of eternal salvation unto all them that obey him;</i></b></dt><dl>
<dt>made perfect- ie., complete, fully equipped as the 'captain' of salvation.
<dd>cp. <a href="heb2.htm#9">Heb 2:9,10</a> (where the word for 'author' is trans. 'captain') 
<dt>Note that salvation is-<ul>
<li>Eternal. He offers no other kind. Salvation which can be lost is not eternal.<br>
The One, who is priest 'forever,' secures eternal salvation (cp. v.6; <a href="heb7.htm#25">7:25</a>)
<li>For them that obey Him.
<dt>obey- GK=hupoakouo, see v.8 note above. cp. <a href="joh6.htm#28">Joh 6:28,29</a>; <a href="rom10.htm#16">Rom 10:16</a></ul></dl>
<dt><b><i>5:10 Called of God an high priest after the order of Melchisedec.</i></b> {see v.6}
<dd>The perfection, or completeness, of Christ as our High Priest will be better understood when compared with the priesthood of Melchizedek (in ch. 7).
<dt><b><i>5:11 Of whom we have many things to say, and hard to be uttered,<br>
seeing ye are dull of hearing.</i></b></dt><dl>
<dt><a href="heb5.htm#11" target="lwr_lt">vs.11-14</a> Rebuke the spiritual immaturity of the readers.
<dt>of whom...- ie., about Christ and Melchizedek...
<dt>dull- ie., slothful, sluggish.
<dd>ie., This profoundly important subject matter is difficult to communicate, because of the spiritual imperception of the hearers.</dl>
<dt><b><i>5:12 For when for the time ye ought to be teachers,<br>
ye have need that one teach you again<br>
which [be] the first principles of the oracles of God;<br>
and are become such as have need of milk, and not of strong meat.</i></b>
<dd>the time- ie., the time elapsed since you first believed.
<dd>the first principles- ie., the primary elements, rudimentary principles, the ABC's (eg. <a href="heb6.htm#1">6:1,2</a>).
<dd>the oracles of God- ie., God's written Word, <a href="rom3.htm#1">Rom 3:1,2</a>
<dd>strong meat- ie., solid food.
<dt><b><i>5:13 For every one that useth milk [is] unskilful in the word of righteousness:<br>
for he is a babe.</i></b></dt><dl>
<dt>Milk is essential for babies. But it is not an adequate diet for mature men.
<dd>Believers, who neglect chewing on the Word, stunt their own growth. <a href="1pet2.htm#1">1Pet 2:1,2</a>; <a href="1cor3.htm#1">1Cor 3:1,2</a></dl>
<dt><b><i>5:14 But strong meat belongeth to them that are of full age,<br>
[even] those who by reason of use have their senses exercised<br>
to discern both good and evil.</i></b>
<dd>Having rebuked us for our spiritual immaturity (in vs.11-14), the writer now seeks to build us up with stronger spiritual food and exercise. The goal is discernment (cp. <a href="heb4.htm#12">4:12</a>) between<i> good </i>(GK=kalos) and<i> evil </i>(GK=kakos) doctrine. Note that to the untrained ear, these two Greek words sound similar. But their meanings are opposites.
