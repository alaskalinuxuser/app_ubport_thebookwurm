Revelation  15<br> 1. And I saw another sign in heaven, great and marvellous, seven angels having the seven last plagues; for in them is filled up the wrath of God.<br><a name="2">2</a>  And I saw as it were a sea of glass mingled with fire: and them that had gotten the victory over the beast, and over his image, and over his mark, [and] over the number of his name, stand on the sea of glass, having the harps of God.<br><a name="3">3</a>  And they sing the song of Moses the servant of God, and the song of the Lamb, saying, Great and marvellous [are] thy works, Lord God Almighty; just and true [are] thy ways, thou King of saints.<br><a name="4">4</a>  Who shall not fear thee, O Lord, and glorify thy name? for [thou] only [art] holy: for all nations shall come and worship before thee; for thy judgments are made manifest.<br><a name="5">5</a>. And after that I looked, and, behold, the temple of the tabernacle of the testimony in heaven was opened:<br><a name="6">6</a>  And the seven angels came out of the temple, having the seven plagues, clothed in pure and white linen, and having their breasts girded with golden girdles.<br><a name="7">7</a>  And one of the four beasts gave unto the seven angels seven golden vials full of the wrath of God, who liveth for ever and ever.<br><a name="8">8</a>  And the temple was filled with smoke from the glory of God, and from his power; and no man was able to enter into the temple, till the seven plagues of the seven angels were fulfilled.<br><br>Go to <a href="rev16.htm#1">Revelation 16</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
