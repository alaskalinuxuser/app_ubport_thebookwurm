Psalms  18<br> 1. To the chief Musician, [A Psalm] of David, the servant of the LORD, who spake unto the LORD the words of this song in the day [that] the LORD delivered him from the hand of all his enemies, and from the hand of Saul: And he said, I will love thee, O LORD, my strength.<br><a name="2">2</a>  The LORD [is] my rock, and my fortress, and my deliverer; my God, my strength, in whom I will trust; my buckler, and the horn of my salvation, [and] my high tower.<br><a name="3">3</a>  I will call upon the LORD, [who is worthy] to be praised: so shall I be saved from mine enemies.<br><a name="4">4</a>  The sorrows of death compassed me, and the floods of ungodly men made me afraid.<br><a name="5">5</a>  The sorrows of hell compassed me about: the snares of death prevented me.<br><a name="6">6</a>  In my distress I called upon the LORD, and cried unto my God: he heard my voice out of his temple, and my cry came before him, [even] into his ears.<br><a name="7">7</a>  Then the earth shook and trembled; the foundations also of the hills moved and were shaken, because he was wroth.<br><a name="8">8</a>  There went up a smoke out of his nostrils, and fire out of his mouth devoured: coals were kindled by it.<br><a name="9">9</a>  He bowed the heavens also, and came down: and darkness [was] under his feet.<br><a name="10">10</a>  And he rode upon a cherub, and did fly: yea, he did fly upon the wings of the wind.<br><a name="11">11</a>  He made darkness his secret place; his pavilion round about him [were] dark waters [and] thick clouds of the skies.<br><a name="12">12</a>  At the brightness [that was] before him his thick clouds passed, hail [stones] and coals of fire.<br><a name="13">13</a>  The LORD also thundered in the heavens, and the Highest gave his voice; hail [stones] and coals of fire.<br><a name="14">14</a>  Yea, he sent out his arrows, and scattered them; and he shot out lightnings, and discomfited them.<br><a name="15">15</a>  Then the channels of waters were seen, and the foundations of the world were discovered at thy rebuke, O LORD, at the blast of the breath of thy nostrils.<br><a name="16">16</a>  He sent from above, he took me, he drew me out of many waters.<br><a name="17">17</a>  He delivered me from my strong enemy, and from them which hated me: for they were too strong for me.<br><a name="18">18</a>  They prevented me in the day of my calamity: but the LORD was my stay.<br><a name="19">19</a>  He brought me forth also into a large place; he delivered me, because he delighted in me.<br><a name="20">20</a>. The LORD rewarded me according to my righteousness; according to the cleanness of my hands hath he recompensed me.<br><a name="21">21</a>  For I have kept the ways of the LORD, and have not wickedly departed from my God.<br><a name="22">22</a>  For all his judgments [were] before me, and I did not put away his statutes from me.<br><a name="23">23</a>  I was also upright before him, and I kept myself from mine iniquity.<br><a name="24">24</a>  Therefore hath the LORD recompensed me according to my righteousness, according to the cleanness of my hands in his eyesight.<br><a name="25">25</a>  With the merciful thou wilt shew thyself merciful; with an upright man thou wilt shew thyself upright;<br><a name="26">26</a>  With the pure thou wilt shew thyself pure; and with the froward thou wilt shew thyself froward.<br><a name="27">27</a>  For thou wilt save the afflicted people; but wilt bring down high looks.<br><a name="28">28</a>  For thou wilt light my candle: the LORD my God will enlighten my darkness.<br><a name="29">29</a>. For by thee I have run through a troop; and by my God have I leaped over a wall.<br><a name="30">30</a>  [As for] God, his way [is] perfect: the word of the LORD is tried: he [is] a buckler to all those that trust in him.<br><a name="31">31</a>  For who [is] God save the LORD? or who [is] a rock save our God?<br><a name="32">32</a>  [It is] God that girdeth me with strength, and maketh my way perfect.<br><a name="33">33</a>  He maketh my feet like hinds' [feet], and setteth me upon my high places.<br><a name="34">34</a>  He teacheth my hands to war, so that a bow of steel is broken by mine arms.<br><a name="35">35</a>  Thou hast also given me the shield of thy salvation: and thy right hand hath holden me up, and thy gentleness hath made me great.<br><a name="36">36</a>  Thou hast enlarged my steps under me, that my feet did not slip.<br><a name="37">37</a>  I have pursued mine enemies, and overtaken them: neither did I turn again till they were consumed.<br><a name="38">38</a>  I have wounded them that they were not able to rise: they are fallen under my feet.<br><a name="39">39</a>  For thou hast girded me with strength unto the battle: thou hast subdued under me those that rose up against me.<br><a name="40">40</a>  Thou hast also given me the necks of mine enemies; that I might destroy them that hate me.<br><a name="41">41</a>  They cried, but [there was] none to save [them: even] unto the LORD, but he answered them not.<br><a name="42">42</a>  Then did I beat them small as the dust before the wind: I did cast them out as the dirt in the streets.<br><a name="43">43</a>  Thou hast delivered me from the strivings of the people; [and] thou hast made me the head of the heathen: a people [whom] I have not known shall serve me.<br><a name="44">44</a>  As soon as they hear of me, they shall obey me: the strangers shall submit themselves unto me.<br><a name="45">45</a>  The strangers shall fade away, and be afraid out of their close places.<br><a name="46">46</a>  The LORD liveth; and blessed [be] my rock; and let the God of my salvation be exalted.<br><a name="47">47</a>  [It is] God that avengeth me, and subdueth the people under me.<br><a name="48">48</a>  He delivereth me from mine enemies: yea, thou liftest me up above those that rise up against me: thou hast delivered me from the violent man.<br><a name="49">49</a>  Therefore will I give thanks unto thee, O LORD, among the heathen, and sing praises unto thy name.<br><a name="50">50</a>  Great deliverance giveth he to his king; and sheweth mercy to his anointed, to David, and to his seed for evermore.<br><br>Go to <a href="psa19.htm#1">Psalm 19</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
