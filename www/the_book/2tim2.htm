2Timothy   2<br>1. Thou therefore, my son, be strong in the grace that is in Christ Jesus.<br><a name="2">2</a>  And the things that thou hast heard of me among many witnesses, the same commit thou to faithful men, who shall be able to teach others also.<br><a name="3">3</a>  Thou therefore endure hardness, as a good soldier of Jesus Christ.<br><a name="4">4</a>  No man that warreth entangleth himself with the affairs of [this] life; that he may please him who hath chosen him to be a soldier.<br><a name="5">5</a>  And if a man also strive for masteries, [yet] is he not crowned, except he strive lawfully.<br><a name="6">6</a>  The husbandman that laboureth must be first partaker of the fruits.<br><a name="7">7</a>  Consider what I say; and the Lord give thee understanding in all things.<br><a name="8">8</a>. Remember that Jesus Christ of the seed of David was raised from the dead according to my gospel:<br><a name="9">9</a>  Wherein I suffer trouble, as an evil doer, [even] unto bonds; but the word of God is not bound.<br><a name="10">10</a>  Therefore I endure all things for the elect's sakes, that they may also obtain the salvation which is in Christ Jesus with eternal glory.<br><a name="11">11</a>  [It is] a faithful saying: For if we be dead with [him], we shall also live with [him]:<br><a name="12">12</a>  If we suffer, we shall also reign with [him]: if we deny [him], he also will deny us:<br><a name="13">13</a>  If we believe not, [yet] he abideth faithful: he cannot deny himself.<br><a name="14">14</a>. Of these things put [them] in remembrance, charging [them] before the Lord that they strive not about words to no profit, [but] to the subverting of the hearers.<br><a name="15">15</a>  Study to shew thyself approved unto God, a workman that needeth not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth.<br><a name="16">16</a>  But shun profane [and] vain babblings: for they will increase unto more ungodliness.<br><a name="17">17</a>  And their word will eat as doth a canker: of whom is Hymenaeus and Philetus;<br><a name="18">18</a>  Who concerning the truth have erred, saying that the resurrection is past already; and overthrow the faith of some.<br><a name="19">19</a>. Nevertheless the foundation of God standeth sure, having this seal, The Lord knoweth them that are his. And, Let every one that nameth the name of Christ depart from iniquity.<br><a name="20">20</a>  But in a great house there are not only vessels of gold and of silver, but also of wood and of earth; and some to honour, and some to dishonour.<br><a name="21">21</a>  If a man therefore purge himself from these, he shall be a vessel unto honour, sanctified, and meet for the master's use, [and] prepared unto every good work.<br><a name="22">22</a>. Flee also youthful lusts: but follow righteousness, faith, charity, peace, with them that call on the Lord out of a pure heart.<br><a name="23">23</a>  But foolish and unlearned questions avoid, knowing that they do gender strifes.<br><a name="24">24</a>  And the servant of the Lord must not strive; but be gentle unto all [men], apt to teach, patient,<br><a name="25">25</a>  In meekness instructing those that oppose themselves; if God peradventure will give them repentance to the acknowledging of the truth;<br><a name="26">26</a>  And [that] they may recover themselves out of the snare of the devil, who are taken captive by him at his will.<br><br>Go to <a href="2tim3.htm#1">II Timothy 3</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
