2Samuel   8<br>1. And after this it came to pass, that David smote the Philistines, and subdued them: and David took Methegammah out of the hand of the Philistines.<br><a name="2">2</a>  And he smote Moab, and measured them with a line, casting them down to the ground; even with two lines measured he to put to death, and with one full line to keep alive. And [so] the Moabites became David's servants, [and] brought gifts.<br><a name="3">3</a>  David smote also Hadadezer, the son of Rehob, king of Zobah, as he went to recover his border at the river Euphrates.<br><a name="4">4</a>  And David took from him a thousand [chariots], and seven hundred horsemen, and twenty thousand footmen: and David houghed all the chariot [horses], but reserved of them [for] an hundred chariots.<br><a name="5">5</a>  And when the Syrians of Damascus came to succour Hadadezer king of Zobah, David slew of the Syrians two and twenty thousand men.<br><a name="6">6</a>  Then David put garrisons in Syria of Damascus: and the Syrians became servants to David, [and] brought gifts. And the LORD preserved David whithersoever he went.<br><a name="7">7</a>  And David took the shields of gold that were on the servants of Hadadezer, and brought them to Jerusalem.<br><a name="8">8</a>  And from Betah, and from Berothai, cities of Hadadezer, king David took exceeding much brass.<br><a name="9">9</a>. When Toi king of Hamath heard that David had smitten all the host of Hadadezer,<br><a name="10">10</a>  Then Toi sent Joram his son unto king David, to salute him, and to bless him, because he had fought against Hadadezer, and smitten him: for Hadadezer had wars with Toi. And [Joram] brought with him vessels of silver, and vessels of gold, and vessels of brass:<br><a name="11">11</a>  Which also king David did dedicate unto the LORD, with the silver and gold that he had dedicated of all nations which he subdued;<br><a name="12">12</a>  Of Syria, and of Moab, and of the children of Ammon, and of the Philistines, and of Amalek, and of the spoil of Hadadezer, son of Rehob, king of Zobah.<br><a name="13">13</a>  And David gat [him] a name when he returned from smiting of the Syrians in the valley of salt, [being] eighteen thousand [men].<br><a name="14">14</a>  And he put garrisons in Edom; throughout all Edom put he garrisons, and all they of Edom became David's servants. And the LORD preserved David whithersoever he went.<br><a name="15">15</a>. And David reigned over all Israel; and David executed judgment and justice unto all his people.<br><a name="16">16</a>  And Joab the son of Zeruiah [was] over the host; and Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud [was] recorder;<br><a name="17">17</a>  And Zadok the son of Ahitub, and Ahimelech the son of Abiathar, [were] the priests; and Seraiah [was] the scribe;<br><a name="18">18</a>  And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada [was over] both the Cherethites and the Pelethites; and David's sons were chief rulers.<br><br>Go to <a href="2sam9.htm#1">II Samuel 9</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
