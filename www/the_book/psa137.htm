By the rivers of Babylon, there we sat down, yea, we wept, when we remembered Zion.<br><a name="2">2</a>  We hanged our harps upon the willows in the midst thereof.<br><a name="3">3</a>  For there they that carried us away captive required of us a song; and they that wasted us [required of us] mirth, [saying], Sing us [one] of the songs of Zion.<br><a name="4">4</a>  How shall we sing the LORD'S song in a strange land?<br><a name="5">5</a>  If I forget thee, O Jerusalem, let my right hand forget [her cunning].<br><a name="6">6</a>  If I do not remember thee, let my tongue cleave to the roof of my mouth; if I prefer not Jerusalem above my chief joy.<br><a name="7">7</a>. Remember, O LORD, the children of Edom in the day of Jerusalem; who said, Rase [it], rase [it, even] to the foundation thereof.<br><a name="8">8</a>  O daughter of Babylon, who art to be destroyed; happy [shall he be], that rewardeth thee as thou hast served us.<br><a name="9">9</a>  Happy [shall he be], that taketh and dasheth thy little ones against the stones.<br><br>Go to <a href="psa138.htm#1">Psalm 138</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
