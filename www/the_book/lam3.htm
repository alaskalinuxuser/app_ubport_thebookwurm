Lamentations   3<br> 1. I [am] the man [that] hath seen affliction by the rod of his wrath.<br><a name="2">2</a>  He hath led me, and brought [me into] darkness, but not [into] light.<br><a name="3">3</a>  Surely against me is he turned; he turneth his hand [against me] all the day.<br><a name="4">4</a>  My flesh and my skin hath he made old; he hath broken my bones.<br><a name="5">5</a>  He hath builded against me, and compassed [me] with gall and travail.<br><a name="6">6</a>  He hath set me in dark places, as [they that be] dead of old.<br><a name="7">7</a>  He hath hedged me about, that I cannot get out: he hath made my chain heavy.<br><a name="8">8</a>  Also when I cry and shout, he shutteth out my prayer.<br><a name="9">9</a>  He hath inclosed my ways with hewn stone, he hath made my paths crooked.<br><a name="10">10</a>  He [was] unto me [as] a bear lying in wait, [and as] a lion in secret places.<br><a name="11">11</a>  He hath turned aside my ways, and pulled me in pieces: he hath made me desolate.<br><a name="12">12</a>  He hath bent his bow, and set me as a mark for the arrow.<br><a name="13">13</a>  He hath caused the arrows of his quiver to enter into my reins.<br><a name="14">14</a>  I was a derision to all my people; [and] their song all the day.<br><a name="15">15</a>  He hath filled me with bitterness, he hath made me drunken with wormwood.<br><a name="16">16</a>  He hath also broken my teeth with gravel stones, he hath covered me with ashes.<br><a name="17">17</a>  And thou hast removed my soul far off from peace: I forgat prosperity.<br><a name="18">18</a>  And I said, My strength and my hope is perished from the LORD:<br><a name="19">19</a>  Remembering mine affliction and my misery, the wormwood and the gall.<br><a name="20">20</a>  My soul hath [them] still in remembrance, and is humbled in me.<br><a name="21">21</a>. This I recall to my mind, therefore have I hope.<br><a name="22">22</a>  [It is of] the LORD'S mercies that we are not consumed, because his compassions fail not.<br><a name="23">23</a>  [They are] new every morning: great [is] thy faithfulness.<br><a name="24">24</a>  The LORD [is] my portion, saith my soul; therefore will I hope in him.<br><a name="25">25</a>  The LORD [is] good unto them that wait for him, to the soul [that] seeketh him.<br><a name="26">26</a>  [It is] good that [a man] should both hope and quietly wait for the salvation of the LORD.<br><a name="27">27</a>  [It is] good for a man that he bear the yoke in his youth.<br><a name="28">28</a>  He sitteth alone and keepeth silence, because he hath borne [it] upon him.<br><a name="29">29</a>  He putteth his mouth in the dust; if so be there may be hope.<br><a name="30">30</a>  He giveth [his] cheek to him that smiteth him: he is filled full with reproach.<br><a name="31">31</a>  For the Lord will not cast off for ever:<br><a name="32">32</a>  But though he cause grief, yet will he have compassion according to the multitude of his mercies.<br><a name="33">33</a>  For he doth not afflict willingly nor grieve the children of men.<br><a name="34">34</a>  To crush under his feet all the prisoners of the earth,<br><a name="35">35</a>  To turn aside the right of a man before the face of the most High,<br><a name="36">36</a>  To subvert a man in his cause, the Lord approveth not.<br><a name="37">37</a>. Who [is] he [that] saith, and it cometh to pass, [when] the Lord commandeth [it] not?<br><a name="38">38</a>  Out of the mouth of the most High proceedeth not evil and good?<br><a name="39">39</a>  Wherefore doth a living man complain, a man for the punishment of his sins?<br><a name="40">40</a>  Let us search and try our ways, and turn again to the LORD.<br><a name="41">41</a>  Let us lift up our heart with [our] hands unto God in the heavens.<br><a name="42">42</a>. We have transgressed and have rebelled: thou hast not pardoned.<br><a name="43">43</a>  Thou hast covered with anger, and persecuted us: thou hast slain, thou hast not pitied.<br><a name="44">44</a>  Thou hast covered thyself with a cloud, that [our] prayer should not pass through.<br><a name="45">45</a>  Thou hast made us [as] the offscouring and refuse in the midst of the people.<br><a name="46">46</a>  All our enemies have opened their mouths against us.<br><a name="47">47</a>  Fear and a snare is come upon us, desolation and destruction.<br><a name="48">48</a>  Mine eye runneth down with rivers of water for the destruction of the daughter of my people.<br><a name="49">49</a>  Mine eye trickleth down, and ceaseth not, without any intermission,<br><a name="50">50</a>  Till the LORD look down, and behold from heaven.<br><a name="51">51</a>  Mine eye affecteth mine heart because of all the daughters of my city.<br><a name="52">52</a>  Mine enemies chased me sore, like a bird, without cause.<br><a name="53">53</a>  They have cut off my life in the dungeon, and cast a stone upon me.<br><a name="54">54</a>  Waters flowed over mine head; [then] I said, I am cut off.<br><a name="55">55</a>. I called upon thy name, O LORD, out of the low dungeon.<br><a name="56">56</a>  Thou hast heard my voice: hide not thine ear at my breathing, at my cry.<br><a name="57">57</a>  Thou drewest near in the day [that] I called upon thee: thou saidst, Fear not.<br><a name="58">58</a>  O Lord, thou hast pleaded the causes of my soul; thou hast redeemed my life.<br><a name="59">59</a>  O LORD, thou hast seen my wrong: judge thou my cause.<br><a name="60">60</a>  Thou hast seen all their vengeance [and] all their imaginations against me.<br><a name="61">61</a>  Thou hast heard their reproach, O LORD, [and] all their imaginations against me;<br><a name="62">62</a>  The lips of those that rose up against me, and their device against me all the day.<br><a name="63">63</a>  Behold their sitting down, and their rising up; I [am] their musick.<br><a name="64">64</a>  Render unto them a recompence, O LORD, according to the work of their hands.<br><a name="65">65</a>  Give them sorrow of heart, thy curse unto them.<br><a name="66">66</a>  Persecute and destroy them in anger from under the heavens of the LORD.<br><br>Go to <a href="lam4.htm#1">Lamentations 4</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
