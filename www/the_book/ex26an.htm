<dt><dt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Coverings of the Tabernacle (<a href="ex26.htm#1" target="lwr_lt">v.1-14</a>) -
<dt><b><i>26:1 Moreover thou shalt make the tabernacle [with] ten curtains [of] fine twined linen,<br>and blue, and purple, and scarlet: [with] cherubims of cunning work shalt thou make them.<br>
26:2 The length of one curtain [shall be] eight and twenty cubits,<br>and the breadth of one curtain four cubits:<br>and every one of the curtains shall have one measure.<br>
26:3 The five curtains shall be coupled together one to another;<br>and [other] five curtains [shall be] coupled one to another.<br>
26:4 And thou shalt make loops of blue upon the edge of the one curtain from the selvedge in the coupling;<br>and likewise shalt thou make in the uttermost edge of [another] curtain, in the coupling of the second.<br>
26:5 Fifty loops shalt thou make in the one curtain,<br>and fifty loops shalt thou make in the edge of the curtain that [is] in the coupling of the second;<br>that the loops may take hold one of another.<br>
26:6 And thou shalt make fifty taches </b></i>{ie., hooks, clasps}<i><b> of gold,<br>and couple the curtains together with the taches:<br>and it shall be one tabernacle.</i></b></dt><dl>
<dt>The Tabernacle (lit., 'tent') was roofed with four layers of material, <dd>which were supported by walls of boards. These 'Coverings' also speak of Christ.
<dt>The inner covering was woven of four types of thread, each speaking of our Lord.-<ol type="a">
<li>fine twined linen - Christ the Righteous One. cp. <a href="rev19.htm#8">Rev 19:8</a>; <a href="1cor1.htm#30">1Cor 1:30</a>; <a href="1joh2.htm#1">1Joh 2:1</a>
<li>blue - Christ the Heavenly One. <a href="joh1.htm#18">Joh 1:18</a>
<li>purple - Christ the Royal One. <a href="mat2.htm#2">Mat 2:2</a>; <a href="mat27.htm#11">27:11,37</a>
<li>scarlet - Christ the Suffering One, who came to shed His blood for us. <a href="isa53.htm#3">Isa 53:3-8</a>; <a href="heb9.htm#11">Heb 9:11,12</a></ol>
<dt>&quot;Fine twined&quot; speaks also of unity and consistency of character.<dd>Each thread is distinct, one never interferes with, or mars the beauty of another. Yet, none can be removed without marring the whole. This material was used for the curtains of the Tabernacle (<a href="ex26.htm#1" target="lwr_lt">v.1</a>), the Veil (<a href="ex26.htm#31" target="lwr_lt">v.31</a>), the Door of the Tabernacle (<a href="ex26.htm#36" target="lwr_lt">v.36</a>), the Gate of the Court (<a href="ex27.htm#16">27:16</a>), the cloths of service and the garments of the high priest (<a href="ex39.htm#1">39:1,2</a>). Thus, Christ alone was seen everywhere and in all.
<dt>...with cherubim -<dd>Upon the inner Covering of the Tabernacle, and upon the Veil, were embroidered depictions of cherubim. Thus, within the Most Holy Place, the heavenly reality was modeled, with Cherubim &quot;in the midst of the throne, and round about the throne,&quot; guarding and proclaiming the holiness of God. (cp. <a href="ex25.htm#18">Ex 25:18</a>; <a href="isa6.htm#1">Isa 6:1-3</a>; <a href="rev4.htm#6">Rev 4:6-8</a>).
<dt>taches {ie., hooks, clasps, or couplings} of gold - joined the sections to make one curtain.
<dd>Gold speaks of deity. Because He is God, Christ holds all things together. <a href="col1.htm#16">Col 1:16,17</a></dl><dt>
<b><i>26:7 And thou shalt make curtains [of] goats' [hair] to be a covering upon the tabernacle:<br>eleven curtains shalt thou make.<br>
26:8 The length of one curtain [shall be] thirty cubits, and the breadth of one curtain four cubits:<br>and the eleven curtains [shall be all] of one measure.<br>
26:9 And thou shalt couple five curtains by themselves, and six curtains by themselves,<br>and shalt double the sixth curtain in the forefront of the tabernacle.<br>
26:10 And thou shalt make fifty loops on the edge of the one curtain [that is] outmost in the coupling,<br>and fifty loops in the edge of the curtain which coupleth the second.<br>
26:11 And thou shalt make fifty taches of brass, and put the taches into the loops,<br>and couple the tent together, that it may be one.<br>
26:12 And the remnant that remaineth of the curtains of the tent,<br>the half curtain that remaineth, shall hang over the backside of the tabernacle.<br>
26:13 And a cubit on the one side, and a cubit on the other side<br>of that which remaineth in the length of the curtains of the tent,<br>it shall hang over the sides of the tabernacle on this side and on that side, to cover it.</i></b></dt><dl>
<dt>The second layer of Coverings was of goats' <i>hair</i> (not skins).-
<dd>This was obtained by shearing living animals, and reminds us of the Scapegoat, which bore the sins of the people away &quot;into a land not inhabited&quot; on the Day of Atonement. The truth pictured here is that, in Christ, the believer has been totally separated from his sins, which have been &quot;put away.&quot; cp. <a href="lev16.htm#21">Lev 16:21,22</a>; <a href="heb9.htm#25">Heb 9:25,26</a>; <a href="heb10.htm#17">10:17</a>; <a href="psa103.htm#12">Psa 103:12</a>; <a href="rom8.htm#33">Rom 8:33,34</a>; <a href="gal2.htm#20">Gal 2:20</a>
<dt>taches {ie., couplings} of brass- Brass speaks of judgment.<dd>The One, who holds all things together, has borne our judgment. <a href="col1.htm#14">Col 1:14-22</a></dl><dt>
<b><i>26:14 And thou shalt make a covering for the tent [of] rams' skins dyed red,<br>and a covering above [of] badgers' skins.</i></b></dt><dl>
<dt>The covering of ram <i>skins</i> dyed red - 
<dd>The 'ram' suggests 'determination.' The 'skins dyed red' speak of sacrificial death.<br>
Christ, who was determined to do and to finish the Father's will, accomplished our salvation.<br>cp. <a href="joh4.htm#34">Joh 4:34</a>; <a href="joh8.htm#29">8:29</a>; <a href="php2.htm#8">Php 2:8</a>; <a href="joh19.htm#30">Joh 19:30</a>
<dt>The outer covering of badgers' skins -  
<dd>This protective layer was rough, heavy and weather worn, with no beauty of its own.
<dd>Viewing this outer covering, who would imagine the treasures within? cp. <a href="isa53.htm#2">Isa 53:2</a><br>This refers, not to Christ's physical appearance, but to His humiliation (<a href="php2.htm#6">Php 2:6-8</a>).</dl>
<dt><dt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Boards of the Tabernacle (<a href="ex26.htm#15" target="lwr_lt">v.15-30</a>) -
<dt><b><i>26:15 And thou shalt make boards for the tabernacle [of] shittim wood standing up.<br>
26:16 Ten cubits [shall be] the length of a board,<br>and a cubit and a half [shall be] the breadth of one board.<br>
26:17 Two tenons [shall there be] in one board, set in order one against another:<br>thus shalt thou make for all the boards of the tabernacle.<br>
26:18 And thou shalt make the boards for the tabernacle,<br>twenty boards on the south side southward.<br>
26:19 And thou shalt make forty sockets of silver under the twenty boards;<br>two sockets under one board for his two tenons,<br>and two sockets under another board for his two tenons.<br>
26:20 And for the second side of the tabernacle on the north side [there shall be] twenty boards:<br>
26:21 And their forty sockets [of] silver; two sockets under one board,<br>and two sockets under another board.<br>
26:22 And for the sides of the tabernacle westward thou shalt make six boards.<br>
26:23 And two boards shalt thou make for the corners of the tabernacle in the two sides.<br>
26:24 And they shall be coupled together beneath,<br>and they shall be coupled together above the head of it unto one ring:<br>thus shall it be for them both; they shall be for the two corners.<br>
26:25 And they shall be eight boards, and their sockets [of] silver, sixteen sockets;<br>two sockets under one board, and two sockets under another board.<br>
26:26 And thou shalt make bars [of] shittim wood;<br>five for the boards of the one side of the tabernacle,<br>
26:27 And five bars for the boards of the other side of the tabernacle,<br>and five bars for the boards of the side of the tabernacle, for the two sides westward.<br>
26:28 And the middle bar in the midst of the boards shall reach from end to end.<br>
26:29 And thou shalt overlay the boards with gold,<br>and make their rings [of] gold [for] places for the bars:<br>and thou shalt overlay the bars with gold.<br>
26:30 And thou shalt rear up the tabernacle<br>according to the fashion thereof which was shewed thee in the mount.</i></b></dt><dl>
<dt>The walls of the tabernacle were formed of boards...<ul>
<li>of wood overlaid with gold - Again speaking of the Person of Christ, the God-man.<dd>The many interlocking pieces also speak of His Body, the Church,</dd><dd>made up of individual believers which are joined together with Him in His glory. cp. <a href="eph2.htm#21">Eph 2:21,22</a>; <a href="joh17.htm#21">Joh 17:21-23</a></dd>
<li>joined with bars of wood overlaid with gold -<dd>The unity of the Church is secured by the Holy Spirit (<a href="1cor12.htm#13">1Cor 12:13</a>),</dd><dd>and furthered by His working through human instruments (<a href="eph4.htm#4">Eph 4:4,11-16</a>).</dd>
<li>standing up - The boards stand side by side, vertically. cp. <a href="rom5.htm#2">Rom 5:2</a>; <a href="rev3.htm#12">Rev 3:12</a>
<li>on sockets of silver - Silver speaks of redemption (note the source of this silver in <a href="ex30.htm#11">Ex 30:11-16</a>).<br>
Each board stood upon the earth, yet, separated from it. Likewise, the believer. <a href="joh17.htm#14">Joh 17:14-16</a><br>
Each board rested on <i>two</i> sockets. Possible applications:<ol type="a"><li>Christ the &quot;one foundation&quot; (<a href="1cor3.htm#11">1Cor 3:11</a>), is both <i>faithful</i> and <i>true</i> (<a href="rev19.htm#11">Rev 19:11</a>).<li>Each believer rest on Him, through a combination of <i>grace</i> with <i>faith</i>.<br>ie., The <i>truth</i> of the Gospel must be <i>received</i>. <a href="rom5.htm#2">Rom 5:2</a><li>The basis of the Gospel is both the bodily <i>death</i> and <i>resurrection</i> of Christ. <a href="1cor15.htm#1">1Cor 15:1-4</a></ol>
<li>secured on the foundation sockets by two tenons (<a href="ex26.htm#17" target="lwr_lt">v.17,19</a>) -<dd>Each board had two posts which engaged the two sockets.</dd><dd>The word for 'tenons' {HB= yad, 'hands'}, reminds us that the salvation and standing of each believer is firmly secured. <a href="joh10.htm#27">Joh 10:27-30</a></dd></ul></dl>
<dt><dt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Veil of the Tabernacle (<a href="ex26.htm#31" target="lwr_lt">v.31-35</a>) -
<dt><i><b>26:31 And thou shalt make a vail [of] blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen<br>of cunning work: with cherubims shall it be made:<br>
26:32 And thou shalt hang it upon four pillars of shittim [wood] overlaid with gold:<br>their hooks [shall be of] gold, upon the four sockets of silver.<br>
26:33 And thou shalt hang up the vail under the taches,<br>that thou mayest bring in thither within the vail the ark of the testimony:<br>and the vail shall divide unto you between the holy [place] and the most holy.<br>
26:34 And thou shalt put the mercy seat upon the ark of the testimony in the most holy [place].<br>
26:35 And thou shalt set the table without the vail,<br>and the candlestick over against the table on the side of the tabernacle toward the south:<br>and thou shalt put the table on the north side.</b></i></dt><dl>
<dt>The Veil - 
<dd>Its fabric, like that of the inner covering, which formed the ceiling of the Holy<br>and Most Holy places, speaks of Christ, and of the Holiness of God's Presence.<br>
Yet, it blocked access to the Most Holy Place, and to the Mercy-seat.<br>
Christ's flesh also veiled His glory while He 'tabernacled' among us. <a href="joh1.htm#14">Joh 1:14</a><br>
At His death, the Veil was torn from top to bottom, providing access into the Presence of God, for all who are in Him (<a href="mat27.htm#50">Mat 27:50,51</a>; <a href="heb10.htm#19">Heb 10:19-22</a>)</dl>
<dt><dt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Door of the Tabernacle (<a href="ex26.htm#36" target="lwr_lt">v.36-37</a>) -
<dt><i><b>26:36 And thou shalt make an hanging for the door of the tent,<br>[of] blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen, wrought with needlework.<br>
26:37 And thou shalt make for the hanging five pillars [of] shittim [wood], and overlay them with gold,<br>[and] their hooks [shall be of] gold: and thou shalt cast five sockets of brass for them.</b></i></dt><dl>
<dt>The Door of the Tabernacle was made of the same fabric which speaks of Christ. 
<dd>As used in the doors, we see that Christ forms the only doorway to relationship with God. Through Him, we begin to approach, and through Him our knowledge is deepened, as we move from glory to glory. <a href="joh14.htm#6">Joh 14:6</a>; <a href="2cor3.htm#15">2Cor 3:15-18</a>
<dt>Brass sockets supported the pillars of the Door. 
<dd>Brass speaks of judgment (as will be seen in ch. 27), and suggests<br>the present need for the believer's self-judgment as a prerequisite to fellowship with God (<a href="1cor11.htm#28">1Cor 11:28-32</a>), and also the future judgment of believers in heaven (<a href="2cor5.htm#10">2Cor 5:10</a>).
