Jonah   2<br> 1. Then Jonah prayed unto the LORD his God out of the fish's belly,<br><a name="2">2</a>  And said, I cried by reason of mine affliction unto the LORD, and he heard me; out of the belly of hell cried I, [and] thou heardest my voice.<br><a name="3">3</a>  For thou hadst cast me into the deep, in the midst of the seas; and the floods compassed me about: all thy billows and thy waves passed over me.<br><a name="4">4</a>  Then I said, I am cast out of thy sight; yet I will look again toward thy holy temple.<br><a name="5">5</a>  The waters compassed me about, [even] to the soul: the depth closed me round about, the weeds were wrapped about my head.<br><a name="6">6</a>  I went down to the bottoms of the mountains; the earth with her bars [was] about me for ever: yet hast thou brought up my life from corruption, O LORD my God.<br><a name="7">7</a>  When my soul fainted within me I remembered the LORD: and my prayer came in unto thee, into thine holy temple.<br><a name="8">8</a>  They that observe lying vanities forsake their own mercy.<br><a name="9">9</a>  But I will sacrifice unto thee with the voice of thanksgiving; I will pay [that] that I have vowed. Salvation [is] of the LORD.<br><a name="10">10</a>. And the LORD spake unto the fish, and it vomited out Jonah upon the dry [land].<br><br>Go to <a href="jon3.htm#1">Jonah 3</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
