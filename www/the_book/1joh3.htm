1John   3<br>1. Behold, what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us, that we should be called the sons of God: therefore the world knoweth us not, because it knew him not.<br><a name="2">2</a>  Beloved, now are we the sons of God, and it doth not yet appear what we shall be: but we know that, when he shall appear, we shall be like him; for we shall see him as he is.<br><a name="3">3</a>  And every man that hath this hope in him purifieth himself, even as he is pure.<br><a name="4">4</a>. Whosoever committeth sin transgresseth also the law: for sin is the transgression of the law.<br><a name="5">5</a>  And ye know that he was manifested to take away our sins; and in him is no sin.<br><a name="6">6</a>  Whosoever abideth in him sinneth not: whosoever sinneth hath not seen him, neither known him.<br><a name="7">7</a>  Little children, let no man deceive you: he that doeth righteousness is righteous, even as he is righteous.<br><a name="8">8</a>  He that committeth sin is of the devil; for the devil sinneth from the beginning. For this purpose the Son of God was manifested, that he might destroy the works of the devil.<br><a name="9">9</a>  Whosoever is born of God doth not commit sin; for his seed remaineth in him: and he cannot sin, because he is born of God.<br><a name="10">10</a>  In this the children of God are manifest, and the children of the devil: whosoever doeth not righteousness is not of God, neither he that loveth not his brother.<br><a name="11">11</a>. For this is the message that ye heard from the beginning, that we should love one another.<br><a name="12">12</a>  Not as Cain, [who] was of that wicked one, and slew his brother. And wherefore slew he him? Because his own works were evil, and his brother's righteous.<br><a name="13">13</a>  Marvel not, my brethren, if the world hate you.<br><a name="14">14</a>. We know that we have passed from death unto life, because we love the brethren. He that loveth not [his] brother abideth in death.<br><a name="15">15</a>  Whosoever hateth his brother is a murderer: and ye know that no murderer hath eternal life abiding in him.<br><a name="16">16</a>  Hereby perceive we the love [of God], because he laid down his life for us: and we ought to lay down [our] lives for the brethren.<br><a name="17">17</a>  But whoso hath this world's good, and seeth his brother have need, and shutteth up his bowels [of compassion] from him, how dwelleth the love of God in him?<br><a name="18">18</a>  My little children, let us not love in word, neither in tongue; but in deed and in truth.<br><a name="19">19</a>  And hereby we know that we are of the truth, and shall assure our hearts before him.<br><a name="20">20</a>. For if our heart condemn us, God is greater than our heart, and knoweth all things.<br><a name="21">21</a>  Beloved, if our heart condemn us not, [then] have we confidence toward God.<br><a name="22">22</a>  And whatsoever we ask, we receive of him, because we keep his commandments, and do those things that are pleasing in his sight.<br><a name="23">23</a>. And this is his commandment, That we should believe on the name of his Son Jesus Christ, and love one another, as he gave us commandment.<br><a name="24">24</a>  And he that keepeth his commandments dwelleth in him, and he in him. And hereby we know that he abideth in us, by the Spirit which he hath given us.<br><br>Go to <a href="1joh4.htm#1">I John 4</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
