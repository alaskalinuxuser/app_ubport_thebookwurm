<h3><i>Hunger and Thirst (Exodus 16,17)</i></h3></center>
<b><ol type="A">
<li>Tested by hunger</b><ol type="1">
<li>The murmuring people<ul>
<li><a href="ex16.htm#2">Exodus 16:2,3</a> -- &quot;Would to God we had died... when we did eat bread to the full&quot;
<li><a href="num11.htm#4">Numbers 11:4,5</a> -- &quot;We remember the fish... cucumbers, and the melons, and the leeks, and the onions, and the garlick&quot;</ul>
<li>The answer of grace<ul>
<li><a href="ex16.htm#4">Exodus 16:4</a> -- &quot;Behold, I will rain bread from heaven for you&quot;</ul><p>Manna is a wonderful picture of Christ, as the &quot;Bread of Life.&quot;</p><ul>
<li><a href="joh6.htm#32">John 6:32,33</a> -- &quot;The true bread... He which cometh down from heaven, and giveth life&quot;
<li><a href="joh6.htm#48">John 6:48</a> -- &quot;I am that Bread of Life&quot;</ul>
<p>Just like the manna, He seemed &quot;a small... thing&quot; (<a href="ex16.htm#14">Exodus 16:14</a>), but He had the Spirit's fullness. Every precious word that fell from His lips &quot;was as the taste of fresh oil&quot; (<a href="num11.htm#8">Numbers 11:8</a>). He is the food of every believer who meditates upon Him and His words.</p></ol><b>
<li>Tested by thirst</b><ol type="1">
<li>The people's response<ul>
<li><a href="ex17.htm#1">Exodus 17:1</a> -- &quot;There was no water&quot;
<li><a href="ex17.htm#3">Exodus 17:3</a> -- &quot;And the people murmured&quot;</ul>
<li>The answer of grace<ul>
<li><a href="ex17.htm#2">Exodus 17:2</a> -- &quot;Wherefore do ye tempt the Lord?&quot;
<li><a href="ex17.htm#5">Exodus 17:5,6</a> -- &quot;There shall come water out of it, that the people may drink&quot;
<li><a href="1cor10.htm#4">1Corinthians 10:4</a> -- &quot;That Rock was Christ&quot;
<li><a href="eph2.htm#1">Ephesians 2:1-6</a> -- &quot;You hath He quickened [made alive]... children of disobedience&quot;</ul><p>Again, a wonderful and lovely type of Christ as the giver of &quot;the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus&quot; (<a href="rom8.htm#2">Romans 8:2</a>) to an unworthy but needy people.</p>
<li>Life through grace<ul>
<li><a href="joh4.htm#10">John 4:10</a> -- &quot;He would have given thee living water.&quot;<br>A free gift (compare <a href="rom6.htm#23">Romans 6:23</a> and <a href="eph2.htm#8">Ephesians 2:8</a>).
<li><a href="rom5.htm#20">Romans 5:20</a> -- &quot;Grace did much more abound.&quot; An abundant gift.</ul>
<li>Bestowed by the Spirit<ul>
<li><a href="joh4.htm#14">John 4:14</a> -- &quot;The water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life&quot;</ul></ol></ol>
