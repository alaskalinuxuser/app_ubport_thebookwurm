Job   5<br>1. Call now, if there be any that will answer thee; and to which of the saints wilt thou turn?<br><a name="2">2</a>  For wrath killeth the foolish man, and envy slayeth the silly one.<br><a name="3">3</a>  I have seen the foolish taking root: but suddenly I cursed his habitation.<br><a name="4">4</a>  His children are far from safety, and they are crushed in the gate, neither [is there] any to deliver [them].<br><a name="5">5</a>  Whose harvest the hungry eateth up, and taketh it even out of the thorns, and the robber swalloweth up their substance.<br><a name="6">6</a>. Although affliction cometh not forth of the dust, neither doth trouble spring out of the ground;<br><a name="7">7</a>  Yet man is born unto trouble, as the sparks fly upward.<br><a name="8">8</a>  I would seek unto God, and unto God would I commit my cause:<br><a name="9">9</a>  Which doeth great things and unsearchable; marvellous things without number:<br><a name="10">10</a>  Who giveth rain upon the earth, and sendeth waters upon the fields:<br><a name="11">11</a>  To set up on high those that be low; that those which mourn may be exalted to safety.<br><a name="12">12</a>  He disappointeth the devices of the crafty, so that their hands cannot perform [their] enterprise.<br><a name="13">13</a>  He taketh the wise in their own craftiness: and the counsel of the froward is carried headlong.<br><a name="14">14</a>  They meet with darkness in the daytime, and grope in the noonday as in the night.<br><a name="15">15</a>  But he saveth the poor from the sword, from their mouth, and from the hand of the mighty.<br><a name="16">16</a>  So the poor hath hope, and iniquity stoppeth her mouth.<br><a name="17">17</a>. Behold, happy [is] the man whom God correcteth: therefore despise not thou the chastening of the Almighty:<br><a name="18">18</a>  For he maketh sore, and bindeth up: he woundeth, and his hands make whole.<br><a name="19">19</a>  He shall deliver thee in six troubles: yea, in seven there shall no evil touch thee.<br><a name="20">20</a>  In famine he shall redeem thee from death: and in war from the power of the sword.<br><a name="21">21</a>  Thou shalt be hid from the scourge of the tongue: neither shalt thou be afraid of destruction when it cometh.<br><a name="22">22</a>  At destruction and famine thou shalt laugh: neither shalt thou be afraid of the beasts of the earth.<br><a name="23">23</a>  For thou shalt be in league with the stones of the field: and the beasts of the field shall be at peace with thee.<br><a name="24">24</a>  And thou shalt know that thy tabernacle [shall be] in peace; and thou shalt visit thy habitation, and shalt not sin.<br><a name="25">25</a>  Thou shalt know also that thy seed [shall be] great, and thine offspring as the grass of the earth.<br><a name="26">26</a>  Thou shalt come to [thy] grave in a full age, like as a shock of corn cometh in in his season.<br><a name="27">27</a>  Lo this, we have searched it, so it [is]; hear it, and know thou [it] for thy good.<br><br>Go to <a href="job6.htm#1">Job 6</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
