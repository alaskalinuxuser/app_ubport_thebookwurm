Proverbs   5<br>1. My son, attend unto my wisdom, [and] bow thine ear to my understanding:<br><a name="2">2</a>  That thou mayest regard discretion, and [that] thy lips may keep knowledge.<br><a name="3">3</a>  For the lips of a strange woman drop [as] an honeycomb, and her mouth [is] smoother than oil:<br><a name="4">4</a>  But her end is bitter as wormwood, sharp as a twoedged sword.<br><a name="5">5</a>  Her feet go down to death; her steps take hold on hell.<br><a name="6">6</a>  Lest thou shouldest ponder the path of life, her ways are moveable, [that] thou canst not know [them].<br><a name="7">7</a>  Hear me now therefore, O ye children, and depart not from the words of my mouth.<br><a name="8">8</a>  Remove thy way far from her, and come not nigh the door of her house:<br><a name="9">9</a>  Lest thou give thine honour unto others, and thy years unto the cruel:<br><a name="10">10</a>  Lest strangers be filled with thy wealth; and thy labours [be] in the house of a stranger;<br><a name="11">11</a>  And thou mourn at the last, when thy flesh and thy body are consumed,<br><a name="12">12</a>  And say, How have I hated instruction, and my heart despised reproof;<br><a name="13">13</a>  And have not obeyed the voice of my teachers, nor inclined mine ear to them that instructed me!<br><a name="14">14</a>  I was almost in all evil in the midst of the congregation and assembly.<br><a name="15">15</a>. Drink waters out of thine own cistern, and running waters out of thine own well.<br><a name="16">16</a>  Let thy fountains be dispersed abroad, [and] rivers of waters in the streets.<br><a name="17">17</a>  Let them be only thine own, and not strangers' with thee.<br><a name="18">18</a>  Let thy fountain be blessed: and rejoice with the wife of thy youth.<br><a name="19">19</a>  [Let her be as] the loving hind and pleasant roe; let her breasts satisfy thee at all times; and be thou ravished always with her love.<br><a name="20">20</a>  And why wilt thou, my son, be ravished with a strange woman, and embrace the bosom of a stranger?<br><a name="21">21</a>  For the ways of man [are] before the eyes of the LORD, and he pondereth all his goings.<br><a name="22">22</a>  His own iniquities shall take the wicked himself, and he shall be holden with the cords of his sins.<br><a name="23">23</a>  He shall die without instruction; and in the greatness of his folly he shall go astray.<br><br>Go to <a href="pro6.htm#1">Proverbs 6</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
