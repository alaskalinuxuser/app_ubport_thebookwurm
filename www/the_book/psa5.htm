Psalms   5<br> 1. To the chief Musician upon Nehiloth, A Psalm of David. Give ear to my words, O LORD, consider my meditation.<br><a name="2">2</a>  Hearken unto the voice of my cry, my King, and my God: for unto thee will I pray.<br><a name="3">3</a>  My voice shalt thou hear in the morning, O LORD; in the morning will I direct [my prayer] unto thee, and will look up.<br><a name="4">4</a>  For thou [art] not a God that hath pleasure in wickedness: neither shall evil dwell with thee.<br><a name="5">5</a>  The foolish shall not stand in thy sight: thou hatest all workers of iniquity.<br><a name="6">6</a>  Thou shalt destroy them that speak leasing: the LORD will abhor the bloody and deceitful man.<br><a name="7">7</a>. But as for me, I will come [into] thy house in the multitude of thy mercy: [and] in thy fear will I worship toward thy holy temple.<br><a name="8">8</a>  Lead me, O LORD, in thy righteousness because of mine enemies; make thy way straight before my face.<br><a name="9">9</a>  For [there is] no faithfulness in their mouth; their inward part [is] very wickedness; their throat [is] an open sepulchre; they flatter with their tongue.<br><a name="10">10</a>  Destroy thou them, O God; let them fall by their own counsels; cast them out in the multitude of their transgressions; for they have rebelled against thee.<br><a name="11">11</a>  But let all those that put their trust in thee rejoice: let them ever shout for joy, because thou defendest them: let them also that love thy name be joyful in thee.<br><a name="12">12</a>  For thou, LORD, wilt bless the righteous; with favour wilt thou compass him as [with] a shield.<br><br>Go to <a href="psa6.htm#1">Psalm 6</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
