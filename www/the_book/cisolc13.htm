by C.I. Scofield
<h2>The Church</h2></center>
<b><ol type="A">
<li>What is the Church?</b><ol type="1">
<li>The word <i>ecclesia</i> (translated 'church') means &quot;the called out assembly.&quot;<ul>
<li><a href="eph1.htm#22">Ephesians 1:22</a> - &quot;Gave Him to be the Head over... the church, which is His body&quot;
<li><a href="eph2.htm#21">Ephesians 2:21,22</a> - &quot;An holy temple in the Lord: in whom ye also are builded together for an habitation of God through the Spirit&quot;</ul>
The Church is not a [physical] building. It is made up of all believers, with Christ as its Head.<br>
<li>A dwelling place for God<ol type="a">
<li>Old Testament<ul>
<li><a href="ex40.htm#34">Exodus 40:34,35</a> - &quot;The glory of the Lord filled the tabernacle.&quot; This was Jehovah's habitation through the shekinah (or, cloud of glory).</ul>
<li>New Testament<ul>
<li><a href="mat18.htm#20">Matthew 18:20</a> - &quot;Where two or three are gathered together in My name, there am I in the midst of them.&quot; Now He dwells in gathered believers through the Holy Spirit.</ul></ol></ol><b>
<li>How the Church is formed</b><ul>
<li><a href="1cor12.htm#12">1Corinthians 12:12</a> - &quot;All the members... being many, are one body&quot;
<li><a href="1cor12.htm#13">1Corinthians 12:13</a> - &quot;By one Spirit are we all baptized into one body&quot;
<li><a href="eph2.htm#22">Ephesians 2:22</a> - &quot;Builded together for an habitation of God through the Spirit&quot;
<li><a href="Act2.htm#47">Acts 2:47</a> - &quot;Added to the church daily such as should be saved&quot;</ul><b>
<li>When the Church began</b><ul>
<li><a href="mat16.htm#18">Matthew 16:18</a> - &quot;I will build My church.&quot; The church, therefore, was yet future when Christ spoke.
<li><a href="eph3.htm#9">Ephesians 3:9</a> - &quot;The mystery, which from the beginning of the world hath been hid in God&quot;
<li><a href="1cor12.htm#12">1Corinthians 12:12,13</a> - &quot;By one Spirit... baptized into one body&quot;
<li><a href="act1.htm#5">Acts 1:5,8</a> - &quot;Baptized with the Holy Ghost not many days hence&quot;<br>
The church began when the believers were baptized into one body at Pentecost. The disciples and the first converts are, for the first time, called &quot;the church.&quot;</ul><b>
<li>The mission of the Church</b><ul>
<li><a href="act1.htm#8">Acts 1:8</a> - &quot;Receive power... be witnesses... uttermost part of the earth&quot;</ul><b>
<li>The attitude and expectation of the Church</b><ul>
<li><a href="1the1.htm#9">1Thessalonians 1:9,10</a> - &quot;Ye turned... to serve... and to wait for His Son from heaven&quot;
<li><a href="tit2.htm#12">Titus 2:12,13</a> - &quot;We should live soberly, righteously, and godly... looking for the blessed hope&quot;
<li><a href="1the4.htm#14">1Thessalonians 4:14-17</a> - &quot;Caught up... to meet the Lord in the air&quot;</ul>
<p>The whole number of believers from Pentecost to the event predicted in <a href="1the4.htm#14">1Thessalonians 4:14-17</a>, forms &quot;the church, which is His body&quot; (<a href="eph1.htm#22">Ephesians 1:22,23</a>). It is formed by the baptism with the Spirit (<a href="1cor12.htm#12">1Corinthians 12:12,13</a>), and is an organism, not an organization. This is the true or <i>invisible</i> church.</p>
<p>The word is also used of any &quot;called-out&quot; assembly, such as a town meeting in Ephesus (<a href="act19.htm#32">Acts 19:32</a>). In the plural, <i>churches,</i> the word is used of local assemblies of professed believers on the Lord Jesus Christ, who gather themselves together in His name for worship and service.</p></ol>
