2Samuel   1<br>1. Now it came to pass after the death of Saul, when David was returned from the slaughter of the Amalekites, and David had abode two days in Ziklag;<br><a name="2">2</a>  It came even to pass on the third day, that, behold, a man came out of the camp from Saul with his clothes rent, and earth upon his head: and [so] it was, when he came to David, that he fell to the earth, and did obeisance.<br><a name="3">3</a>  And David said unto him, From whence comest thou? And he said unto him, Out of the camp of Israel am I escaped.<br><a name="4">4</a>  And David said unto him, How went the matter? I pray thee, tell me. And he answered, That the people are fled from the battle, and many of the people also are fallen and dead; and Saul and Jonathan his son are dead also.<br><a name="5">5</a>  And David said unto the young man that told him, How knowest thou that Saul and Jonathan his son be dead?<br><a name="6">6</a>  And the young man that told him said, As I happened by chance upon mount Gilboa, behold, Saul leaned upon his spear; and, lo, the chariots and horsemen followed hard after him.<br><a name="7">7</a>  And when he looked behind him, he saw me, and called unto me. And I answered, Here [am] I.<br><a name="8">8</a>  And he said unto me, Who [art] thou? And I answered him, I [am] an Amalekite.<br><a name="9">9</a>  He said unto me again, Stand, I pray thee, upon me, and slay me: for anguish is come upon me, because my life [is] yet whole in me.<br><a name="10">10</a>  So I stood upon him, and slew him, because I was sure that he could not live after that he was fallen: and I took the crown that [was] upon his head, and the bracelet that [was] on his arm, and have brought them hither unto my lord.<br><a name="11">11</a>. Then David took hold on his clothes, and rent them; and likewise all the men that [were] with him:<br><a name="12">12</a>  And they mourned, and wept, and fasted until even, for Saul, and for Jonathan his son, and for the people of the LORD, and for the house of Israel; because they were fallen by the sword.<br><a name="13">13</a>  And David said unto the young man that told him, Whence [art] thou? And he answered, I [am] the son of a stranger, an Amalekite.<br><a name="14">14</a>  And David said unto him, How wast thou not afraid to stretch forth thine hand to destroy the LORD'S anointed?<br><a name="15">15</a>  And David called one of the young men, and said, Go near, [and] fall upon him. And he smote him that he died.<br><a name="16">16</a>  And David said unto him, Thy blood [be] upon thy head; for thy mouth hath testified against thee, saying, I have slain the LORD'S anointed.<br><a name="17">17</a>. And David lamented with this lamentation over Saul and over Jonathan his son:<br><a name="18">18</a>  (Also he bade them teach the children of Judah [the use of] the bow: behold, [it is] written in the book of Jasher.)<br><a name="19">19</a>  The beauty of Israel is slain upon thy high places: how are the mighty fallen!<br><a name="20">20</a>  Tell [it] not in Gath, publish [it] not in the streets of Askelon; lest the daughters of the Philistines rejoice, lest the daughters of the uncircumcised triumph.<br><a name="21">21</a>  Ye mountains of Gilboa, [let there be] no dew, neither [let there be] rain, upon you, nor fields of offerings: for there the shield of the mighty is vilely cast away, the shield of Saul, [as though he had] not [been] anointed with oil.<br><a name="22">22</a>  From the blood of the slain, from the fat of the mighty, the bow of Jonathan turned not back, and the sword of Saul returned not empty.<br><a name="23">23</a>  Saul and Jonathan [were] lovely and pleasant in their lives, and in their death they were not divided: they were swifter than eagles, they were stronger than lions.<br><a name="24">24</a>  Ye daughters of Israel, weep over Saul, who clothed you in scarlet, with [other] delights, who put on ornaments of gold upon your apparel.<br><a name="25">25</a>  How are the mighty fallen in the midst of the battle! O Jonathan, [thou wast] slain in thine high places.<br><a name="26">26</a>  I am distressed for thee, my brother Jonathan: very pleasant hast thou been unto me: thy love to me was wonderful, passing the love of women.<br><a name="27">27</a>  How are the mighty fallen, and the weapons of war perished!<br><br>Go to <a href="2sam2.htm#1">II Samuel 2</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
