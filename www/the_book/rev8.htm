Revelation   8<br> 1. And when he had opened the seventh seal, there was silence in heaven about the space of half an hour.<br><a name="2">2</a>  And I saw the seven angels which stood before God; and to them were given seven trumpets.<br><a name="3">3</a>  And another angel came and stood at the altar, having a golden censer; and there was given unto him much incense, that he should offer [it] with the prayers of all saints upon the golden altar which was before the throne.<br><a name="4">4</a>  And the smoke of the incense, [which came] with the prayers of the saints, ascended up before God out of the angel's hand.<br><a name="5">5</a>  And the angel took the censer, and filled it with fire of the altar, and cast [it] into the earth: and there were voices, and thunderings, and lightnings, and an earthquake.<br><a name="6">6</a>  And the seven angels which had the seven trumpets prepared themselves to sound.<br><a name="7">7</a>.
