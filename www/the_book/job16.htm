Job  16<br>1. Then Job answered and said,<br><a name="2">2</a>  I have heard many such things: miserable comforters [are] ye all.<br><a name="3">3</a>  Shall vain words have an end? or what emboldeneth thee that thou answerest?<br><a name="4">4</a>  I also could speak as ye [do]: if your soul were in my soul's stead, I could heap up words against you, and shake mine head at you.<br><a name="5">5</a>  [But] I would strengthen you with my mouth, and the moving of my lips should asswage [your grief].<br><a name="6">6</a>. Though I speak, my grief is not asswaged: and [though] I forbear, what am I eased?<br><a name="7">7</a>  But now he hath made me weary: thou hast made desolate all my company.<br><a name="8">8</a>  And thou hast filled me with wrinkles, [which] is a witness [against me]: and my leanness rising up in me beareth witness to my face.<br><a name="9">9</a>  He teareth [me] in his wrath, who hateth me: he gnasheth upon me with his teeth; mine enemy sharpeneth his eyes upon me.<br><a name="10">10</a>  They have gaped upon me with their mouth; they have smitten me upon the cheek reproachfully; they have gathered themselves together against me.<br><a name="11">11</a>  God hath delivered me to the ungodly, and turned me over into the hands of the wicked.<br><a name="12">12</a>  I was at ease, but he hath broken me asunder: he hath also taken [me] by my neck, and shaken me to pieces, and set me up for his mark.<br><a name="13">13</a>  His archers compass me round about, he cleaveth my reins asunder, and doth not spare; he poureth out my gall upon the ground.<br><a name="14">14</a>  He breaketh me with breach upon breach, he runneth upon me like a giant.<br><a name="15">15</a>  I have sewed sackcloth upon my skin, and defiled my horn in the dust.<br><a name="16">16</a>  My face is foul with weeping, and on my eyelids [is] the shadow of death;<br><a name="17">17</a>. Not for [any] injustice in mine hands: also my prayer [is] pure.<br><a name="18">18</a>  O earth, cover not thou my blood, and let my cry have no place.<br><a name="19">19</a>  Also now, behold, my witness [is] in heaven, and my record [is] on high.<br><a name="20">20</a>  My friends scorn me: [but] mine eye poureth out [tears] unto God.<br><a name="21">21</a>  O that one might plead for a man with God, as a man [pleadeth] for his neighbour!<br><a name="22">22</a>  When a few years are come, then I shall go the way [whence] I shall not return.<br><br>Go to <a href="job17.htm#1">Job 17</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
