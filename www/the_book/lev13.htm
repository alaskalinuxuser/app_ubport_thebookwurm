And the LORD spake unto Moses and Aaron, saying,<br><a name="2">2</a>  When a man shall have in the skin of his flesh a rising, a scab, or bright spot, and it be in the skin of his flesh [like] the plague of leprosy; then he shall be brought unto Aaron the priest, or unto one of his sons the priests:<br><a name="3">3</a>  And the priest shall look on the plague in the skin of the flesh: and [when] the hair in the plague is turned white, and the plague in sight [be] deeper than the skin of his flesh, it [is] a plague of leprosy: and the priest shall look on him, and pronounce him unclean.<br><a name="4">4</a>  If the bright spot [be] white in the skin of his flesh, and in sight [be] not deeper than the skin, and the hair thereof be not turned white; then the priest shall shut up [him that hath] the plague seven days:<br><a name="5">5</a>  And the priest shall look on him the seventh day: and, behold, [if] the plague in his sight be at a stay, [and] the plague spread not in the skin; then the priest shall shut him up seven days more:<br><a name="6">6</a>  And the priest shall look on him again the seventh day: and, behold, [if] the plague [be] somewhat dark, [and] the plague spread not in the skin, the priest shall pronounce him clean: it [is but] a scab: and he shall wash his clothes, and be clean.<br><a name="7">7</a>  But if the scab spread much abroad in the skin, after that he hath been seen of the priest for his cleansing, he shall be seen of the priest again:<br><a name="8">8</a>  And [if] the priest see that, behold, the scab spreadeth in the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it [is] a leprosy.<br><a name="9">9</a>  When the plague of leprosy is in a man, then he shall be brought unto the priest;<br><a name="10">10</a>  And the priest shall see [him]: and, behold, [if] the rising [be] white in the skin, and it have turned the hair white, and [there be] quick raw flesh in the rising;<br><a name="11">11</a>  It [is] an old leprosy in the skin of his flesh, and the priest shall pronounce him unclean, and shall not shut him up: for he [is] unclean.<br><a name="12">12</a>  And if a leprosy break out abroad in the skin, and the leprosy cover all the skin of [him that hath] the plague from his head even to his foot, wheresoever the priest looketh;<br><a name="13">13</a>  Then the priest shall consider: and, behold, [if] the leprosy have covered all his flesh, he shall pronounce [him] clean [that hath] the plague: it is all turned white: he [is] clean.<br><a name="14">14</a>  But when raw flesh appeareth in him, he shall be unclean.<br><a name="15">15</a>  And the priest shall see the raw flesh, and pronounce him to be unclean: [for] the raw flesh [is] unclean: it [is] a leprosy.<br><a name="16">16</a>  Or if the raw flesh turn again, and be changed unto white, he shall come unto the priest;<br><a name="17">17</a>  And the priest shall see him: and, behold, [if] the plague be turned into white; then the priest shall pronounce [him] clean [that hath] the plague: he [is] clean.<br><a name="18">18</a>. The flesh also, in which, [even] in the skin thereof, was a boil, and is healed,<br><a name="19">19</a>  And in the place of the boil there be a white rising, or a bright spot, white, and somewhat reddish, and it be shewed to the priest;<br><a name="20">20</a>  And if, when the priest seeth it, behold, it [be] in sight lower than the skin, and the hair thereof be turned white; the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it [is] a plague of leprosy broken out of the boil.<br><a name="21">21</a>  But if the priest look on it, and, behold, [there be] no white hairs therein, and [if] it [be] not lower than the skin, but [be] somewhat dark; then the priest shall shut him up seven days:<br><a name="22">22</a>  And if it spread much abroad in the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it [is] a plague.<br><a name="23">23</a>  But if the bright spot stay in his place, [and] spread not, it [is] a burning boil; and the priest shall pronounce him clean.<br><a name="24">24</a>  Or if there be [any] flesh, in the skin whereof [there is] a hot burning, and the quick [flesh] that burneth have a white bright spot, somewhat reddish, or white;<br><a name="25">25</a>  Then the priest shall look upon it: and, behold, [if] the hair in the bright spot be turned white, and it [be in] sight deeper than the skin; it [is] a leprosy broken out of the burning: wherefore the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it [is] the plague of leprosy.<br><a name="26">26</a>  But if the priest look on it, and, behold, [there be] no white hair in the bright spot, and it [be] no lower than the [other] skin, but [be] somewhat dark; then the priest shall shut him up seven days:<br><a name="27">27</a>  And the priest shall look upon him the seventh day: [and] if it be spread much abroad in the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it [is] the plague of leprosy.<br><a name="28">28</a>  And if the bright spot stay in his place, [and] spread not in the skin, but it [be] somewhat dark; it [is] a rising of the burning, and the priest shall pronounce him clean: for it [is] an inflammation of the burning.<br><a name="29">29</a>  If a man or woman have a plague upon the head or the beard;<br><a name="30">30</a>  Then the priest shall see the plague: and, behold, if it [be] in sight deeper than the skin; [and there be] in it a yellow thin hair; then the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it [is] a dry scall, [even] a leprosy upon the head or beard.<br><a name="31">31</a>  And if the priest look on the plague of the scall, and, behold, it [be] not in sight deeper than the skin, and [that there is] no black hair in it; then the priest shall shut up [him that hath] the plague of the scall seven days:<br><a name="32">32</a>  And in the seventh day the priest shall look on the plague: and, behold, [if] the scall spread not, and there be in it no yellow hair, and the scall [be] not in sight deeper than the skin;<br><a name="33">33</a>  He shall be shaven, but the scall shall he not shave; and the priest shall shut up [him that hath] the scall seven days more:<br><a name="34">34</a>  And in the seventh day the priest shall look on the scall: and, behold, [if] the scall be not spread in the skin, nor [be] in sight deeper than the skin; then the priest shall pronounce him clean: and he shall wash his clothes, and be clean.<br><a name="35">35</a>  But if the scall spread much in the skin after his cleansing;<br><a name="36">36</a>  Then the priest shall look on him: and, behold, if the scall be spread in the skin, the priest shall not seek for yellow hair; he [is] unclean.<br><a name="37">37</a>  But if the scall be in his sight at a stay, and [that] there is black hair grown up therein; the scall is healed, he [is] clean: and the priest shall pronounce him clean.<br><a name="38"> 38</a>. If a man also or a woman have in the skin of their flesh bright spots, [even] white bright spots;<br><a name="39">39</a>  Then the priest shall look: and, behold, [if] the bright spots in the skin of their flesh [be] darkish white; it [is] a freckled spot [that] groweth in the skin; he [is] clean.<br><a name="40">40</a>  And the man whose hair is fallen off his head, he [is] bald; [yet is] he clean.<br><a name="41">41</a>  And he that hath his hair fallen off from the part of his head toward his face, he [is] forehead bald: [yet is] he clean.<br><a name="42">42</a>  And if there be in the bald head, or bald forehead, a white reddish sore; it [is] a leprosy sprung up in his bald head, or his bald forehead.<br><a name="43">43</a>  Then the priest shall look upon it: and, behold, [if] the rising of the sore [be] white reddish in his bald head, or in his bald forehead, as the leprosy appeareth in the skin of the flesh;<br><a name="44">44</a>  He is a leprous man, he [is] unclean: the priest shall pronounce him utterly unclean; his plague [is] in his head.<br><a name="45">45</a>  And the leper in whom the plague [is], his clothes shall be rent, and his head bare, and he shall put a covering upon his upper lip, and shall cry, Unclean, unclean.<br><a name="46">46</a>  All the days wherein the plague [shall be] in him he shall be defiled; he [is] unclean: he shall dwell alone; without the camp [shall] his habitation [be].<br><a name="47">47</a>. The garment also that the plague of leprosy is in, [whether it be] a woollen garment, or a linen garment;<br><a name="48">48</a>  Whether [it be] in the warp, or woof; of linen, or of woollen; whether in a skin, or in any thing made of skin;<br><a name="49">49</a>  And if the plague be greenish or reddish in the garment, or in the skin, either in the warp, or in the woof, or in any thing of skin; it [is] a plague of leprosy, and shall be shewed unto the priest:<br><a name="50">50</a>  And the priest shall look upon the plague, and shut up [it that hath] the plague seven days:<br><a name="51">51</a>  And he shall look on the plague on the seventh day: if the plague be spread in the garment, either in the warp, or in the woof, or in a skin, [or] in any work that is made of skin; the plague [is] a fretting leprosy; it [is] unclean.<br><a name="52">52</a>  He shall therefore burn that garment, whether warp or woof, in woollen or in linen, or any thing of skin, wherein the plague is: for it [is] a fretting leprosy; it shall be burnt in the fire.<br><a name="53">53</a>  And if the priest shall look, and, behold, the plague be not spread in the garment, either in the warp, or in the woof, or in any thing of skin;<br><a name="54">54</a> Then the priest shall command that they wash [the thing] wherein the plague [is], and he shall shut it up seven days more:<br><a name="55">55</a> And the priest shall look on the plague, after that it is washed: and, behold, [if] the plague have not changed his colour, and the plague be not spread; it [is] unclean; thou shalt burn it in the fire; it [is] fret inward, [whether] it [be] bare within or without.<br><a name="56">56</a> And if the priest look, and, behold, the plague [be] somewhat dark after the washing of it; then he shall rend it out of the garment, or out of the skin, or out of the warp, or out of the woof:<br><a name="57">57</a> And if it appear still in the garment, either in the warp, or in the woof, or in any thing of skin; it [is] a spreading [plague]: thou shalt burn that wherein the plague [is] with fire.<br><a name="58">58</a> And the garment, either warp, or woof, or whatsoever thing of skin [it be], which thou shalt wash, if the plague be departed from them, then it shall be washed the second time, and shall be clean.<br><a name="5">5</a>9  This [is] the law of the plague of leprosy in a garment of woollen or linen, either in the warp, or woof, or any thing of skins, to pronounce it clean, or to pronounce it unclean. <br><br>Go to <a href="lev14.htm#1">Leviticus 14</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
