Isaiah  26<br> 1. In that day shall this song be sung in the land of Judah; We have a strong city; salvation will [God] appoint [for] walls and bulwarks.<br><a name="2">2</a>  Open ye the gates, that the righteous nation which keepeth the truth may enter in.<br><a name="3">3</a>  Thou wilt keep [him] in perfect peace, [whose] mind [is] stayed [on thee]: because he trusteth in thee.<br><a name="4">4</a>  Trust ye in the LORD for ever: for in the LORD JEHOVAH [is] everlasting strength:<br><a name="5">5</a>. For he bringeth down them that dwell on high; the lofty city, he layeth it low; he layeth it low, [even] to the ground; he bringeth it [even] to the dust.<br><a name="6">6</a>  The foot shall tread it down, [even] the feet of the poor, [and] the steps of the needy.<br><a name="7">7</a>  The way of the just [is] uprightness: thou, most upright, dost weigh the path of the just.<br><a name="8">8</a>  Yea, in the way of thy judgments, O LORD, have we waited for thee; the desire of [our] soul [is] to thy name, and to the remembrance of thee.<br><a name="9">9</a>  With my soul have I desired thee in the night; yea, with my spirit within me will I seek thee early: for when thy judgments [are] in the earth, the inhabitants of the world will learn righteousness.<br><a name="10">10</a>  Let favour be shewed to the wicked, [yet] will he not learn righteousness: in the land of uprightness will he deal unjustly, and will not behold the majesty of the LORD.<br><a name="11">11</a>  LORD, [when] thy hand is lifted up, they will not see: [but] they shall see, and be ashamed for [their] envy at the people; yea, the fire of thine enemies shall devour them.<br><a name="12">12</a>. LORD, thou wilt ordain peace for us: for thou also hast wrought all our works in us.<br><a name="13">13</a>  O LORD our God, [other] lords beside thee have had dominion over us: [but] by thee only will we make mention of thy name.<br><a name="14">14</a>  [They are] dead, they shall not live; [they are] deceased, they shall not rise: therefore hast thou visited and destroyed them, and made all their memory to perish.<br><a name="15">15</a>  Thou hast increased the nation, O LORD, thou hast increased the nation: thou art glorified: thou hadst removed [it] far [unto] all the ends of the earth.<br><a name="16">16</a>  LORD, in trouble have they visited thee, they poured out a prayer [when] thy chastening [was] upon them.<br><a name="17">17</a>  Like as a woman with child, [that] draweth near the time of her delivery, is in pain, [and] crieth out in her pangs; so have we been in thy sight, O LORD.<br><a name="18">18</a>  We have been with child, we have been in pain, we have as it were brought forth wind; we have not wrought any deliverance in the earth; neither have the inhabitants of the world fallen.<br><a name="19">19</a>  Thy dead [men] shall live, [together with] my dead body shall they arise. Awake and sing, ye that dwell in dust: for thy dew [is as] the dew of herbs, and the earth shall cast out the dead.<br><a name="20">20</a>. Come, my people, enter thou into thy chambers, and shut thy doors about thee: hide thyself as it were for a little moment, until the indignation be overpast.<br><a name="21">21</a>  For, behold, the LORD cometh out of his place to punish the inhabitants of the earth for their iniquity: the earth also shall disclose her blood, and shall no more cover her slain.<br><br>Go to <a href="isa27.htm#1">Isaiah 27</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
