<b>Volume 3, Lesson 11</b><br>
by C.I. Scofield
<h2>The Believer's Two Natures</h2></center>
<p>The Scriptures teach that every redeemed person is the possessor of two natures. One is received by natural birth, which is wholly and helplessly bad. The other is a new nature received through the new birth, which is the nature of God Himself, and therefore wholly good.</p>
<b><ol type="A">
<li>The natural man (born of the flesh)</b><ul>
<li><a href="psa51.htm#5">Psalm 51:5</a> - &quot;Shapen in iniquity&quot;
<li><a href="1cor2.htm#14">1Corinthians 2:14</a> - &quot;Receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God&quot;
<li><a href="mar7.htm#21">Mark 7:21-23</a> - &quot;All these evil things come from within&quot;
<li><a href="eph4.htm#22">Ephesians 4:22</a> - &quot;The old man, which is corrupt&quot;
<li><a href="rom8.htm#8">Romans 8:8</a> - &quot;They that are in the flesh cannot please God&quot;
<li><a href="joh6.htm#63">John 6:63</a> - &quot;The flesh profiteth nothing&quot;
<li><a href="rom8.htm#7">Romans 8:7</a> - &quot;The carnal mind is enmity against God&quot;
<li><a href="jer17.htm#9">Jeremiah 17:9</a> - &quot;Deceitful above all things, and desperately wicked&quot;<br>By these it appears that the unbeliever has a three-fold incapacity. He may be gifted, cultured, friendly, generous, religious -- or all these together, but he can neither please, obey, nor understand God. The believer, while still having his old nature, has received a new nature which, &quot;after God is created in righteousness and true holiness&quot; (<a href="eph4.htm#24">Ephesians 4:24</a>).</ul><b>
<li>The new man (born of the Spirit)</b><ul>
<li><a href="joh1.htm#11">John 1:11-13</a> - &quot;Born... of God&quot;
<li><a href="joh3.htm#3">John 3:3</a> - &quot;Except a man be born again&quot;
<li><a href="gal3.htm#26">Galatians 3:26</a> - &quot;Ye are all the children of God&quot;
<li><a href="eph4.htm#24">Ephesians 4:24</a> - &quot;Put on the new man... created in righteousness&quot;
<li><a href="2cor5.htm#17">2Corinthians 5:17</a> - &quot;He is a new creature&quot;
<li><a href="gal2.htm#20">Galatians 2:20</a> - &quot;Christ liveth in me&quot;
<li><a href="col3.htm#3">Colossians 3:3,4</a> - &quot;Ye are dead, and your life is hid with Christ&quot;
<li><a href="php1.htm#21">Philippians 1:21</a> - &quot;For to me to live is Christ&quot;
<li><a href="col1.htm#27">Colossians 1:27</a> - &quot;Christ in you&quot;
<li><a href="1joh5.htm#11">1John 5:11,12</a> - &quot;This life is in His Son&quot;</ul><b>
<li>Conflict between the two natures</b><ul>
<li><a href="rom7.htm#14">Romans 7:14-21</a> - &quot;What I hate, that I do&quot;<br>Study carefully the battle between the two &quot;I's&quot; -- the old Saul and the new Paul. It is an experience like this which so perplexes and discourages young converts, and leads them to doubt their acceptance with God.</ul><b>
<li>Our Helper (the Holy Spirit)</b><ul>
<li><a href="gal5.htm#16">Galatians 5:16-18</a> - &quot;Walk in the Spirit... led of the Spirit&quot;
<li><a href="rom8.htm#12">Romans 8:12,13</a> - &quot;Ye through the Spirit do mortify [subdue] the deeds of the body&quot;<br>The new man has a mighty helper in the indwelling Spirit, and the secret of victory over the natural man is to walk in the Spirit.</ul><b>
<li>Crucified with Christ</b><ul>
<li><a href="rom6.htm#6">Romans 6:6,7</a> - &quot;Our old man is crucified with Him&quot;
<li><a href="php3.htm#3">Philippians 3:3</a> - &quot;Have no confidence in the flesh&quot;
<li><a href="gal2.htm#20">Galatians 2:20</a> - &quot;I am crucified with Christ&quot;
<li><a href="rom13.htm#14">Romans 13:14</a> - &quot;Put ye on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make not provision for the flesh&quot;</ul><p>The Scriptures do not teach that it is God's purpose to improve, or make over, the old nature. The expression, &quot;a change of heart,&quot; is not found in the Word. The Scriptures do teach that our &quot;old man is crucified with [Christ]&quot; (<a href="rom6.htm#6">Romans 6:6</a>). In that sense, we &quot;are dead,&quot; and we are called upon to make this a constant experience by mortifying (treating as dead) our old man and his desires.</ol>
