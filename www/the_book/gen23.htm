Genesis  23<br>1. And Sarah was an hundred and seven and twenty years old: [these were] the years of the life of Sarah.<br><a name="2">2</a>  And Sarah died in Kirjatharba; the same [is] Hebron in the land of Canaan: and Abraham came to mourn for Sarah, and to weep for her.<br><a name="3">3</a>. And Abraham stood up from before his dead, and spake unto the sons of Heth, saying,<br><a name="4">4</a>  I [am] a stranger and a sojourner with you: give me a possession of a buryingplace with you, that I may bury my dead out of my sight.<br><a name="5">5</a>  And the children of Heth answered Abraham, saying unto him,<br><a name="6">6</a>  Hear us, my lord: thou [art] a mighty prince among us: in the choice of our sepulchres bury thy dead; none of us shall withhold from thee his sepulchre, but that thou mayest bury thy dead.<br><a name="7">7</a>  And Abraham stood up, and bowed himself to the people of the land, [even] to the children of Heth.<br><a name="8">8</a>  And he communed with them, saying, If it be your mind that I should bury my dead out of my sight; hear me, and intreat for me to Ephron the son of Zohar,<br><a name="9">9</a>  That he may give me the cave of Machpelah, which he hath, which [is] in the end of his field; for as much money as it is worth he shall give it me for a possession of a buryingplace amongst you.<br><a name="10">10</a>  And Ephron dwelt among the children of Heth: and Ephron the Hittite answered Abraham in the audience of the children of Heth, [even] of all that went in at the gate of his city, saying,<br><a name="11">11</a>  Nay, my lord, hear me: the field give I thee, and the cave that [is] therein, I give it thee; in the presence of the sons of my people give I it thee: bury thy dead.<br><a name="12">12</a>  And Abraham bowed down himself before the people of the land.<br><a name="13">13</a>  And he spake unto Ephron in the audience of the people of the land, saying, But if thou [wilt give it], I pray thee, hear me: I will give thee money for the field; take [it] of me, and I will bury my dead there.<br><a name="14">14</a>  And Ephron answered Abraham, saying unto him,<br><a name="15">15</a>  My lord, hearken unto me: the land [is worth] four hundred shekels of silver; what [is] that betwixt me and thee? bury therefore thy dead.<br><a name="16">16</a>. And Abraham hearkened unto Ephron; and Abraham weighed to Ephron the silver, which he had named in the audience of the sons of Heth, four hundred shekels of silver, current [money] with the merchant.<br><a name="17">17</a>  And the field of Ephron, which [was] in Machpelah, which [was] before Mamre, the field, and the cave which [was] therein, and all the trees that [were] in the field, that [were] in all the borders round about, were made sure<br><a name="18">18</a>  Unto Abraham for a possession in the presence of the children of Heth, before all that went in at the gate of his city.<br><a name="19">19</a>  And after this, Abraham buried Sarah his wife in the cave of the field of Machpelah before Mamre: the same [is] Hebron in the land of Canaan.<br><a name="20">20</a>  And the field, and the cave that [is] therein, were made sure unto Abraham for a possession of a buryingplace by the sons of Heth.<br><br>Go to <a href="gen24.htm#1">Genesis 24</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
