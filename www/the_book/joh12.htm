Then Jesus six days before the passover came to Bethany, where Lazarus was which had been dead, whom he raised from the dead.<br><a name="2">2</a>  There they made him a supper; and Martha served: but Lazarus was one of them that sat at the table with him.<br><a name="3">3</a>  Then took Mary a pound of ointment of spikenard, very costly, and anointed the feet of Jesus, and wiped his feet with her hair: and the house was filled with the odour of the ointment.<br><a name="4">4</a>  Then saith one of his disciples, Judas Iscariot, Simon's [son], which should betray him,<br><a name="5">5</a>  Why was not this ointment sold for three hundred pence, and given to the poor?<br><a name="6">6</a>  This he said, not that he cared for the poor; but because he was a thief, and had the bag, and bare what was put therein.<br><a name="7">7</a>  Then said Jesus, Let her alone: against the day of my burying hath she kept this.<br><a name="8">8</a>  For the poor always ye have with you; but me ye have not always.<br><a name="9">9</a>  Much people of the Jews therefore knew that he was there: and they came not for Jesus' sake only, but that they might see Lazarus also, whom he had raised from the dead.<br><a name="10">10</a>  But the chief priests consulted that they might put Lazarus also to death;<br><a name="11">11</a>  Because that by reason of him many of the Jews went away, and believed on Jesus.<br><a name="12">12</a>. On the next day much people that were come to the feast, when they heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem,<br><a name="13">13</a>  Took branches of palm trees, and went forth to meet him, and cried, Hosanna: Blessed [is] the King of Israel that cometh in the name of the Lord.<br><a name="14">14</a>  And Jesus, when he had found a young ass, sat thereon; as it is written,<br><a name="15">15</a>  Fear not, daughter of Sion: behold, thy King cometh, sitting on an ass's colt.<br><a name="16">16</a>  These things understood not his disciples at the first: but when Jesus was glorified, then remembered they that these things were written of him, and [that] they had done these things unto him.<br><a name="17">17</a>  The people therefore that was with him when he called Lazarus out of his grave, and raised him from the dead, bare record.<br><a name="18">18</a>  For this cause the people also met him, for that they heard that he had done this miracle.<br><a name="19">19</a>  The Pharisees therefore said among themselves, Perceive ye how ye prevail nothing? behold, the world is gone after him.<br><a name="20">20</a>. And there were certain Greeks among them that came up to worship at the feast:<br><a name="21">21</a>  The same came therefore to Philip, which was of Bethsaida of Galilee, and desired him, saying, Sir, we would see Jesus.<br><a name="22">22</a>  Philip cometh and telleth Andrew: and again Andrew and Philip tell Jesus.<br><a name="23">23</a>  And Jesus answered them, saying, The hour is come, that the Son of man should be glorified.<br><a name="24">24</a>  Verily, verily, I say unto you, Except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die, it abideth alone: but if it die, it bringeth forth much fruit.<br><a name="25">25</a>  He that loveth his life shall lose it; and he that hateth his life in this world shall keep it unto life eternal.<br><a name="26">26</a>  If any man serve me, let him follow me; and where I am, there shall also my servant be: if any man serve me, him will [my] Father honour.<br><a name="27">27</a>. Now is my soul troubled; and what shall I say? Father, save me from this hour: but for this cause came I unto this hour.<br><a name="28">28</a>  Father, glorify thy name. Then came there a voice from heaven, [saying], I have both glorified [it], and will glorify [it] again.<br><a name="29">29</a>  The people therefore, that stood by, and heard [it], said that it thundered: others said, An angel spake to him.<br><a name="30">30</a>  Jesus answered and said, This voice came not because of me, but for your sakes.<br><a name="31">31</a>  Now is the judgment of this world: now shall the prince of this world be cast out.<br><a name="32">32</a>  And I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all [men] unto me.<br><a name="33">33</a>  This he said, signifying what death he should die.<br><a name="34">34</a>  The people answered him, We have heard out of the law that Christ abideth for ever: and how sayest thou, The Son of man must be lifted up? who is this Son of man?<br><a name="35">35</a>  Then Jesus said unto them, Yet a little while is the light with you. Walk while ye have the light, lest darkness come upon you: for he that walketh in darkness knoweth not whither he goeth.<br><a name="36">36</a>  While ye have light, believe in the light, that ye may be the children of light. These things spake Jesus, and departed, and did hide himself from them.<br><a name="37">37</a>. But though he had done so many miracles before them, yet they believed not on him:<br><a name="38">38</a>  That the saying of Esaias the prophet might be fulfilled, which he spake, Lord, who hath believed our report? and to whom hath the arm of the Lord been revealed?<br><a name="39">39</a>  Therefore they could not believe, because that Esaias said again,<br><a name="40">40</a>  He hath blinded their eyes, and hardened their heart; that they should not see with [their] eyes, nor understand with [their] heart, and be converted, and I should heal them.<br><a name="41">41</a>  These things said Esaias, when he saw his glory, and spake of him.<br><a name="42">42</a>. Nevertheless among the chief rulers also many believed on him; but because of the Pharisees they did not confess [him], lest they should be put out of the synagogue:<br><a name="43">43</a>  For they loved the praise of men more than the praise of God.<br><a name="44">44</a>. Jesus cried and said, He that believeth on me, believeth not on me, but on him that sent me.<br><a name="45">45</a>  And he that seeth me seeth him that sent me.<br><a name="46">46</a>  I am come a light into the world, that whosoever believeth on me should not abide in darkness.<br><a name="47">47</a>  And if any man hear my words, and believe not, I judge him not: for I came not to judge the world, but to save the world.<br><a name="48">48</a>  He that rejecteth me, and receiveth not my words, hath one that judgeth him: the word that I have spoken, the same shall judge him in the last day.<br><a name="49">49</a>  For I have not spoken of myself; but the Father which sent me, he gave me a commandment, what I should say, and what I should speak.<br><a name="50">50</a>  And I know that his commandment is life everlasting: whatsoever I speak therefore, even as the Father said unto me, so I speak.<br><br>Go to <a href="joh13.htm#1">John 13</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
