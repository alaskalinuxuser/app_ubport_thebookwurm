Proverbs  13<br>1. A wise son [heareth] his father's instruction: but a scorner heareth not rebuke.<br><a name="2">2</a>. A man shall eat good by the fruit of [his] mouth: but the soul of the transgressors [shall eat] violence.<br><a name="3">3</a>. He that keepeth his mouth keepeth his life: [but] he that openeth wide his lips shall have destruction.<br><a name="4">4</a>. The soul of the sluggard desireth, and [hath] nothing: but the soul of the diligent shall be made fat.<br><a name="5">5</a>. A righteous [man] hateth lying: but a wicked [man] is loathsome, and cometh to shame.<br><a name="6">6</a>. Righteousness keepeth [him that is] upright in the way: but wickedness overthroweth the sinner.<br><a name="7">7</a>. There is that maketh himself rich, yet [hath] nothing: [there is] that maketh himself poor, yet [hath] great riches.<br><a name="8">8</a>.

Wealth [gotten] by vanity shall be diminished: but he that gathereth by labour shall increase.<br><a name="12">12</a>. Hope deferred maketh the heart sick: but [when] the desire cometh, [it is] a tree of life.<br><a name="13">13</a>. Whoso despiseth the word shall be destroyed: but he that feareth the commandment shall be rewarded.<br><a name="14">14</a>. The law of the wise [is] a fountain of life, to depart from the snares of death.<br><a name="15">15</a>. Good understanding giveth favour: but the way of transgressors [is] hard.<br><a name="16">16</a>. Every prudent [man] dealeth with knowledge: but a fool layeth open [his] folly.<br><a name="17">17</a>. A wicked messenger falleth into mischief: but a faithful ambassador [is] health.<br><a name="18">18</a>.
