Leviticus   1<br>1. And the LORD called unto Moses, and spake unto him out of the tabernacle of the congregation, saying,<br><a name="2">2</a>  Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, If any man of you bring an offering unto the LORD, ye shall bring your offering of the cattle, [even] of the herd, and of the flock.<br><a name="3">3</a>. If his offering [be] a burnt sacrifice of the herd, let him offer a male without blemish: he shall offer it of his own voluntary will at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation before the LORD.<br><a name="4">4</a>  And he shall put his hand upon the head of the burnt offering; and it shall be accepted for him to make atonement for him.<br><a name="5">5</a>  And he shall kill the bullock before the LORD: and the priests, Aaron's sons, shall bring the blood, and sprinkle the blood round about upon the altar that [is by] the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.<br><a name="6">6</a>  And he shall flay the burnt offering, and cut it into his pieces.<br><a name="7">7</a>  And the sons of Aaron the priest shall put fire upon the altar, and lay the wood in order upon the fire:<br><a name="8">8</a>  And the priests, Aaron's sons, shall lay the parts, the head, and the fat, in order upon the wood that [is] on the fire which [is] upon the altar:<br><a name="9">9</a>  But his inwards and his legs shall he wash in water: and the priest shall burn all on the altar, [to be] a burnt sacrifice, an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the LORD.<br><a name="10">10</a>. And if his offering [be] of the flocks, [namely], of the sheep, or of the goats, for a burnt sacrifice; he shall bring it a male without blemish.<br><a name="11">11</a>  And he shall kill it on the side of the altar northward before the LORD: and the priests, Aaron's sons, shall sprinkle his blood round about upon the altar.<br><a name="12">12</a>  And he shall cut it into his pieces, with his head and his fat: and the priest shall lay them in order on the wood that [is] on the fire which [is] upon the altar:<br><a name="13">13</a>  But he shall wash the inwards and the legs with water: and the priest shall bring [it] all, and burn [it] upon the altar: it [is] a burnt sacrifice, an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the LORD.<br><a name="14">14</a>  And if the burnt sacrifice for his offering to the LORD [be] of fowls, then he shall bring his offering of turtledoves, or of young pigeons.<br><a name="15">15</a>  And the priest shall bring it unto the altar, and wring off his head, and burn [it] on the altar; and the blood thereof shall be wrung out at the side of the altar:<br><a name="16">16</a>  And he shall pluck away his crop with his feathers, and cast it beside the altar on the east part, by the place of the ashes:<br><a name="17">17</a>  And he shall cleave it with the wings thereof, [but] shall not divide [it] asunder: and the priest shall burn it upon the altar, upon the wood that [is] upon the fire: it [is] a burnt sacrifice, an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the LORD.<br><br>Go to <a href="lev2.htm#1">Leviticus 2</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
