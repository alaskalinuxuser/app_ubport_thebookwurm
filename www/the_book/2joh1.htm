2John   1<br>1. The elder unto the elect lady and her children, whom I love in the truth; and not I only, but also all they that have known the truth;<br><a name="2">2</a>  For the truth's sake, which dwelleth in us, and shall be with us for ever.<br><a name="3">3</a>  Grace be with you, mercy, [and] peace, from God the Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of the Father, in truth and love.<br><a name="4">4</a>  I rejoiced greatly that I found of thy children walking in truth, as we have received a commandment from the Father.<br><a name="5">5</a>. And now I beseech thee, lady, not as though I wrote a new commandment unto thee, but that which we had from the beginning, that we love one another.<br><a name="6">6</a>  And this is love, that we walk after his commandments. This is the commandment, That, as ye have heard from the beginning, ye should walk in it.<br><a name="7">7</a>. For many deceivers are entered into the world, who confess not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh. This is a deceiver and an antichrist.<br><a name="8">8</a>  Look to yourselves, that we lose not those things which we have wrought, but that we receive a full reward.<br><a name="9">9</a>  Whosoever transgresseth, and abideth not in the doctrine of Christ, hath not God. He that abideth in the doctrine of Christ, he hath both the Father and the Son.<br><a name="10">10</a>. If there come any unto you, and bring not this doctrine, receive him not into [your] house, neither bid him God speed:<br><a name="11">11</a>  For he that biddeth him God speed is partaker of his evil deeds.<br><a name="12">12</a>. Having many things to write unto you, I would not [write] with paper and ink: but I trust to come unto you, and speak face to face, that our joy may be full.<br><a name="13">13</a>  The children of thy elect sister greet thee. Amen.<br><br>End of II John.<br>Go to <a href="3joh1.htm#1">III John 1</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
