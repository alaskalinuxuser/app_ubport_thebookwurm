James, a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ, to the twelve tribes which are scattered abroad, greeting.<br><a name="2">2</a>. My brethren, count it all joy when ye fall into divers temptations;<br><a name="3">3</a>  Knowing [this], that the trying of your faith worketh patience.<br><a name="4">4</a>  But let patience have [her] perfect work, that ye may be perfect and entire, wanting nothing.<br><a name="5">5</a>  If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all [men] liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him.<br><a name="6">6</a>  But let him ask in faith, nothing wavering. For he that wavereth is like a wave of the sea driven with the wind and tossed.<br><a name="7">7</a>  For let not that man think that he shall receive any thing of the Lord.<br><a name="8">8</a>  A double minded man [is] unstable in all his ways.<br><a name="9">9</a>  Let the brother of low degree rejoice in that he is exalted:<br><a name="10">10</a>  But the rich, in that he is made low: because as the flower of the grass he shall pass away.<br><a name="11">11</a>  For the sun is no sooner risen with a burning heat, but it withereth the grass, and the flower thereof falleth, and the grace of the fashion of it perisheth: so also shall the rich man fade away in his ways.<br><a name="12">12</a>  Blessed [is] the man that endureth temptation: for when he is tried, he shall receive the crown of life, which the Lord hath promised to them that love him.<br><a name="13"></a> 13. Let no man say when he is tempted, I am tempted of God: for God cannot be tempted with evil, neither tempteth he any man:<br><a name="14">14</a>  But every man is tempted, when he is drawn away of his own lust, and enticed.<br><a name="15">15</a>  Then when lust hath conceived, it bringeth forth sin: and sin, when it is finished, bringeth forth death.<br><a name="16">16</a>  Do not err, my beloved brethren.<br><a name="17"></a> 17  Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, and cometh down from the Father of lights, with whom is no variableness, neither shadow of turning.<br><a name="18">18</a>  Of his own will begat he us with the word of truth, that we should be a kind of firstfruits of his creatures.<br><a name="19">19</a>. Wherefore, my beloved brethren, let every man be swift to hear, slow to speak, slow to wrath:<br><a name="20">20</a>  For the wrath of man worketh not the righteousness of God.<br><a name="21">21</a>  Wherefore lay apart all filthiness and superfluity of naughtiness, and receive with meekness the engrafted word, which is able to save your souls.<br><a name="22">22</a>  But be ye doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving your own selves.<br><a name="23">23</a>  For if any be a hearer of the word, and not a doer, he is like unto a man beholding his natural face in a glass:<br><a name="24">24</a>  For he beholdeth himself, and goeth his way, and straightway forgetteth what manner of man he was.<br><a name="25">25</a>  But whoso looketh into the perfect law of liberty, and continueth [therein], he being not a forgetful hearer, but a doer of the work, this man shall be blessed in his deed.<br><a name="26">26</a>  If any man among you seem to be religious, and bridleth not his tongue, but deceiveth his own heart, this man's religion [is] vain.<br><a name="27">27</a>  Pure religion and undefiled before God and the Father is this, To visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction, [and] to keep himself unspotted from the world.<br><br>Go to <a href="jam2.htm#1">James 2</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
