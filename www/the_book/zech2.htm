Zechariah   2<br> 1. I lifted up mine eyes again, and looked, and behold a man with a measuring line in his hand.<br><a name="2">2</a>  Then said I, Whither goest thou? And he said unto me, To measure Jerusalem, to see what [is] the breadth thereof, and what [is] the length thereof.<br><a name="3">3</a>  And, behold, the angel that talked with me went forth, and another angel went out to meet him,<br><a name="4">4</a>  And said unto him, Run, speak to this young man, saying, Jerusalem shall be inhabited [as] towns without walls for the multitude of men and cattle therein:<br><a name="5">5</a>  For I, saith the LORD, will be unto her a wall of fire round about, and will be the glory in the midst of her.<br><a name="6">6</a>. Ho, ho, [come forth], and flee from the land of the north, saith the LORD: for I have spread you abroad as the four winds of the heaven, saith the LORD.<br><a name="7">7</a>  Deliver thyself, O Zion, that dwellest [with] the daughter of Babylon.<br><a name="8">8</a>  For thus saith the LORD of hosts; After the glory hath he sent me unto the nations which spoiled you: for he that toucheth you toucheth the apple of his eye.<br><a name="9">9</a>  For, behold, I will shake mine hand upon them, and they shall be a spoil to their servants: and ye shall know that the LORD of hosts hath sent me.<br><a name="10">10</a>. Sing and rejoice, O daughter of Zion: for, lo, I come, and I will dwell in the midst of thee, saith the LORD.<br><a name="11">11</a>  And many nations shall be joined to the LORD in that day, and shall be my people: and I will dwell in the midst of thee, and thou shalt know that the LORD of hosts hath sent me unto thee.<br><a name="12">12</a>  And the LORD shall inherit Judah his portion in the holy land, and shall choose Jerusalem again.<br><a name="13">13</a>  Be silent, O all flesh, before the LORD: for he is raised up out of his holy habitation.<br><br>Go to <a href="zech3.htm#1">Zechariah 3</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
