1Chronicles  16<br>1. So they brought the ark of God, and set it in the midst of the tent that David had pitched for it: and they offered burnt sacrifices and peace offerings before God.<br><a name="2">2</a>  And when David had made an end of offering the burnt offerings and the peace offerings, he blessed the people in the name of the LORD.<br><a name="3">3</a>  And he dealt to every one of Israel, both man and woman, to every one a loaf of bread, and a good piece of flesh, and a flagon [of wine].<br><a name="4">4</a>  And he appointed [certain] of the Levites to minister before the ark of the LORD, and to record, and to thank and praise the LORD God of Israel:<br><a name="5">5</a>  Asaph the chief, and next to him Zechariah, Jeiel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehiel, and Mattithiah, and Eliab, and Benaiah, and Obededom: and Jeiel with psalteries and with harps; but Asaph made a sound with cymbals;<br><a name="6">6</a>  Benaiah also and Jahaziel the priests with trumpets continually before the ark of the covenant of God.<br><a name="7">7</a>. Then on that day David delivered first [this psalm] to thank the LORD into the hand of Asaph and his brethren.<br><a name="8">8</a>  Give thanks unto the LORD, call upon his name, make known his deeds among the people.<br><a name="9">9</a>  Sing unto him, sing psalms unto him, talk ye of all his wondrous works.<br><a name="10">10</a>  Glory ye in his holy name: let the heart of them rejoice that seek the LORD.<br><a name="11">11</a>  Seek the LORD and his strength, seek his face continually.<br><a name="12">12</a>  Remember his marvellous works that he hath done, his wonders, and the judgments of his mouth;<br><a name="13">13</a>  O ye seed of Israel his servant, ye children of Jacob, his chosen ones.<br><a name="14">14</a>  He [is] the LORD our God; his judgments [are] in all the earth.<br><a name="15">15</a>  Be ye mindful always of his covenant; the word [which] he commanded to a thousand generations;<br><a name="16">16</a>  [Even of the covenant] which he made with Abraham, and of his oath unto Isaac;<br><a name="17">17</a>  And hath confirmed the same to Jacob for a law, [and] to Israel [for] an everlasting covenant,<br><a name="18">18</a>  Saying, Unto thee will I give the land of Canaan, the lot of your inheritance;<br><a name="19">19</a>  When ye were but few, even a few, and strangers in it.<br><a name="20">20</a>  And [when] they went from nation to nation, and from [one] kingdom to another people;<br><a name="21">21</a>  He suffered no man to do them wrong: yea, he reproved kings for their sakes,<br><a name="22">22</a>  [Saying], Touch not mine anointed, and do my prophets no harm.<br><a name="23">23</a>  Sing unto the LORD, all the earth; shew forth from day to day his salvation.<br><a name="24">24</a>  Declare his glory among the heathen; his marvellous works among all nations.<br><a name="25">25</a>  For great [is] the LORD, and greatly to be praised: he also [is] to be feared above all gods.<br><a name="26">26</a>  For all the gods of the people [are] idols: but the LORD made the heavens.<br><a name="27">27</a>  Glory and honour [are] in his presence; strength and gladness [are] in his place.<br><a name="28">28</a>  Give unto the LORD, ye kindreds of the people, give unto the LORD glory and strength.<br><a name="29">29</a>  Give unto the LORD the glory [due] unto his name: bring an offering, and come before him: worship the LORD in the beauty of holiness.<br><a name="30">30</a>  Fear before him, all the earth: the world also shall be stable, that it be not moved.<br><a name="31">31</a>  Let the heavens be glad, and let the earth rejoice: and let [men] say among the nations, The LORD reigneth.<br><a name="32">32</a>  Let the sea roar, and the fulness thereof: let the fields rejoice, and all that [is] therein.<br><a name="33">33</a>  Then shall the trees of the wood sing out at the presence of the LORD, because he cometh to judge the earth.<br><a name="34">34</a>  O give thanks unto the LORD; for [he is] good; for his mercy [endureth] for ever.<br><a name="35">35</a>  And say ye, Save us, O God of our salvation, and gather us together, and deliver us from the heathen, that we may give thanks to thy holy name, [and] glory in thy praise.<br><a name="36">36</a>  Blessed [be] the LORD God of Israel for ever and ever. And all the people said, Amen, and praised the LORD.<br><a name="37">37</a>. So he left there before the ark of the covenant of the LORD Asaph and his brethren, to minister before the ark continually, as every day's work required:<br><a name="38">38</a>  And Obededom with their brethren, threescore and eight; Obededom also the son of Jeduthun and Hosah [to be] porters:<br><a name="39">39</a>  And Zadok the priest, and his brethren the priests, before the tabernacle of the LORD in the high place that [was] at Gibeon,<br><a name="40">40</a>  To offer burnt offerings unto the LORD upon the altar of the burnt offering continually morning and evening, and [to do] according to all that is written in the law of the LORD, which he commanded Israel;<br><a name="41">41</a>  And with them Heman and Jeduthun, and the rest that were chosen, who were expressed by name, to give thanks to the LORD, because his mercy [endureth] for ever;<br><a name="42">42</a>  And with them Heman and Jeduthun with trumpets and cymbals for those that should make a sound, and with musical instruments of God. And the sons of Jeduthun [were] porters.<br><a name="43">43</a>  And all the people departed every man to his house: and David returned to bless his house.<br><br>Go to <a href="1chr17.htm#1">I Chronicles 17</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
