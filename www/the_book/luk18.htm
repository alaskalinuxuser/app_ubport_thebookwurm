Luke  18<br> 1. And he spake a parable unto them [to this end], that men ought always to pray, and not to faint;<br><a name="2">2</a>  Saying, There was in a city a judge, which feared not God, neither regarded man:<br><a name="3">3</a>  And there was a widow in that city; and she came unto him, saying, Avenge me of mine adversary.<br><a name="4">4</a>  And he would not for a while: but afterward he said within himself, Though I fear not God, nor regard man;<br><a name="5">5</a>  Yet because this widow troubleth me, I will avenge her, lest by her continual coming she weary me.<br><a name="6">6</a>  And the Lord said, Hear what the unjust judge saith.<br><a name="7">7</a>  And shall not God avenge his own elect, which cry day and night unto him, though he bear long with them?<br><a name="8">8</a>  I tell you that he will avenge them speedily. Nevertheless when the Son of man cometh, shall he find faith on the earth?<br><a name="9">9</a>. And he spake this parable unto certain which trusted in themselves that they were righteous, and despised others:<br><a name="10">10</a>  Two men went up into the temple to pray; the one a Pharisee, and the other a publican.<br><a name="11">11</a>  The Pharisee stood and prayed thus with himself, God, I thank thee, that I am not as other men [are], extortioners, unjust, adulterers, or even as this publican.<br><a name="12">12</a>  I fast twice in the week, I give tithes of all that I possess.<br><a name="13">13</a>  And the publican, standing afar off, would not lift up so much as [his] eyes unto heaven, but smote upon his breast, saying, God be merciful to me a sinner.<br><a name="14">14</a>  I tell you, this man went down to his house justified [rather] than the other: for every one that exalteth himself shall be abased; and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted.<br><a name="15">15</a>. And they brought unto him also infants, that he would touch them: but when [his] disciples saw [it], they rebuked them.<br><a name="16">16</a>  But Jesus called them [unto him], and said, Suffer little children to come unto me, and forbid them not: for of such is the kingdom of God.<br><a name="17">17</a>  Verily I say unto you, Whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of God as a little child shall in no wise enter therein.<br><a name="18">18</a>. And a certain ruler asked him, saying, Good Master, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?<br><a name="19">19</a>  And Jesus said unto him, Why callest thou me good? none [is] good, save one, [that is], God.<br><a name="20">20</a>  Thou knowest the commandments, Do not commit adultery, Do not kill, Do not steal, Do not bear false witness, Honour thy father and thy mother.<br><a name="21">21</a>  And he said, All these have I kept from my youth up.<br><a name="22">22</a>  Now when Jesus heard these things, he said unto him, Yet lackest thou one thing: sell all that thou hast, and distribute unto the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven: and come, follow me.<br><a name="23">23</a>  And when he heard this, he was very sorrowful: for he was very rich.<br><a name="24">24</a>  And when Jesus saw that he was very sorrowful, he said, How hardly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of God!<br><a name="25">25</a>  For it is easier for a camel to go through a needle's eye, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.<br><a name="26">26</a>  And they that heard [it] said, Who then can be saved?<br><a name="27">27</a>  And he said, The things which are impossible with men are possible with God.<br><a name="28">28</a>  Then Peter said, Lo, we have left all, and followed thee.<br><a name="29">29</a>  And he said unto them, Verily I say unto you, There is no man that hath left house, or parents, or brethren, or wife, or children, for the kingdom of God's sake,<br><a name="30">30</a>  Who shall not receive manifold more in this present time, and in the world to come life everlasting.<br><a name="31">31</a>. Then he took [unto him] the twelve, and said unto them, Behold, we go up to Jerusalem, and all things that are written by the prophets concerning the Son of man shall be accomplished.<br><a name="32">32</a>  For he shall be delivered unto the Gentiles, and shall be mocked, and spitefully entreated, and spitted on:<br><a name="33">33</a>  And they shall scourge [him], and put him to death: and the third day he shall rise again.<br><a name="34">34</a>  And they understood none of these things: and this saying was hid from them, neither knew they the things which were spoken.<br><a name="35">35</a>. And it came to pass, that as he was come nigh unto Jericho, a certain blind man sat by the way side begging:<br><a name="36">36</a>  And hearing the multitude pass by, he asked what it meant.<br><a name="37">37</a>  And they told him, that Jesus of Nazareth passeth by.<br><a name="38">38</a>  And he cried, saying, Jesus, [thou] Son of David, have mercy on me.<br><a name="39">39</a>  And they which went before rebuked him, that he should hold his peace: but he cried so much the more, [Thou] Son of David, have mercy on me.<br><a name="40">40</a>  And Jesus stood, and commanded him to be brought unto him: and when he was come near, he asked him,<br><a name="41">41</a>  Saying, What wilt thou that I shall do unto thee? And he said, Lord, that I may receive my sight.<br><a name="42">42</a>  And Jesus said unto him, Receive thy sight: thy faith hath saved thee.<br><a name="43">43</a>  And immediately he received his sight, and followed him, glorifying God: and all the people, when they saw [it], gave praise unto God.<br><br>Go to <a href="luk19.htm#1">Luke 19</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
