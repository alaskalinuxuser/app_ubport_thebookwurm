Isaiah  10<br>1. Woe unto them that decree unrighteous decrees, and that write grievousness [which] they have prescribed;<br><a name="2">2</a>  To turn aside the needy from judgment, and to take away the right from the poor of my people, that widows may be their prey, and [that] they may rob the fatherless!<br><a name="3">3</a>  And what will ye do in the day of visitation, and in the desolation [which] shall come from far? to whom will ye flee for help? and where will ye leave your glory?<br><a name="4">4</a>  Without me they shall bow down under the prisoners, and they shall fall under the slain. For all this his anger is not turned away, but his hand [is] stretched out still.<br><a name="5">5</a>. O Assyrian, the rod of mine anger, and the staff in their hand is mine indignation.<br><a name="6">6</a>  I will send him against an hypocritical nation, and against the people of my wrath will I give him a charge, to take the spoil, and to take the prey, and to tread them down like the mire of the streets.<br><a name="7">7</a>  Howbeit he meaneth not so, neither doth his heart think so; but [it is] in his heart to destroy and cut off nations not a few.<br><a name="8">8</a>  For he saith, [Are] not my princes altogether kings?<br><a name="9">9</a>  [Is] not Calno as Carchemish? [is] not Hamath as Arpad? [is] not Samaria as Damascus?<br><a name="10">10</a>  As my hand hath found the kingdoms of the idols, and whose graven images did excel them of Jerusalem and of Samaria;<br><a name="11">11</a>  Shall I not, as I have done unto Samaria and her idols, so do to Jerusalem and her idols?<br><a name="12">12</a>  Wherefore it shall come to pass, [that] when the Lord hath performed his whole work upon mount Zion and on Jerusalem, I will punish the fruit of the stout heart of the king of Assyria, and the glory of his high looks.<br><a name="13">13</a>  For he saith, By the strength of my hand I have done [it], and by my wisdom; for I am prudent: and I have removed the bounds of the people, and have robbed their treasures, and I have put down the inhabitants like a valiant [man]:<br><a name="14">14</a>  And my hand hath found as a nest the riches of the people: and as one gathereth eggs [that are] left, have I gathered all the earth; and there was none that moved the wing, or opened the mouth, or peeped.<br><a name="15">15</a>  Shall the axe boast itself against him that heweth therewith? [or] shall the saw magnify itself against him that shaketh it? as if the rod should shake [itself] against them that lift it up, [or] as if the staff should lift up [itself, as if it were] no wood.<br><a name="16">16</a>  Therefore shall the Lord, the Lord of hosts, send among his fat ones leanness; and under his glory he shall kindle a burning like the burning of a fire.<br><a name="17">17</a>  And the light of Israel shall be for a fire, and his Holy One for a flame: and it shall burn and devour his thorns and his briers in one day;<br><a name="18">18</a>  And shall consume the glory of his forest, and of his fruitful field, both soul and body: and they shall be as when a standardbearer fainteth.<br><a name="19">19</a>  And the rest of the trees of his forest shall be few, that a child may write them.<br><a name="20">20</a>. And it shall come to pass in that day, [that] the remnant of Israel, and such as are escaped of the house of Jacob, shall no more again stay upon him that smote them; but shall stay upon the LORD, the Holy One of Israel, in truth.<br><a name="21">21</a>  The remnant shall return, [even] the remnant of Jacob, unto the mighty God.<br><a name="22">22</a>  For though thy people Israel be as the sand of the sea, [yet] a remnant of them shall return: the consumption decreed shall overflow with righteousness.<br><a name="23">23</a>  For the Lord GOD of hosts shall make a consumption, even determined, in the midst of all the land.<br><a name="24">24</a>. Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD of hosts, O my people that dwellest in Zion, be not afraid of the Assyrian: he shall smite thee with a rod, and shall lift up his staff against thee, after the manner of Egypt.<br><a name="25">25</a>  For yet a very little while, and the indignation shall cease, and mine anger in their destruction.<br><a name="26">26</a>  And the LORD of hosts shall stir up a scourge for him according to the slaughter of Midian at the rock of Oreb: and [as] his rod [was] upon the sea, so shall he lift it up after the manner of Egypt.<br><a name="27">27</a>  And it shall come to pass in that day, [that] his burden shall be taken away from off thy shoulder, and his yoke from off thy neck, and the yoke shall be destroyed because of the anointing.<br><a name="28">28</a>  He is come to Aiath, he is passed to Migron; at Michmash he hath laid up his carriages:<br><a name="29">29</a>  They are gone over the passage: they have taken up their lodging at Geba; Ramah is afraid; Gibeah of Saul is fled.<br><a name="30">30</a>  Lift up thy voice, O daughter of Gallim: cause it to be heard unto Laish, O poor Anathoth.<br><a name="31">31</a>  Madmenah is removed; the inhabitants of Gebim gather themselves to flee.<br><a name="32">32</a>  As yet shall he remain at Nob that day: he shall shake his hand [against] the mount of the daughter of Zion, the hill of Jerusalem.<br><a name="33">33</a>  Behold, the Lord, the LORD of hosts, shall lop the bough with terror: and the high ones of stature [shall be] hewn down, and the haughty shall be humbled.<br><a name="34">34</a>  And he shall cut down the thickets of the forest with iron, and Lebanon shall fall by a mighty one.<br><br>Go to <a href="isa11.htm#1">Isaiah 11</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
