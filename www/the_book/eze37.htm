Ezekiel  37<br> 1. The hand of the LORD was upon me, and carried me out in the spirit of the LORD, and set me down in the midst of the valley which [was] full of bones,<br><a name="2">2</a>  And caused me to pass by them round about: and, behold, [there were] very many in the open valley; and, lo, [they were] very dry.<br><a name="3">3</a>  And he said unto me, Son of man, can these bones live? And I answered, O Lord GOD, thou knowest.<br><a name="4">4</a>  Again he said unto me, Prophesy upon these bones, and say unto them, O ye dry bones, hear the word of the LORD.<br><a name="5">5</a>  Thus saith the Lord GOD unto these bones; Behold, I will cause breath to enter into you, and ye shall live:<br><a name="6">6</a>  And I will lay sinews upon you, and will bring up flesh upon you, and cover you with skin, and put breath in you, and ye shall live; and ye shall know that I [am] the LORD.<br><a name="7">7</a>  So I prophesied as I was commanded: and as I prophesied, there was a noise, and behold a shaking, and the bones came together, bone to his bone.<br><a name="8">8</a>  And when I beheld, lo, the sinews and the flesh came up upon them, and the skin covered them above: but [there was] no breath in them.<br><a name="9">9</a>  Then said he unto me, Prophesy unto the wind, prophesy, son of man, and say to the wind, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Come from the four winds, O breath, and breathe upon these slain, that they may live.<br><a name="10">10</a>  So I prophesied as he commanded me, and the breath came into them, and they lived, and stood up upon their feet, an exceeding great army.<br><a name="11">11</a>  Then he said unto me, Son of man, these bones are the whole house of Israel: behold, they say, Our bones are dried, and our hope is lost: we are cut off for our parts.<br><a name="12">12</a>  Therefore prophesy and say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, O my people, I will open your graves, and cause you to come up out of your graves, and bring you into the land of Israel.<br><a name="13">13</a>  And ye shall know that I [am] the LORD, when I have opened your graves, O my people, and brought you up out of your graves,<br><a name="14">14</a>  And shall put my spirit in you, and ye shall live, and I shall place you in your own land: then shall ye know that I the LORD have spoken [it], and performed [it], saith the LORD.<br><a name="15">15</a>. The word of the LORD came again unto me, saying,<br><a name="16">16</a>  Moreover, thou son of man, take thee one stick, and write upon it, For Judah, and for the children of Israel his companions: then take another stick, and write upon it, For Joseph, the stick of Ephraim, and [for] all the house of Israel his companions:<br><a name="17">17</a>  And join them one to another into one stick; and they shall become one in thine hand.<br><a name="18">18</a>  And when the children of thy people shall speak unto thee, saying, Wilt thou not shew us what thou [meanest] by these?<br><a name="19">19</a>  Say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I will take the stick of Joseph, which [is] in the hand of Ephraim, and the tribes of Israel his fellows, and will put them with him, [even] with the stick of Judah, and make them one stick, and they shall be one in mine hand.<br><a name="20">20</a>  And the sticks whereon thou writest shall be in thine hand before their eyes.<br><a name="21">21</a>  And say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I will take the children of Israel from among the heathen, whither they be gone, and will gather them on every side, and bring them into their own land:<br><a name="22">22</a>  And I will make them one nation in the land upon the mountains of Israel; and one king shall be king to them all: and they shall be no more two nations, neither shall they be divided into two kingdoms any more at all:<br><a name="23">23</a>  Neither shall they defile themselves any more with their idols, nor with their detestable things, nor with any of their transgressions: but I will save them out of all their dwellingplaces, wherein they have sinned, and will cleanse them: so shall they be my people, and I will be their God.<br><a name="24">24</a>  And David my servant [shall be] king over them; and they all shall have one shepherd: they shall also walk in my judgments, and observe my statutes, and do them.<br><a name="25">25</a>  And they shall dwell in the land that I have given unto Jacob my servant, wherein your fathers have dwelt; and they shall dwell therein, [even] they, and their children, and their children's children for ever: and my servant David [shall be] their prince for ever.<br><a name="26">26</a>  Moreover I will make a covenant of peace with them; it shall be an everlasting covenant with them: and I will place them, and multiply them, and will set my sanctuary in the midst of them for evermore.<br><a name="27">27</a>  My tabernacle also shall be with them: yea, I will be their God, and they shall be my people.<br><a name="28">28</a>  And the heathen shall know that I the LORD do sanctify Israel, when my sanctuary shall be in the midst of them for evermore.<br><br>Go to <a href="eze38.htm#1">Ezekiel 38</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
