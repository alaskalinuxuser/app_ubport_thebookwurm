Job  12<br>1. And Job answered and said,<br><a name="2">2</a>  No doubt but ye [are] the people, and wisdom shall die with you.<br><a name="3">3</a>  But I have understanding as well as you; I [am] not inferior to you: yea, who knoweth not such things as these?<br><a name="4">4</a>  I am [as] one mocked of his neighbour, who calleth upon God, and he answereth him: the just upright [man is] laughed to scorn.<br><a name="5">5</a>  He that is ready to slip with [his] feet [is as] a lamp despised in the thought of him that is at ease.<br><a name="6">6</a>. The tabernacles of robbers prosper, and they that provoke God are secure; into whose hand God bringeth [abundantly].<br><a name="7">7</a>  But ask now the beasts, and they shall teach thee; and the fowls of the air, and they shall tell thee:<br><a name="8">8</a>  Or speak to the earth, and it shall teach thee: and the fishes of the sea shall declare unto thee.<br><a name="9">9</a>  Who knoweth not in all these that the hand of the LORD hath wrought this?<br><a name="10">10</a>  In whose hand [is] the soul of every living thing, and the breath of all mankind.<br><a name="11">11</a>  Doth not the ear try words? and the mouth taste his meat?<br><a name="12">12</a>. With the ancient [is] wisdom; and in length of days understanding.<br><a name="13">13</a>  With him [is] wisdom and strength, he hath counsel and understanding.<br><a name="14">14</a>  Behold, he breaketh down, and it cannot be built again: he shutteth up a man, and there can be no opening.<br><a name="15">15</a>  Behold, he withholdeth the waters, and they dry up: also he sendeth them out, and they overturn the earth.<br><a name="16">16</a>  With him [is] strength and wisdom: the deceived and the deceiver [are] his.<br><a name="17">17</a>  He leadeth counsellors away spoiled, and maketh the judges fools.<br><a name="18">18</a>  He looseth the bond of kings, and girdeth their loins with a girdle.<br><a name="19">19</a>  He leadeth princes away spoiled, and overthroweth the mighty.<br><a name="20">20</a>  He removeth away the speech of the trusty, and taketh away the understanding of the aged.<br><a name="21">21</a>  He poureth contempt upon princes, and weakeneth the strength of the mighty.<br><a name="22">22</a>  He discovereth deep things out of darkness, and bringeth out to light the shadow of death.<br><a name="23">23</a>  He increaseth the nations, and destroyeth them: he enlargeth the nations, and straiteneth them [again].<br><a name="24">24</a>  He taketh away the heart of the chief of the people of the earth, and causeth them to wander in a wilderness [where there is] no way.<br><a name="25">25</a>  They grope in the dark without light, and he maketh them to stagger like [a] drunken [man].<br><br>Go to <a href="job13.htm#1">Job 13</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
