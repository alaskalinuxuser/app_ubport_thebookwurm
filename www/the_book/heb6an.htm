<dd>{*}Note: These are OT foundational principles and should not be confused with similar practices with distinctly Christian meanings (eg., observe the differing ''baptisms'' of <a href="act19.htm#3">Acts 19:3-6</a>).<br>&nbsp;
<dt>
<b><i>6:3 And this will we do, if God permit.</i></b></dt><dl>
<dt>ie., By God's grace, we will move on --<ul>
<li>from the elemental things which should lead us to Christ
<dd>(eg., the OT Law and John's Teaching &amp; Baptism, as in <a href="heb6.htm#1" target="lwr_lt">vs.1-2</a> above)</dd>
<dd>cp. <a href="gal3.htm#24">Gal 3:24</a>; <a href="act18.htm#24">Acts 18:24-26</a></dd>
<li>to truly know Christ and to become mature in Him.</ul>
<dt>But not everyone, who starts to follow Christ, will continue to this end. <a href="joh6.htm#44">Joh 6:44,64-66</a></dl>
<dt><a name="4"></a>
<b><i>6:4 For [it is] impossible for those who<br>
were once enlightened, and<br>
have tasted of the heavenly gift, and<br>
were made partakers of the Holy Ghost,</i></b></dt><dl>
<dt><a href="heb6.htm#4" target="lwr_lt">Vs.4-8</a> are difficult to understand at first reading.
<dd> &quot;it is impossible... if they fall away... to renew them again...&quot;
<dt>What does this mean?<ol>
<li>Can Christians lose their salvation? Many other passages say, &quot;No.&quot;<br>
<a href="joh10.htm#27">Joh 10:27-30</a>; <a href="rom8.htm#33">Rom 8:33-39</a>; <a href="eph1.htm#12">Eph 1:12-14</a>; <a href="php1.htm#6">Php 1:6</a>; <a href="1pet1.htm#3">1Pet 1:3-5</a><br>
(and also the end of this chapter, <a href="heb6.htm#13" target="lwr_lt">Heb 6:13-20</a>).
<li>Is this merely a hypothetical case?<br>
&quot;If&quot; they shall fall away (<a href="heb6.htm#6" target="lwr_lt">v.6</a>), assuming for the sake of argument that it were possible to do so, in that case, they could not be restored.
<li>Is the loss experienced, by those who &quot;stumble&quot; (as some would read 'fall away,' in v.6),<br>
loss of reward rather than loss of salvation? (cp. vs.7,8 with <a href="1cor3.htm#11">1Cor 3:11-15</a>)
<li>Are those who &quot;fall away&quot; merely professing but not possessing a relationship to Christ?
<li>Is this passage limited to first century Jews, who had once professed Jesus as their Messiah, but were now in danger of forsaking Him to return to the sacrificial system of the Temple?</ol>
<dt>These verses must be seen in the context of the passage: the writer's concern
<dd>that his readers have not matured beyond the &quot;first principles&quot; (vs.1-3).
<dd>Could their immaturity mean that they are not true children of God?
<dt>Where are the <i>evidences of Maturity</i>? (lettered points through v.8)<ol type="A">
<li>Assimilation of &quot;strong meat.&quot; (<a href="heb5.htm#12">5:12-6:3</a>)
<dd>A lack of appetite for, and application of, the Word of God contributes to slow spiritual growth, but may also indicate a lack of spiritual life (<a href="1pet2.htm#2">1Pet 2:2</a>).<dt>
<li>Continuation in the truth. (<a href="heb6.htm#4" target="lwr_lt">6:4-6</a>)</ol>
<dt>The descriptive phrases of vs.4,5 could apply equally...
<dd>to true believers, or to the unsaved who associate with believers.
<dd>The wheat and tares will grow together until the Lord separates them. <a href="mat13.htm#24">Mat 13:24-30,36-43</a>
<dt>once enlightened- or, once for all enlightened.
<dd>Daylight may flood the eyes of both sighted and blind, but the blind do not benefit. <a href="2cor4.htm#3">2Cor 4:3,4</a>
<dt>tasted- GK=geoumai, to taste, to eat.
<dd>The one who tastes may, or may not, eat. <a href="joh6.htm#47">Joh 6:47-60,66</a>
<dt>partakers- GK=metochos, those who 'have with,' sharers.
<dd>Believers are indwelt by the Holy Spirit.
<dd>The unsaved, who dwell among believers, also benefit from His presence:
<dd>Even the unsaved church-goer enjoys a more stable life &amp; home than his peers who invest their lives in alcohol, drugs and other vices. cp. <a href="1cor7.htm#14">1Cor 7:14</a></dl>
<dt><b><i>6:5 And have tasted the good word of God,<br>
and the powers of the world to come,</i></b>
<dd>tasted-GK=geuomai, to taste, to eat. Again, to taste is not necessarily to eat.
<dd>the word...the powers- even those who neglect God's salvation are exposed to its evidences. <a href="heb2.htm#2">Heb 2:2-4</a>
<dt><b><i>6:6 If they shall fall away, to renew them again unto repentance;<br>
seeing they crucify to themselves the Son of God afresh,<br>
and put [him] to an open shame.</i></b></dt><dl>
<dt>fall away- GK=parapipto, to stumble, to fall down.
<dd>The true child of God will continue in the faith unto the end.
<dd>cp. <a href="1joh2.htm#19">1Joh 2:19</a>; <a href="1cor1.htm#8">1Cor 1:8</a>; <a href="heb3.htm#6">Heb 3:6,14</a>
<dd>Also see references at v.4 note (point # 1) above, and <a href="heb3an.htm#6" target="lwr_lt">note at 3:6</a>.
<dt>crucify... afresh-<ol type="(1)">
<li>A person who gives intellectual assent to Christ's Person &amp; Work, but who later rejects Him, is essentially endorsing His sentence of crucifixion. (Thus, putting Him to &quot;an open shame.&quot;)  <dd>cp. <a href="mat26.htm#65">Mat 26:65,66</a>; <a href="mat27.htm#22">27:22,23</a><dt>
Such persons might be mere professors (v.4 point # 4), or early Jews who initially embraced Jesus as Messiah, but not as Savior (v.4 point # 5). They turned away from Him when expected political or material benefits did not materialize.
<li>Having rejected the Savior, there is no alternate means of salvation.
<dd><a href="joh6.htm#66">Joh 6:66-69</a>; <a href="joh15.htm#6">15:6</a>; <a href="heb10.htm#26">Heb 10:26-29</a>; <a href="heb12.htm#15">12:15-17</a>; <a href="2pet2.htm#20">2Pet 2:20-22</a><dt></ol></dl>
<dt><b><i>6:7 For the earth which drinketh in the rain that cometh oft upon it,<br>
and bringeth forth herbs meet for them by whom it is dressed,<br>
receiveth blessing from God:</i></b></dt><dl>
<dt>C. Production of good fruit (6:7,8) (An <i>evidence of Maturity</i>- see note at v.4)
<dt>the earth which drinketh in the rain... receiveth blessing- Rain falls on good &amp; bad fields. 
<dd>Some absorb, some squander the source of blessing.<br>The fields are judged according to their fruit.
<dd>Likewise, God's Word is intended to bless. <a href="isa55.htm#10">Isa 55:10-13</a>; <a href="joel2.htm#23">Joel 2:23-26</a><br>A man's condition is determined by the way he receives God's Word.</dl>
<dt><b><i>6:8 But that which beareth thorns and briers [is] rejected,<br>
and [is] nigh unto cursing;<br>
whose end [is] to be burned.</i></b></dt><dl>
<dt>rejected- GK=adokinos, castaway. cp. <a href="1cor9.htm#27">1Cor 9:27</a>
<dt>A lack of good fruit-
<dd>-- is an indication of no root in the Lord. <a href="mat13.htm#20">Mat 13:20-23</a>; <a href="joh15.htm#4">Joh 15:4-8</a>
<dd>-- is reason for judgment. <a href="isa5.htm#4">Isa 5:4-7</a>; <a href="mat7.htm#19">Mat 7:19,20</a>
<dt>Though the Word falls on all, and though it cuts to the heart (<a href="heb4.htm#12">4:12</a>),<dd>some hearts remain hardened. <a href="act5.htm#33">Acts 5:33</a>
<dt>vs.4-8 Are a Warning to the spiritually unreceptive: You are in danger of cursing.
<dd>There is mercy in the warning: The end is ''near'' but not yet fact. Therefore, Repent.</dl>
<dt><b><i>6:9 But, beloved, we are persuaded better things of you,<br>
and things that accompany salvation,<br>
though we thus speak.</i></b></dt><dl>
<dt><a href="heb6.htm#9" target="lwr_lt">vs.9-20</a> Are an Encouragement to those who are saved.
<dt>better- The argument of ch. 6 hinges around this word.
<dd>Though some had come near to Christ and then fallen away to eventual judgment, these had not fallen away but continued in the faith (which is far better).
<dd>Their lives exhibited evidences of spiritual life &amp; growth:
<dt>things that accompany salvation- namely:
<dd>(Lettered points in vs.10-12 are<i> evidences of Maturity,</i> corresponding to note at v.4 above, but listed here, in reverse order.)</dl>
<dd>C. Continuing Fruitfulness -<dt>
<b><i>6:10 For God [is] not unrighteous to forget your work and labour of love,<br>
which ye have shewed toward his name,<br>
in that ye have ministered to the saints, and do minister.</i></b>
<dd>work...- While salvation is not by works, the external evidence of fruitful service demonstrated the reality of their salvation. cp. <a href="1the1.htm#2">1The 1:2-7</a>
<br>&nbsp;
<dd>B. Continuing Confidence unto the end -<dt>
<b><i>6:11 And we desire that every one of you do shew the same diligence<br>
to the full assurance of hope unto the end:</i></b>
<dd>diligence... unto the end- cp. <a href="1cor15.htm#58">1Cor 15:58</a>; <a href="col1.htm#23">Col 1:23</a>; <a href="heb3.htm#6">Heb 3:6</a>; <a href="1pet1.htm#3">1Pet 1:3-5</a>; <a href="2pet1.htm#5">2Pet 1:5-10</a>
<dd>full assurance of hope- ie., confidence in God's sure provision for us in Christ. (The security of our salvation will be explained, in v.13-20.)
<br>&nbsp;
<dd>A. Continuing Maturation in the Faith -<dt>
<b><i>6:12 That ye be not slothful,<br>
but followers of them who through faith and patience inherit the promises.</i></b></dt><dl>
<dt>not slothful- ie., dull (cp. <a href="heb5.htm#11">5:11</a>, 'dull of hearing')
<dt>faith &amp; patience (GK=makrothumia, endurance, longsuffering)- imply an intense
<dd>appreciation for, and anticipation of, the fulfillment of God's announced purposes.
<dt>followers- ie., imitators. Consider the examples of-
<dd>-- Abraham's secure faith &amp; patience. (<a href="heb6.htm#13" target="lwr_lt">vs.13-15</a>)
<dd>-- Contemporary leaders in the faith. <a href="heb13.htm#7">Heb 13:7,8</a>
