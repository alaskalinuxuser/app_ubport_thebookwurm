<dl><dt>Chapter 12 records events of Jesus' last week of public ministry, just before His crucifixion.<br>
<dt><b><i>12:1  Then Jesus six days before the passover came to Bethany,<br>
where Lazarus was which had been dead, whom he raised from the dead.<br>
12:2  There they made him a supper; and Martha served:<br>
but Lazarus was one of them that sat at the table with him.<br>
12:3  Then took Mary a pound of ointment of spikenard, very costly,<br>
and anointed the feet of Jesus, and wiped his feet with her hair:<br>
and the house was filled with the odour of the ointment.</i></b></dt><dl>
<dt>This incident is also recorded in <a href="mat26.htm#6">Mat 26:6-13</a> and <a href="mar14.htm#3">Mark 14:3-9</a>,<dd>where we learn that it took place in 'the house of Simon the Leper.'
<dd>[Note that <a href="luk7.htm#36">Luke 7:36-50</a> records a different occasion, earlier in Jesus' ministry, hosted by a Pharisee named Simon. There, an unnamed woman acts in thanksgiving for sin forgiven, and Jesus is criticized for tolerating a disreputable person. Here, Mary acts in understanding of Jesus' teaching, and is rebuffed for her 'wasteful' act.]
<dt>Those present picture the relationship of the church to the Lord.<ul>
<li>Lazarus - the communion of new life. <dd>Not many days earlier, he had been dead, in the tomb, and cut off from sitting at the table with Jesus. Fellowship with Him is possible only by the Life which He gives. cp. <a href="eph2.htm#1">Eph 2:1</a>; <a href="rev3.htm#20">Rev 3:20</a><dt><li>Mary - worship. Worship expresses His worth by thought, word or action.<br>
Her worship --<ul><li>was very costly (<a href="joh12.htm#3" target="lwr_lt">v.3,5</a>).<li>was a fanatical waste, in the eyes of the world. (<a href="joh12.htm#5" target="lwr_lt">v.5</a>).<li>flowed from a right understanding of His word (<a href="joh12.htm#7" target="lwr_lt">v.7</a>).</ul><li>Martha - service. She did what she was gifted to do - for Him. <a href="luk10.htm#40">Luk 10:40-41</a><li>His disciples - identification with Jesus. There was risk involved in knowing Him (<a href="joh11.htm#57">11:57</a>).<dd>eg., Lazarus' identification with Jesus included: the witness of his life (<a href="joh12.htm#9" target="lwr_lt">v.9</a>), and the sentence of death (<a href="joh12.htm#10" target="lwr_lt">v.10,11</a>).</ul>
<dt>Mary... anointed the feet of Jesus- There is no conflict with <a href="mat26.htm#7">Mat 26:7</a>.
<dd>Customary hospitality included anointing of the feet and the head (cp. <a href="luk7.htm#46">Luk 7:46</a>).
<dd>Jesus saw her action as including everything from head to toe: She anointed &quot;my body.&quot; <a href="mat26.htm#12">Mat 26:12</a></dl><dt>
<b><i>12:4  Then saith one of his disciples,<br>
Judas Iscariot, Simon's [son], which should betray him,<br>
12:5  Why was not this ointment sold for three hundred pence, and given to the poor?<br>
12:6  This he said, not that he cared for the poor;<br>
but because he was a thief, and had the bag, and bare what was put therein.</i></b></dt><dl>
<dt>300 pence- ie., the annual wage of a laborer (cp. &quot;very costly,&quot; <a href="joh12.htm#3" target="lwr_lt">v.3</a>).
<dt>Judas... a thief- John knew this in retrospect. 
<dd>The disciples did not suspect Judas of wrong doing, at the time. (<a href="joh6.htm#70">6:70,71</a>; <a href="joh13.htm#26">13:26-29</a>)
<dd>As the treasurer of the group, Judas was entrusted with the money bag.</dl><dt>
<b><i>12:7  Then said Jesus, Let her alone:<br>
against the day of my burying hath she kept this.<br>
12:8  For the poor always ye have with you;</i></b> {<a href="deu15.htm#11">Deu 15:11</a>; <a href="mar14.htm#7">Mark 14:7</a>}<br>
<b><i>but me ye have not always.</i></b> {<a href="joh12.htm#35">Joh 12:35</a>; <a href="joh13.htm#33">13:33</a>; <a href="joh17.htm#11">17:11</a>}<br></dt><dl>
<dt>against... my burying...- <dd><ul>
<li>&quot;Having heard that He was to die, she purchased a costly spikenard to assist in the embalming of His body; but instructed by the resurrection of Lazarus, and hearing that Jesus was Himself the Resurrection and the Life, learning that He was to rise on the third day, and recognizing that embalmment would be needless, she poured it out on His living body, and so testified her belief in the resurrection.&quot; [GWms]
<li>Mary was the only disciple to understand His teaching regarding His death and resurrection before it was accomplished. Her early understanding of concepts central to the Gospel message would not be forgotten. <a href="mat26.htm#13">Mat 26:13</a>
<li>Mary of Bethany was not among the women who later would approach His tomb with spices. The others were too late, for they had not been attentive to His word.</ul></dl><dt>
<b><i>12:9  Much people of the Jews therefore knew that he was there:<br>
and they came not for Jesus' sake only,<br>
but that they might see Lazarus also, whom he had raised from the dead.<br>
12:10  But the chief priests consulted that they might put Lazarus also to death;<br>
12:11  Because that by reason of him many of the Jews went away, and believed on Jesus.</i></b></dt><dl>
<dt>the chief priests consulted...- and Judas covenanted with them.<dd>Apparently, Judas rebelled at Jesus' response to his protest. cp. <a href="mat26.htm#13">Mat 26:13-16</a>; <a href="mar14.htm#9">Mark 14:9-11</a>
<dt>many... believed...- cp. <a href="joh11.htm#45">11:45</a>; <a href="joh2.htm#23">2:23-25</a></dl><dt>
<b><i>12:12  On the next day much</b></i> {many} <b><i>people that were come to the feast,<br>
when they heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem,<br>
12:13  Took branches of palm trees, and went forth to meet him,<br>
and cried, Hosanna</b></i> {ie., ''save now''}<b><i>:<br>
Blessed [is] the King of Israel that cometh in the name of the Lord.</b></i></dt><dl>
<dt>the next day- ie., five days before Passover (<a href="joh12.htm#1" target="lwr_lt">v.1</a>).
<dt>Jesus... coming to Jerusalem- Jesus presents Himself publicly as the King.
<dd>This is often called the &quot;Triumphal Entry,&quot; but Jesus wept at Israel's unbelief.
<dd>cp. <a href="mat21.htm#1">Mat 21:1-9</a>; <a href="mat23.htm#37">23:37-39</a>; <a href="luk19.htm#29">Luk 19:29-44</a>
<dd>Many of those who acclaimed Him here, would soon turn against Him. cp. <a href="joh19.htm#14">19:14,15</a><br>
<dt>Note the prophetic significance -<ol type="1">
<li>The words of the people are quoted from <a href="psa118.htm#25">Psa 118:25,26</a>.<br>
This is the last of the Hallel Psalms which were sung annually at Israel's major feasts.<br>
The Psalm spoke prophetically of the Messiah's work of salvation. Jesus would accomplish that salvation at this Passover. Though the nation rejected and crucified Him, these words would continue to echo in the Temple, over the next 40 years, as testimony to the rejected Messiah.
<li>His action fulfilled <a href="zech9.htm#9">Zechariah 9:9</a> -</ol></dl><dt>
<b><i>12:14  And Jesus, when he had found a young ass, sat thereon; as it is written,<br>
12:15  Fear not, daughter of Sion: behold, thy King cometh, sitting on an ass's colt.<br>
12:16  These things understood not his disciples at the first:<br>
but when Jesus was glorified, then remembered they that these things were written of him,<br>
and [that] they had done these things unto him.</b></i></dt><dl>
<dt>written of Him- He is the theme of Scripture. cp. <a href="joh5.htm#39">5:39</a>
<dt>then they remembered- The Holy Spirit would call these things to  their minds. cp. <a href="joh14.htm#26">14:26</a>; <a href="joh16.htm#12">16:12-14</a></dl><dt>
<b><i>12:17  The people therefore that was with him when he called Lazarus out of his grave,<br>
and raised him from the dead, bare record.<br>
12:18  For this cause the people also met him,<br>
for that they heard that he had done this miracle.<br>
12:19  The Pharisees therefore said among themselves,<br>
Perceive ye how ye prevail nothing? </i></b>
<dd>{ie., Their campaign against Jesus seemed to be faultering. cp. <a href="joh11.htm#47">11:47-50,57</a>}<i><b><dt>
behold, the world is gone after him.</i></b></dt><dl>
<dt>His wide popularity among the Jews troubled them.
<dd>They were probably unaware that some from other nations sought Him:<br>
- - At His birth, Persians from the east (the magi, <a href="mat2.htm#1">Mat 2:1,2</a>),<br>
- - At the end of His ministry, Greeks from the west (v.20). . .</dl><dt>
<b><i>12:20  And there were certain Greeks among them that came up to worship at the feast:<br>
12:21  The same came therefore to Philip, which was of Bethsaida of Galilee,<br>
and desired him, saying, Sir, we would see Jesus.<br>
12:22  Philip cometh and telleth Andrew: and again Andrew and Philip tell Jesus.</i></b></dt><dl>
<dt>Greeks {ie., Gentiles}... came to Philip...-
<dd>Why didn't they approach Jesus directly?<ul><li>Perhaps Jesus was in the Temple, where gentiles could not approach?
<li>Perhaps they were more comfortable with approaching Philip.
<br>'Philip' is a Greek name. His family may have had business dealings with Greeks. Perhaps he was fluent in the Greek language.</ul>
<dt>Philip, uncertain concerning their request (cp. <a href="mat10.htm#5">Mat 10:5-7</a>),<dd>conferred with Andrew before telling Jesus.</dl><dt>
<b><i>12:23  And Jesus answered them, saying,<br>
The hour is come, that the Son of man should be glorified.<br>
12:24  Verily, verily, I say unto you,<br>
Except a corn</b></i> {grain, seed} <b><i>of wheat fall into the ground and die, it abideth alone:<br>
but if it die, it bringeth forth much fruit.</i></b></dt><dl>
<dt>Jesus answered them...- We are not told whether or not Jesus spoke to the Greeks.
<dd>He had just presented Himself as King, to Israel. But because Israel had officially rejected Him,
the Kingdom would not come, at this time. The Greeks would not be benefited in seeking Him as King of the Jews. They needed &quot;the Savior of the world&quot; (cp. <a href="joh4.htm#42">4:42</a>). 
<dt>The hour is come...- cp. <a href="joh2.htm#4">2:4</a>; <a href="joh4.htm#21">4:21,23</a>; <a href="joh7.htm#30">7:30</a>; <a href="joh8.htm#20">8:20</a>; <a href="joh13.htm#1">13:1</a>; <a href="joh17.htm#1">17:1,5</a>
<dd>The gentile request to ''see Jesus'' seems to be a road sign to Him.<br>
From this point onward, He is no longer offering the Kingdom.<br>
Rather, He prepares the disciples for His crucifixion and resurrection.<br>
He speaks of the necessity of His death, through which all nations will be blessed.<br>
It is for this work that He came into the world.<br>
He will be glorified in its accomplishment. <a href="isa49.htm#5">Isa 49:5,6</a>
<dt>the Son of man... glorified- 
<dd>As the Son of God, His glory was shown in the resurrection of Lazarus. <a href="joh11.htm#4">11:4</a><br>
As the Son of David, His glory was acclaimed as He rode into Jerusalem. <a href="joh12.htm#13" target="lwr_lt">v.13</a><br>
As the Son of man, He must die to bring many sons unto glory. <a href="heb2.htm#9">Heb 2:9,10</a> [adapted from GWms]
<dt>Except a grain of wheat {ie., a seed}... die...- Jesus is the seed that<i> must </i>die.
<dd>(He gave this illustration to show the absolute necessity of His death and burial.)<ul>
<li>...it abides alone.- Apart from His death, the Life that was in Him (<a href="joh1.htm#4">1:4</a>) would never provide eternal life for others.
<li>but if it die, it brings forth much fruit.- The redeemed are His &quot;much fruit.&quot;<br>
By means of His death, His life springs up within believers<br>(who then become His 'seed' carrying His life to others). cp. <a href="psa22.htm#1">Psa 22:1,15,22,30</a>; <a href="isa53.htm#10">Isa 53:10,11</a></ul></dl><dt>
<b><i>12:25  He that loveth his life shall lose it;<br>
and he that hateth his life in this world shall keep it unto life eternal.<br>
12:26  If any man serve me, let him follow me;<br>
and where I am, there shall also my servant be:<br>
if any man serve me, him will [my] Father honour.</i></b></dt><dl>
<dt>If any man serve me...- Jesus' selfless death, besides being redemptive, is also instructive.<dd>He calls each individual, who would be His disciple, to...<ul>
<li>die to self, <a href="joh12.htm#25" target="lwr_lt">v.25</a>. cp. <a href="2cor5.htm#14">2Cor 5:14,15</a>; <a href="gal6.htm#14">Gal 6:14</a>
<li>follow Me, <a href="joh12.htm#26" target="lwr_lt">v.26a</a>. - He was enroute to the cross. cp. <a href="mat16.htm#24">Mat 16:24-27</a>
<li>be where I am, v.26b. - ie., joined to Him in death and in life, in sufferings and in glory.<br>cp. <a href="gal2.htm#20">Gal 2:20</a>; <a href="rom8.htm#17">Rom 8:17</a>; <a href="2tim2.htm#11">2Tim 2:11,12</a></ul></dl><dt>
<b><i>12:27  Now is my soul troubled; and what shall I say?<br>
Father, save me from this hour: but for this cause came I unto this hour.<br>
12:28  Father, glorify thy name. </i></b></dt><dl>
<dt>troubled {ie., distressed, disquieted} - cp. this word in <a href="joh11.htm#33">11:33</a>; <a href="joh14.htm#1">14:1</a>.
<dt>this hour...- ie., the hour of His redemptive death.
<dd>He is inwardly repulsed as He anticipates <a href="psa22.htm#1">Psa 22:1</a>; <a href="2cor5.htm#21">2Cor 5:21</a>.
<dd>We cannot begin to comprehend the suffering that He bore for us.<ul>
<li>&quot;But none of the ransomed ever knew, <dd>how deep were the waters crossed,<dt>
or how dark was the night that the Lord passed through, <dd>e'er He found His sheep that was lost.&quot; [hymn: 'The Ninety and Nine']</ul>
<dt>Father, glorify Thy name- cp. <a href="mat26.htm#38">Mat 26:38,39,42</a></dl><dt>
<b><i>Then came there a voice from heaven, [saying],<br>
I have both glorified [it], and will glorify [it] again. </b></i>{<a href="isa49.htm#1">Isa 49:1-7</a>; <a href="joh13.htm#31">Joh 13:31,32</a>}<b><i><br>
12:29  The people therefore, that stood by, and heard [it], said that it thundered:<br>
others said, An angel spake to him.<br>
12:30  Jesus answered and said,<br>This voice came not because of me, but for your sakes.</b></i> {cp. <a href="joh11.htm#41">11:41,42</a>}<b><i><br>
12:31  Now is the judgment of this world:<br>
now shall the prince of this world be cast out.<br>
12:32  And I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all [men] unto me.<br>
12:33  This he said, signifying what death he should die.</i></b></dt><dl>
<dt>now is the judgment...- On the cross, Christ bore the judgment for sin.
<dd><ul><li>His death provides justification for the believer.<br>cp. <a href="joh5.htm#24">5:24</a>; <a href="gal3.htm#13">Gal 3:13</a>; <a href="heb9.htm#27">Heb 9:27,28</a>; <a href="heb10.htm#10">10:10,14-17</a>; <a href="1pet2.htm#24">1Pet 2:24</a>; <a href="1pet3.htm#18">3:18</a>
<li>His death renders Satan powerless over the redeemed. <a href="heb2.htm#14">Heb 2:14</a>; cp. <a href="joh14.htm#30">Joh 14:30</a></ul>
<dt>I... if {ie., because} I be lifted up...- cp. <a href="joh3.htm#14">3:14,15</a>

But salvation is not for the Jews only. Christ's sacrificial death and resurrection would provide salvation for Jew and Gentile alike (<a href="rom1.htm#16">Rom 1:16</a>). This was the great need of the Greeks who sought Him (<a href="joh12.htm#20" target="lwr_lt">v.20-22</a>)
<dd>But, not <i>every man</i> will be saved. cp. <a href="joh5.htm#28">5:28,29</a>; <a href="joh1.htm#11">1:11,12</a>; <a href="mat20.htm#28">Mat 20:28</a>
