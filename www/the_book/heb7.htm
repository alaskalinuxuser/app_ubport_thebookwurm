Hebrews   7<br> 1. For this Melchisedec, king of Salem, priest of the most high God, who met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings, and blessed him;<br><a name="2">2</a>  To whom also Abraham gave a tenth part of all; first being by interpretation King of righteousness, and after that also King of Salem, which is, King of peace;<br><a name="3">3</a>  Without father, without mother, without descent, having neither beginning of days, nor end of life; but made like unto the Son of God; abideth a priest continually.<br><a name="4">4</a>  Now consider how great this man [was], unto whom even the patriarch Abraham gave the tenth of the spoils.<br><a name="5">5</a>  And verily they that are of the sons of Levi, who receive the office of the priesthood, have a commandment to take tithes of the people according to the law, that is, of their brethren, though they come out of the loins of Abraham:<br><a name="6">6</a>  But he whose descent is not counted from them received tithes of Abraham, and blessed him that had the promises.<br><a name="7">7</a>  And without all contradiction the less is blessed of the better.<br><a name="8">8</a>  And here men that die receive tithes; but there he [receiveth them], of whom it is witnessed that he liveth.<br><a name="9">9</a>  And as I may so say, Levi also, who receiveth tithes, payed tithes in Abraham.<br><a name="10">10</a>  For he was yet in the loins of his father, when Melchisedec met him.<br><a name="11">11</a>. If therefore perfection were by the Levitical priesthood, (for under it the people received the law,) what further need [was there] that another priest should rise after the order of Melchisedec, and not be called after the order of Aaron?<br><a name="12">12</a>  For the priesthood being changed, there is made of necessity a change also of the law.<br><a name="13">13</a>  For he of whom these things are spoken pertaineth to another tribe, of which no man gave attendance at the altar.<br><a name="14">14</a>  For [it is] evident that our Lord sprang out of Juda; of which tribe Moses spake nothing concerning priesthood.<br><a name="15">15</a>  And it is yet far more evident: for that after the similitude of Melchisedec there ariseth another priest,<br><a name="16">16</a>  Who is made, not after the law of a carnal commandment, but after the power of an endless life.<br><a name="17">17</a>  For he testifieth, Thou [art] a priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec.<br><a name="18">18</a>  For there is verily a disannulling of the commandment going before for the weakness and unprofitableness thereof.<br><a name="19">19</a>  For the law made nothing perfect, but the bringing in of a better hope [did]; by the which we draw nigh unto God.<br><a name="20">20</a>  And inasmuch as not without an oath [he was made priest]:<br><a name="21">21</a>  (For those priests were made without an oath; but this with an oath by him that said unto him, The Lord sware and will not repent, Thou [art] a priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec:)<br><a name="22">22</a>  By so much was Jesus made a surety of a better testament.<br><a name="23">23</a>  And they truly were many priests, because they were not suffered to continue by reason of death:<br><a name="24">24</a>  But this [man], because he continueth ever, hath an unchangeable priesthood.<br><a name="25">25</a>  Wherefore he is able also to save them to the uttermost that come unto God by him, seeing he ever liveth to make intercession for them.<br><a name="26">26</a>  For such an high priest became us, [who is] holy, harmless, undefiled, separate from sinners, and made higher than the heavens;<br><a name="27">27</a>  Who needeth not daily, as those high priests, to offer up sacrifice, first for his own sins, and then for the people's: for this he did once, when he offered up himself.<br><a name="28">28</a>  For the law maketh men high priests which have infirmity; but the word of the oath, which was since the law, [maketh] the Son, who is consecrated for evermore.<br><br>Go to <a href="heb8.htm#1">Hebrews 8</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
