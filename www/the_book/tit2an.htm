<dt><b><i>1. But speak thou the things which become sound doctrine:</b></i></dt><dl>
<dt>...the things which become {ie.; befit, are distinctive to} sound doctrine...
<dd>In contrast to the false teachers and their ungodly way of life, Titus was to encourage a way of life that was befitting to 'the sound doctrine' {ie., the healthy teachings} of the true Faith (ie., the doctrine of the apostles, <a href="act2.htm#42">Acts 2:42</a>). 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sound doctrine consists of the whole counsel of God (the Bible), including the foundational truths of the Gospel (eg., <a href="tit1.htm#9">Titus 1:9</a>). These truths must be taught, not merely as intellectual knowledge, but as the foundation upon which a godly life is built. The Gospel which we profess ought to have a profound effect upon the way we live, for we have been set free from sin to serve the holy God (<a href="tit2.htm#11" target="lwr_lt">Titus 2:11-14</a>). Unholy living is inconsistent with God's Word (<a href="1tim1.htm#10">1Tim 1:10</a>; <a href="1tim6.htm#3">6:3</a>).
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The instructions, in this paragraph, are directed to the pastor (&quot;but speak thou...&quot;), who in turn instructs his flock in the way of righteousness, applying the instruction pimarily to the interaction between believers, in various walks of life...</dl>
<dt><b><i>2 That the aged men be sober, grave, temperate, sound in faith, in charity, in patience.<br>
3 The aged women likewise, that [they be] in behaviour as becometh holiness,<br>not false accusers, not given to much wine, teachers of good things;<br>
4 That they may teach the young women to be sober,<br>to love their husbands, to love their children,<br>
5 [To be] discreet, chaste, keepers at home,<br>good, obedient to their own husbands,<br>that the word of God be not blasphemed.<br>

<dt>...that the aged men {GK=presbutes, elders, old men}...-
<dd>In <a href="tit1.htm#5">1:5</a>, the same word for 'elders' referred to men who were to be appointed to serve as 'bishops' {'overseers'} of the church. Here, this word refers to all of the older men, even those who were not officers of the church. Whether or not a older man holds an office, his life is to measure up to the characteristics required of 'bishops' and 'deacons.' They ought to be...<ul>
<li>sober {GK=nephalius, temperate, vigilant}... - (like office holders: <a href="1tim3.htm#2">1Tim 3:2,11</a>)
<li>grave {GK=semnos, reverend, serious}...-  (like deacons and wives: <a href="1tim3.htm#8">1Tim 3:8,11</a>)
<li>temperate {GK=sophron, soberminded}...- (like office holders: <a href="1tim3.htm#2">1Tim 3:2</a>; <a href="tit1.htm#8">Titus 1:8</a> rendered 'sober' in both places)
<li>sound in faith {lit., 'the faith'}...- Like office holders (<a href="tit1.htm#9">Titus 1:9,13</a>), the older men should be well grounded in the Word.
<li>...in charity {lit., 'the love,' GK=agape}... (like Paul, motivated by Christ's love, <a href="2cor5.htm#14">2Cor 5:14</a>; <a href="eph3.htm#19">Eph 3:19</a>)
<li>...in patience {lit., 'the patience,' GK=hupomone, endurance}... (like Paul, enduring hardship for the sake of others, <a href="2cor1.htm#6">2Cor 1:6</a>)</ul>
<dt>...the aged women {GK=presbutis, the feminine form of presbutes} likewise...
<dd>The older women also ought to be characterized by godly lives...<ul>
<li>in behaviour {ie., constitution, deportment} as becometh holiness (<a href="1tim2.htm#9">1Tim 2:9,10</a>)
<li>not false accusers {GK=diabolos, slanderers, <a href="1tim3.htm#11">1Tim 3:11</a>} - in speech, not doing the work of Satan, the 'accuser.'
<li>not given {lit., not a slave} to much wine - While 'a little wine' had some medicinal value (<a href="
1tim5.htm#23">1Tim 5:23</a>), the destructive influence of 'much wine' ought not to characterize any believer's life (cf. <a href="tit1.htm#7">Tit 1:7</a>).
<li>teachers of good things {GK=kalodidaskalos, a teacher of what is good} - Such teaching is by word and example.</ul>
<dt>...that they may teach the young women...
<dd>Older women must be of godly character in order to train the next generation in the way of godliness.
<br>As pastor, Titus' ministry to the younger women, was to be in care of the older women, for the sake of purity (<a href="1tim5.htm#2">1Tim 5:2</a>). Yet, he had responsibility to ensure that the younger women were instructed...<ul>
<li>to be sober - The words &quot;they might teach... to be sober&quot; are the translation of one word {GK=sophronizo, cause to be of sound mind}. This is training by the life example of godly women.
<li>to 'love their husbands' {GK=philandros, to be fond of their man, to be affectionate}
<li>to love their children {GK=philoteknos, to be affectionate toward their offspring} <a href="1tim5.htm#14">1Tim 5:14</a>
<li>to be discreet {GK=sophron, to be sober minded, self-controlled} (rendered 'temperate' in <a href="tit2.htm#2" target="lwr_lt">v.2</a>) 
<li>chaste {GK=hagnos, pure, free from carnality} <a href="2cor11.htm#2">2Cor 11:2</a>; <a href="1pet3.htm#2">1Pet 3:2</a>; <a href="1joh3.htm#3">1Joh 3:3</a> (where it is rendered as 'pure') 
<li>keepers at home {GK=oikourgous, workers at home} - A 'stay at home mom' is not an idle occupation (<a href="1tim5.htm#13">1Tim 5:13,14</a>). The young wife and mother is engaged in the work of homemaking and child training. Her work encourages her husband, freeing him to fulfill his work. Her work strengthens the foundational institution of society, the family, as she teaches the next generation of fathers and mothers, to love and fear God and to honor the king. <a href="pro31.htm#10">Prov 31:10-31</a>
<li>good {GK=agothos, good, beneficial}
<li>obedient {GK=hupotasso, ranked under, submissive} to their own husbands...- She is to recognize and arrange herself in accord with the order prescribed by God (<a href="1cor11.htm#3">1Cor 11:3</a>; <a href="eph5.htm#22">Eph 5:22-24,33</a>; <a href="col3.htm#18">Col 3:18</a>; <a href="1pet3.htm#1">1Pet 3:1-5</a>). Unsaved woman chafe at this concept (<a href="rom8.htm#7">Rom 8:7</a>).
<li>...that the word of God be not blasphemed. - A young woman, who professes to know Christ, but who is not living a godly life befitting to the Gospel (as described in all of the above points), invites the world to blaspheme {speak reproachfully of} the Lord, whom she claims to serve (<a href="1tim5.htm#14">1Tim 5:14</a>; <a href="1tim6.htm#1">6:1</a>).</ul>
<dt>Young men likewise exhort to be sober minded {GK=sophroneo, of sound mind}.<br>
<dt>...in all things shewing {GK=phroneo, providing, offering} thyself a pattern {GK=tupos, imprint}of good works...
<dd>Titus was to 'exhort' {GK=parakaleo, call to one's side} young men, by presenting his own godly life as an example before them.
<dd>...in doctrine [shewing]...<ul>
<li>...uncorruptness {GK=adiapthoria, purity (the opposite of progressive ruin and decay)} - This refers not only to the purity of the truth which one believes, but also to a life that is consistent with that truth.
<li>...gravity {GK=semnotes, dignity, seriousness, honesty} <a href="tit2.htm#2" target="lwr_lt">v.2</a>; <a href="1tim2.htm#2">1Tim 2:2</a>; <a href="1tim3.htm#4">3:4</a>
<li>...sincerity {GK=aphthoria, (related to 'uncorruptness' in this same verse), free from taint}</ul>
<dd>...(in) sound speech {ie., healthy words}, that cannot be condemned...-<ul>
<li> Titus was to be an example in life and word. His tongue must not speak harmfully, inconsistent with the healthy truth which it proclaimed. <a href="1tim6.htm#3">1Tim 6:3</a>; <a href="jam3.htm#8">Jam 3:8-10</a></ul>
<dd>...that he that is of the contrary part {GK=enantios, antagonistic, opposed to the truth} may be ashamed {GK=entrepo, lit., turned in} having no evil thing to say of you. - When young Christian men live and speak according to the Gospel which they profess, the arguments raised by the enemies of the Gospel are turned against themselves. <a href="1pet2.htm#12">1Pet 2:12,15</a>; <a href="1pet3.htm#16">3:16</a>
<dt>[Exhort] servants...<ul> 
<li>to be obedient {GK=hupotasso, ranking themselves under, submissive} unto their own masters, 
<li>to please [them] well in all [things] - A servant is to serve his master, not himself.
<li>not answering again {GK=antilego, speaking back, gainsaying, contradicting}-<dd>ie., Obeying instructions without complaint or argument.</dd>
<li>not purloining {GK=nosphizo, keeping back, setting aside (for oneself)}-<dd>Serving honestly, without pilfering or stealing. This word is used of Ananias and Saphira, who 'kept back' some of what belonged to their Master (<a href="act5.htm#2">Acts 5:2,3</a>).</dd>
<li>but shewing all good fidelity {ie.; demonstrating beneficial faithfulness}; <a href="1cor4.htm#2">1Cor 4:2</a>; <a href="eph6.htm#5">Eph 6:5-8</a>
<li>that they may adorn {GK=kosmeo} the doctrine of God our Saviour in all things. <a href="1tim6.htm#1">1Tim 6:1,2</a>
<dd>In every walk of life (old men, old women, young men, young women, servants...) the godly lives of believers enhance the beauty of the Gospel in the eyes of the watching world. The reason and basis for godly living is further explained in the remainder of the chapter.</dd></ul></dl>
<dt><b><i>11. For the grace of God that bringeth salvation hath appeared to all men,<br>
12 Teaching us that, denying ungodliness and worldly lusts,<br>we should live soberly, righteously, and godly, in this present world;<br>

14 Who gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity,<br>and purify unto himself a peculiar people, zealous of good works.<br>
15. These things speak, and exhort, and rebuke with all authority.<br>Let no man despise thee.</b></i></dt><dl>
<dt>God's purpose in salvation, is that the people whom He saves should eagerly desire to serve Him.
<dd>Note the three tenses of salvation, by which the Lord accomplishes this purpose:<ol type="1">
<li><b>Past:</b> The grace of God that bringeth salvation <b>hath appeared</b> {ie., 'shined forth'} to all men.-
<dd>While we were yet sinners, undeserving of God's favor, He took decisive action to provide the Way of Salvation. The word used here for 'salvation' is applied personally to the Savior in <a href="luk2.htm#30">Luk 2:30</a>; <a href="luk3.htm#6">3:6</a>. God's Grace {ie., undeserved favor} 'appeared to all men' when Christ came into the world to save sinners. At that time, Jesus, the Light of the World, 'shined forth' to lighten all men (<a href="joh1.htm#4">Joh 1:4-9,14,16-17</a>). God's Grace includes the price Christ paid to lift our debt of sin, enabling God to favor us, though we have no merit of our own (<a href="eph1.htm#6">Eph 1:6,7</a>; <a href="eph2.htm#8">2:8,9</a>; <a href="heb9.htm#25">Heb 9:25,26</a>).</dd>
<li><b>Present:</b> Teaching us... in this present world.
<dd>By God's Grace, believers are 'born again' as God's children (<a href="joh1.htm#11">Joh 1:11-13</a>). God's Grace 'teaches' {GK=paideou, to train children} His children how we are to live in order to please our Father, today, in this present world (<a href="1joh2.htm#27">1Joh 2:27</a>).<br> There are negative and positive aspects to His instruction:<ul>
<li>denying {ie., refusing, disowning} ungodliness and worldly lusts
<li>we should live soberly, righteously, and godly.
<br>The lives of God's children will be radically different than the children of this world. The difference is not due to 'behavior modification,' but rather due to 'heart transformation.' God's children will grow in their understanding of His ways, and increasingly desire to follow Him. Our way of life should match the new Life (the new nature) which we have received from our Father. <a href="rom6.htm#4">Rom 6:4-6,12,19</a>; <a href="rom8.htm#13">8:13-15</a>; <a href="eph4.htm#22">Eph 4:22-25</a></ul></dd>
<li><b>Future:</b> Looking for <b>that blessed hope...</b>
<dd>This present world is not the permanent home of God's children. Our Lord went to prepare a better place, and will soon return to take us to the Father's house (<a href="joh14.htm#1">Joh 14:1-3</a>; <a href="php3.htm#20">Php 3:20,21</a>; <a href="2tim4.htm#8">2Tim 4:8</a>.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Believers are 'looking for' {ie., 'expecting to receive'} our 'blessed' 'hope' {'happy' 'confident expectation'}, namely...</dd>
<dt><b>...</b>and {ie., <b>even</b>} <b>the glorious appearing of the great God and our Saviour Jesus Christ...</b>-
<dd>'The glorious appearing' is more literally 'the appearing of the glory of...' The glorious One who will 'appear' {ie., shine forth} is 'the great God and our Saviour Jesus Christ.' This statement is emphatic of the deity of Christ. <a href="mat16.htm#27">Mat 16:27</a>; <a href="mat25.htm#31">25:31</a>; <a href="mat26.htm#64">26:64</a>; <a href="isa25.htm#9">Isa 25:9</a></dd>
<dt><b>...who gave Himself for us...</b> - <a href="gal1.htm#4">Gal 1:4</a>; <a href="gal2.htm#20">2:20</a>; <a href="1pet1.htm#8">1Pet 1:8</a><dd>The glorious One for whom we watch, is the same Jesus who died for our sins (<a href="act1.htm#11">Acts 1:11</a>).</dd></ol>
<dd>God paid a great price for the salvation which He freely offers to all who trust in Christ. His purchase was intentional and purposeful...<ul>
<li>that he might redeem {ie, ransom by paying a price} us from all iniquity {ie., lawlessness, wickedness, unrighteousness}...
<dd>We were in bondage, as slaves to sin, but He purchased us with His blood in order to set us free from sin and our sinful nature (<a href="mat1.htm#21">Mat 1:21</a>; <a href="joh1.htm#29">Joh 1:29</a>; <a href="rom11.htm#26">Rom 11:26,27</a>). He lifted us out of our filth.
<li>and purify {GK=katharizo, purge, cleanse} unto himself a peculiar people, zealous of good works.
<dd>He removes the filth from within us (<a href="heb9.htm#14">Heb 9:14</a>), to prepare us to be His 'peculiar people' {ie., a people for His own possession} (<a href="1cor6.htm#19">1Cor 6:19,20</a>; <a href="1cor7.htm#23">7:23</a>; <a href="1pet2.htm#9">1Pet 2:9</a>; cf. <a href="ex19.htm#5">Ex 19:5,6</a>). Such people will be zealous {ie., eagerly desiring} to serve Him (<a href="eph2.htm#10">Eph 2:10</a>; <a href="2tim2.htm#21">2Tim 2:21</a>}.</dd></ul>
<dt>These things speak {the spoken word}, exhort {the side by side ministry and example}, rebuke {convince, convict, refute}.
<dd>Titus was to instruct God's people in godly living, befitting the Gospel, by means of public and private word and example, and with correction of error when needed.
<dt>...with all authority... -
<dd>The Word of God provides 'all authority' for the man of God (<a href="mar1.htm#22">Mark 1:22</a>; <a href="joh17.htm#17">Joh 17:17</a>; <a href="2tim3.htm#16">2Tim 3:16,17</a>). Therefore, he must not allow men to despise {GK=periphroneo, lit., to think around} clear biblical instruction or correction. (cf. <a href="1tim4.htm#12">1Tim 4:12</a>, where no man is to 'despise' {GK=kataphroneo, to think against, to think little of} the messenger.)
