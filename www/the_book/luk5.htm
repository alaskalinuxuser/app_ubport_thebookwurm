And it came to pass, that, as the people pressed upon him to hear the word of God, he stood by the lake of Gennesaret,<br><a name="2">2</a>  And saw two ships standing by the lake: but the fishermen were gone out of them, and were washing [their] nets.<br><a name="3">3</a>  And he entered into one of the ships, which was Simon's, and prayed him that he would thrust out a little from the land. And he sat down, and taught the people out of the ship.<br><a name="4">4</a>  Now when he had left speaking, he said unto Simon, Launch out into the deep, and let down your nets for a draught.<br><a name="5">5</a>  And Simon answering said unto him, Master, we have toiled all the night, and have taken nothing: nevertheless at thy word I will let down the net.<br><a name="6">6</a>  And when they had this done, they inclosed a great multitude of fishes: and their net brake.<br><a name="7">7</a>  And they beckoned unto [their] partners, which were in the other ship, that they should come and help them. And they came, and filled both the ships, so that they began to sink.<br><a name="8">8</a>  When Simon Peter saw [it], he fell down at Jesus' knees, saying, Depart from me; for I am a sinful man, O Lord.<br><a name="9">9</a>  For he was astonished, and all that were with him, at the draught of the fishes which they had taken:<br><a name="10">10</a>  And so [was] also James, and John, the sons of Zebedee, which were partners with Simon. And Jesus said unto Simon, Fear not; from henceforth thou shalt catch men.<br><a name="11">11</a>  And when they had brought their ships to land, they forsook all, and followed him.<br><a name="12">12</a>. And it came to pass, when he was in a certain city, behold a man full of leprosy: who seeing Jesus fell on [his] face, and besought him, saying, Lord, if thou wilt, thou canst make me clean.<br><a name="13">13</a>  And he put forth [his] hand, and touched him, saying, I will: be thou clean. And immediately the leprosy departed from him.<br><a name="14">14</a>  And he charged him to tell no man: but go, and shew thyself to the priest, and offer for thy cleansing, according as Moses commanded, for a testimony unto them.<br><a name="15">15</a>  But so much the more went there a fame abroad of him: and great multitudes came together to hear, and to be healed by him of their infirmities.<br><a name="16">16</a>  And he withdrew himself into the wilderness, and prayed.<br><a name="17">17</a>. And it came to pass on a certain day, as he was teaching, that there were Pharisees and doctors of the law sitting by, which were come out of every town of Galilee, and Judaea, and Jerusalem: and the power of the Lord was [present] to heal them.<br><a name="18">18</a>  And, behold, men brought in a bed a man which was taken with a palsy: and they sought [means] to bring him in, and to lay [him] before him.<br><a name="19">19</a>  And when they could not find by what [way] they might bring him in because of the multitude, they went upon the housetop, and let him down through the tiling with [his] couch into the midst before Jesus.<br><a name="20">20</a>  And when he saw their faith, he said unto him, Man, thy sins are forgiven thee.<br> <a name="21"></a>21  And the scribes and the Pharisees began to reason, saying, Who is this which speaketh blasphemies? Who can forgive sins, but God alone?<br><a name="22">22</a>  But when Jesus perceived their thoughts, he answering said unto them, What reason ye in your hearts?<br><a name="23">23</a>  Whether is easier, to say, Thy sins be forgiven thee; or to say, Rise up and walk?<br><a name="24">24</a>  But that ye may know that the Son of man hath power upon earth to forgive sins, (he said unto the sick of the palsy,) I say unto thee, Arise, and take up thy couch, and go into thine house.<br><a name="25">25</a>  And immediately he rose up before them, and took up that whereon he lay, and departed to his own house, glorifying God.<br><a name="26">26</a>  And they were all amazed, and they glorified God, and were filled with fear, saying, We have seen strange things to day.<br><a name="27">27</a>. And after these things he went forth, and saw a publican, named Levi, sitting at the receipt of custom: and he said unto him, Follow me.<br><a name="28">28</a>  And he left all, rose up, and followed him.<br><a name="29">29</a>  And Levi made him a great feast in his own house: and there was a great company of publicans and of others that sat down with them.<br><a name="30">30</a>  But their scribes and Pharisees murmured against his disciples, saying, Why do ye eat and drink with publicans and sinners?<br><a name="31">31</a>  And Jesus answering said unto them, They that are whole need not a physician; but they that are sick.<br><a name="32">32</a>  I came not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.<br><a name="33">33</a>  And they said unto him, Why do the disciples of John fast often, and make prayers, and likewise [the disciples] of the Pharisees; but thine eat and drink?<br><a name="34">34</a>  And he said unto them, Can ye make the children of the bridechamber fast, while the bridegroom is with them?<br><a name="35">35</a>  But the days will come, when the bridegroom shall be taken away from them, and then shall they fast in those days.<br><a name="36">36</a>  And he spake also a parable unto them; No man putteth a piece of a new garment upon an old; if otherwise, then both the new maketh a rent, and the piece that was [taken] out of the new agreeth not with the old.<br><a name="37">37</a>  And no man putteth new wine into old bottles; else the new wine will burst the bottles, and be spilled, and the bottles shall perish.<br><a name="38">38</a>  But new wine must be put into new bottles; and both are preserved.<br><a name="39">39</a>  No man also having drunk old [wine] straightway desireth new: for he saith, The old is better.<br><br>Go to <a href="luk6.htm#1">Luke 6</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
