2Samuel  15<br> 1. And it came to pass after this, that Absalom prepared him chariots and horses, and fifty men to run before him.<br><a name="2">2</a>  And Absalom rose up early, and stood beside the way of the gate: and it was [so], that when any man that had a controversy came to the king for judgment, then Absalom called unto him, and said, Of what city [art] thou? And he said, Thy servant [is] of one of the tribes of Israel.<br><a name="3">3</a>  And Absalom said unto him, See, thy matters [are] good and right; but [there is] no man [deputed] of the king to hear thee.<br><a name="4">4</a>  Absalom said moreover, Oh that I were made judge in the land, that every man which hath any suit or cause might come unto me, and I would do him justice!<br><a name="5">5</a>  And it was [so], that when any man came nigh [to him] to do him obeisance, he put forth his hand, and took him, and kissed him.<br><a name="6">6</a>  And on this manner did Absalom to all Israel that came to the king for judgment: so Absalom stole the hearts of the men of Israel.<br><a name="7">7</a>. And it came to pass after forty years, that Absalom said unto the king, I pray thee, let me go and pay my vow, which I have vowed unto the LORD, in Hebron.<br><a name="8">8</a>  For thy servant vowed a vow while I abode at Geshur in Syria, saying, If the LORD shall bring me again indeed to Jerusalem, then I will serve the LORD.<br><a name="9">9</a>  And the king said unto him, Go in peace. So he arose, and went to Hebron.<br><a name="10">10</a>  But Absalom sent spies throughout all the tribes of Israel, saying, As soon as ye hear the sound of the trumpet, then ye shall say, Absalom reigneth in Hebron.<br><a name="11">11</a>  And with Absalom went two hundred men out of Jerusalem, [that were] called; and they went in their simplicity, and they knew not any thing.<br><a name="12">12</a>  And Absalom sent for Ahithophel the Gilonite, David's counsellor, from his city, [even] from Giloh, while he offered sacrifices. And the conspiracy was strong; for the people increased continually with Absalom.<br><a name="13">13</a>. And there came a messenger to David, saying, The hearts of the men of Israel are after Absalom.<br><a name="14">14</a>  And David said unto all his servants that [were] with him at Jerusalem, Arise, and let us flee; for we shall not [else] escape from Absalom: make speed to depart, lest he overtake us suddenly, and bring evil upon us, and smite the city with the edge of the sword.<br><a name="15">15</a>  And the king's servants said unto the king, Behold, thy servants [are ready to do] whatsoever my lord the king shall appoint.<br><a name="16">16</a>  And the king went forth, and all his household after him. And the king left ten women, [which were] concubines, to keep the house.<br><a name="17">17</a>  And the king went forth, and all the people after him, and tarried in a place that was far off.<br><a name="18">18</a>  And all his servants passed on beside him; and all the Cherethites, and all the Pelethites, and all the Gittites, six hundred men which came after him from Gath, passed on before the king.<br><a name="19">19</a>  Then said the king to Ittai the Gittite, Wherefore goest thou also with us? return to thy place, and abide with the king: for thou [art] a stranger, and also an exile.<br><a name="20">20</a>  Whereas thou camest [but] yesterday, should I this day make thee go up and down with us? seeing I go whither I may, return thou, and take back thy brethren: mercy and truth [be] with thee.<br><a name="21">21</a>  And Ittai answered the king, and said, [As] the LORD liveth, and [as] my lord the king liveth, surely in what place my lord the king shall be, whether in death or life, even there also will thy servant be.<br><a name="22">22</a>  And David said to Ittai, Go and pass over. And Ittai the Gittite passed over, and all his men, and all the little ones that [were] with him.<br><a name="23">23</a>  And all the country wept with a loud voice, and all the people passed over: the king also himself passed over the brook Kidron, and all the people passed over, toward the way of the wilderness.<br><a name="24">24</a>. And lo Zadok also, and all the Levites [were] with him, bearing the ark of the covenant of God: and they set down the ark of God; and Abiathar went up, until all the people had done passing out of the city.<br><a name="25">25</a>  And the king said unto Zadok, Carry back the ark of God into the city: if I shall find favour in the eyes of the LORD, he will bring me again, and shew me [both] it, and his habitation:<br><a name="26">26</a>  But if he thus say, I have no delight in thee; behold, [here am] I, let him do to me as seemeth good unto him.<br><a name="27">27</a>  The king said also unto Zadok the priest, [Art not] thou a seer? return into the city in peace, and your two sons with you, Ahimaaz thy son, and Jonathan the son of Abiathar.<br><a name="28">28</a>  See, I will tarry in the plain of the wilderness, until there come word from you to certify me.<br><a name="29">29</a>  Zadok therefore and Abiathar carried the ark of God again to Jerusalem: and they tarried there.<br><a name="30">30</a>  And David went up by the ascent of [mount] Olivet, and wept as he went up, and had his head covered, and he went barefoot: and all the people that [was] with him covered every man his head, and they went up, weeping as they went up.<br><a name="31">31</a>. And [one] told David, saying, Ahithophel [is] among the conspirators with Absalom. And David said, O LORD, I pray thee, turn the counsel of Ahithophel into foolishness.<br><a name="32">32</a>  And it came to pass, that [when] David was come to the top [of the mount], where he worshipped God, behold, Hushai the Archite came to meet him with his coat rent, and earth upon his head:<br><a name="33">33</a>  Unto whom David said, If thou passest on with me, then thou shalt be a burden unto me:<br><a name="34">34</a>  But if thou return to the city, and say unto Absalom, I will be thy servant, O king; [as] I [have been] thy father's servant hitherto, so [will] I now also [be] thy servant: then mayest thou for me defeat the counsel of Ahithophel.<br><a name="35">35</a>  And [hast thou] not there with thee Zadok and Abiathar the priests? therefore it shall be, [that] what thing soever thou shalt hear out of the king's house, thou shalt tell [it] to Zadok and Abiathar the priests.<br><a name="36">36</a>  Behold, [they have] there with them their two sons, Ahimaaz Zadok's [son], and Jonathan Abiathar's [son]; and by them ye shall send unto me every thing that ye can hear.<br><a name="37">37</a>  So Hushai David's friend came into the city, and Absalom came into Jerusalem.<br><br>Go to <a href="2sam16.htm#1">II Samuel 16</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
