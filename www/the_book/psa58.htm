Psalms  58<br>1. To the chief Musician, Altaschith, Michtam of David. Do ye indeed speak righteousness, O congregation? do ye judge uprightly, O ye sons of men?<br><a name="2">2</a>  Yea, in heart ye work wickedness; ye weigh the violence of your hands in the earth.<br><a name="3">3</a>  The wicked are estranged from the womb: they go astray as soon as they be born, speaking lies.<br><a name="4">4</a>  Their poison [is] like the poison of a serpent: [they are] like the deaf adder [that] stoppeth her ear;<br><a name="5">5</a>  Which will not hearken to the voice of charmers, charming never so wisely.<br><a name="6">6</a>. Break their teeth, O God, in their mouth: break out the great teeth of the young lions, O LORD.<br><a name="7">7</a>  Let them melt away as waters [which] run continually: [when] he bendeth [his bow to shoot] his arrows, let them be as cut in pieces.<br><a name="8">8</a>  As a snail [which] melteth, let [every one of them] pass away: [like] the untimely birth of a woman, [that] they may not see the sun.<br><a name="9">9</a>  Before your pots can feel the thorns, he shall take them away as with a whirlwind, both living, and in [his] wrath.<br><a name="10">10</a>  The righteous shall rejoice when he seeth the vengeance: he shall wash his feet in the blood of the wicked.<br><a name="11">11</a>  So that a man shall say, Verily [there is] a reward for the righteous: verily he is a God that judgeth in the earth.<br><br>Go to <a href="psa59.htm#1">Psalm 59</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
