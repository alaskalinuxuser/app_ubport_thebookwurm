<dt>Purpose- John states his purpose for writing this gospel in <a href="joh20.htm#31">John 20:31</a>: <dd>&quot;But these are written, that ye might believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God;<br>and that believing ye might have life through His name.&quot;<dt><dt>
The composition and order of this book were carefully chosen to fulfill this purpose. Some distinquishing features include:<ul>
<li>Simple words, but profound concepts.<br>John is often thought of as the &quot;simple gospel,&quot; because it is written with a basic vocabulary. A beginning reader has no difficulty with phrases like: &quot;...you in me, and I in you&quot; (<a href="joh14.htm#20">14:20</a>). But who can fully digest the meaning of those words?
<li>Original material and fewer recorded miracles than the synoptic gospels (Matthew, Mark, Luke). Although the other gospels were available to the writer, approximately 90% of the material in this book is unique to John. Each of the eight miracles are set forth as signs (<a href="joh20.htm#30">20:30</a>) of some great truth, which is subsequently further developed.
<li>Chronological sequence with frequent markers showing...<ul>
<li>time (eg., &quot;the next day...&quot;; &quot;...and it was the Passover...&quot;)<br>
<li>location (eg., &quot;it was at Bethabara beyond Jordan...&quot;, <a href="joh1.htm#28">1:28</a>; &quot;...in Cana of Galilee...&quot;, <a href="joh2.htm#1">2:1</a>)</ul>
<li>Emphasis upon the Deity of Christ, yet, without diminishing His humanity.<ul>
<li>The words &quot;Son&quot;and &quot;Son of God&quot; are used more often than in the other gospels.<br>
<li>Only John records Christ's &quot;I Am...&quot; declarations. (see <a href="joh8.htm#58">8:58</a>; <a href="joh6.htm#35">6:35</a>; <a href="joh8.htm#12">8:12</a>; <a href="joh10.htm#7">10:7,11</a>; <a href="joh11.htm#25">11:25</a>; <a href="joh14.htm#6">14:6</a>; <a href="joh15.htm#1">15:1</a>).</ul>
Yet, Christ is presented with very human characteristics:<ul>
<li>He became weary &amp; thirsty on a journey (<a href="joh4.htm#6">4:6,7</a>).<br>
<li>He wept at the death of a friend (<a href="joh11.htm#33">11:33-36</a>).<br>
<li>His human name, Jesus, is used almost exclusively (rather than His title, Christ).</ul>
Why? Because, God became a man. (<a href="joh1.htm#14" target="lwr_lt">1:14</a>; <a href="joh16.htm#28">16:28</a>).</ul><dt>
Let's turn again to the opening text:</dl><dt>
<b><i>1:1. In the beginning was the Word, </i></b></dt><dl>
<dt>the Word- GK= Logos<dd>[This word is similar in meaning to the Aramaic &quot;Memra,&quot; used in the Targumim, to refer to God. The Targumim (the plural form of a single 'Targum') were Aramaic translations, paraphrases and explanations of passages in the Hebrew Bible.]<dd>The GK word means...<ol type="1">
<li>a thought or concept,<li> the expression or utterance of that thought.</ol><dd>Logos is a fitting designation for Christ because:<ol type="1"><li>in Him are embodied all the treasures of the divine wisdom, the collective &quot;thought&quot; of God.<dd><a href="1cor1.htm#24">1Cor 1:24</a>; <a href="eph3.htm#11">Eph 3:11</a>; <a href="col2.htm#2">Col 2:2,3</a> (cp. <a href="pro8.htm#22">Prov 8:22-36</a>).</dd><li>He is, from eternity, but especially in His incarnation, the utterance or expression of the Person, and &quot;thought&quot; of Deity.</dd><dd>cp. <a href="joh1.htm#3" target="lwr_lt">John 1:3-5,9,14-18</a>; <a href="joh14.htm#9">14:9-11</a>; <a href="col2.htm#9">Col 2:9</a>.</dd><dt>In the Being, Person, and work of Christ, Deity is told out.<br>[Above note adapted from the ScofRB.]</ol>
<dt>in the beginning 'was'...- This verb is in the durative GK &quot;imperfect&quot; tense.<dd>The sense is that at whatever point you choose to begin, the Word already was.
<dd>cp. <a href="gen1.htm#1">Gen 1:1</a>; <a href="1joh1.htm#1">1Joh 1:1</a>; <a href="rev22.htm#13">Rev 22:13</a></dl><dt>
<b><i>and the Word was with God, </i></b></dt><dl>
<dt>with- GK= pros, indicates &quot;not mere company, but the most intimate communion.&quot; [WEVine]
<dd>This line could be translated: &quot;The Word was face to face with God.&quot; [Liberty Commentary on NT]
<dd>Implications: <ol type="a"><li> The Word is a distinct person.<li> The Word is in close fellowship with another distinct person (ie., God the Father).<li>Yet, both persons are equals...</ol></dl><dt>
<b><i>and the Word was God.</i></b></dt><dl>
<dt>Some of the cults (eg., Jehovah's Witnesses), which deny the deity of Christ, 
<dd>render this &quot;the Word was 'a' god.&quot; They point to the lack of a definite article in the GK. 
<dd>However, note the following points to the contrary...-<ol><li>In GK, no article is needed where a definite predicate nominative preceeds a verb.<li>The GK word order here is &quot;God was the Word.&quot;<br>This is, in fact, an emphatic statement of His deity.<li>Other passages also lack a definite article before &quot;God,&quot; yet obviously refer to THE God (eg., <a href="joh1.htm#6" target="lwr_lt">Joh 1:6,12,13</a>). In <a href="joh13.htm#3">Joh 13:3</a> the first occurrence of the word &quot;God&quot; lacks an article.<li>Some passages include the definite article with obvious reference to Christ (cp. <a href="mat1.htm#23">Mat 1:23</a>).</ol>
<dt>The witness of Scripture requires the deity of Christ. Examples:<ul><li>If the Word is not &quot;the God,&quot; there is no Savior.<dd>cp. <a href="isa43.htm#11">Isa 43:11</a>; <a href="1tim4.htm#10">1Tim 4:10</a>; <a href="mat1.htm#21">Mat 1:21</a>; <a href="luk1.htm#47">Luk 1:47</a>; <a href="luk2.htm#11">2:11</a>; <a href="tit2.htm#10">Titus 2:10,13</a>; <a href="tit3.htm#4">3:4,6</a></dd><li>If the Word is not &quot;the God,&quot; there is no Creator. cp. <a href="joh1.htm#3" target="lwr_lt">v.3</a>.</ul></dl><dt>
<b><i>1:2  The same was in the beginning with God.</i></b>
<dd><a href="php2.htm#6">Php 2:6</a>; <a href="heb1.htm#8">Heb 1:8</a><dt>
<b><i>1:3  All things were made by him;<br>
and without him was not any thing made that was made.</i></b>
<dd><a href="eph3.htm#9">Eph 3:9</a>; <a href="heb1.htm#1">Heb 1:1,2,10</a>; <a href="heb3.htm#4">3:4</a><dt><dt>
<b><i>1:4  In him was life; and the life was the light of men.</i></b></dt><dl>
<dt>life- GK= zoe. Only God has life in Himself. Men receive life from Him.
<dd><a href="joh5.htm#26">Joh 5:26</a>; <a href="joh17.htm#3">17:3</a>; <a href="1joh1.htm#1">1Joh 1:1,2</a>
<dt>light- GK= phos. Men have neither life nor light in themselves.<dd>Apart from an external source of light (eg., the sun), men are in physical darkness.<dd>Men are in spiritual darkness (<a href="joh3.htm#19">Joh 3:19</a>), because they are spiritually dead (<a href="eph2.htm#1">Eph 2:1,2</a>).<dd>Spiritual darkness can be broken only by spiritual life. (<a href="psa36.htm#9">Psa 36:9</a>)<br>This is the reason Christ came into our sin darkened world: cp. <a href="isa42.htm#6">Isa 42:6,7</a>; <a href="luk1.htm#78">Luk 1:78,79</a>; <a href="luk2.htm#32">2:32</a></dl><dt>
<b><i>1:5. And the light shineth in darkness;<br>
and the darkness comprehended it not.</i></b></dt><dl>
<dt>shineth- (present tense)- the One, who was the light, continues to shine.
<dt>comprehended- GK= katalambano, to take down, to take in.
<dd>The light shines, but men are blind to it (<a href="2cor4.htm#4">2Cor 4:4</a>).<dt>
<dd>Those men, who do see, point others to Christ (<a href="2cor4.htm#5">2Cor 4:5,6</a>).<br>Several such men bear testimony to Him in ch. 1. We are now introduced to the first:</dl><dt>
<b><i>1:6  There was a man sent from God, whose name [was] John.</i></b>
<dd>John-  refers to John the Baptist<br>(not to be confused with John, the disciple of Jesus, and author of this book).<dt>
<b><i>1:7 The same came for a witness, to bear witness of the Light,<br>
that all [men] through him might believe.<br>
1:8  He was not that Light, </i></b>{cp. <a href="joh1.htm#19" target="lwr_lt">v.19,20</a>}<b><i><br>but [was sent] to bear witness of that Light.</i></b> {<a href="isa49.htm#6">Isa 49:6</a>; <a href="joh3.htm#28">Joh 3:28</a>; <a href="act19.htm#4">Acts 19:4</a>}<br>
<b><i>1:9  [That] was the true Light,<br>
which lighteth every man that cometh into the world.</i></b> {cp. <a href="joh12.htm#46">Joh 12:46</a>; <a href="rom10.htm#17">Rom 10:17,18</a>}<dt><dt>
<b><i>1:10 He was in the world, and the world was made by him,<br>and the world knew him not.</i></b></dt><dl>
<dt>world- GK= kosmos, the earth, the inhabitants of the earth (mankind, human order and affairs). 
<dt>knew- GK= ginosko, to know, recognize, acknowledge.
<dd>Christ came to earth &amp; became a man. But the Creator was not recognized by His creatures. cp. <a href="act13.htm#27">Acts 13:27</a>; <a href="1cor2.htm#8">1Cor 2:8</a></dl><dt>
<b><i>1:11 He came unto his own</i></b> {things}<b><i>,<br>and his own</i></b> {people} <b><i>received him not.</i></b>
<dd>(The {enclosed} words above are implied by the GK gender.)
<dd>His own people- first the Jewish people, then all men rejected Him. cp. <a href="isa53.htm#3">Isa 53:3</a>; <a href="luk19.htm#14">Luk 19:14</a><dt>
<b><i>1:12  But as many as received him,<br>
to them gave he power to become the sons</i></b> {GK= teknon, born ones, children} <b><i>of God,<br>
[even] to them that believe on his name:</i></b></dt><dl>
<dt>receive- ie., to take, claim, accept as one's own.
<dt>power- ie., the right, or authority.
<dt>believe on- ie., to place trust in, commit oneself to.
<dd>In the context of trusting God, the word believe is usually linked with a preposition (eg., believe in, on, into, upon...).<br>I may believe a chair can hold my weight. But I will find no rest until I believe<i> on </i>the chair, committing my entire weight to it.<br>So, to become a child of God, I must entrust myself to the Person and work of Christ.<br>Note that <a href="joh1.htm#9" target="lwr_lt">v.9</a> applies to all men, but <a href="joh1.htm#12" target="lwr_lt">v.12</a> applies only to those individuals, who place their trust in Him.
<dt>his name- represents all that He is and all that He has done. cp. <a href="heb1.htm#4">Heb 1:4</a>; <a href="act3.htm#6">Acts 3:6</a></dl><dt>
<b><i>1:13 Which were born,<br>not of blood</i></b> {lit., bloods}<b><i>,  nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man,<br>but of God.</i></b></dt><dl>
<dt>Men become God's children-<ul>
<li>not by natural birth ('bloods' suggests the mingling of paternal &amp; maternal lines),<dd>
cp. <a href="joh3.htm#6">3:6</a>; also <a href="lev17.htm#11">Lev 17:11</a>.</dd>
<li>not by personal determination or effort (will of flesh), cp. <a href="tit3.htm#5">Titus 3:5</a>
<li>not by another's human intervention, eg., priestly action (will of man), cp. <a href="psa49.htm#7">Psa 49:7</a>
<li>but by God's supernatural provision, received by faith in Jesus Christ (cp. <a href="joh3.htm#3">3:3,5</a>; <a href="gal3.htm#26">Gal 3:26</a>; <a href="jam1.htm#18">Jam 1:18</a>).</ul>
<dd>It is to this end that...</dl><dt>
<b><i>1:14  And the Word was made flesh, </i></b>
<dd>was made- lit., &quot;became...&quot;- He voluntarily became human. cp. <a href="mic5.htm#2">Mic 5:2</a>; <a href="php2.htm#6">Php 2:6,7</a>; <a href="1tim3.htm#16">1Tim 3:16</a><dt>
<b><i>and dwelt among us, </i></b>
<dd>dwelt- lit., tabernacled, tented (a temporary dwelling)- cp. <a href="2cor5.htm#1">2Cor 5:1</a>; <a href="ex40.htm#34">Ex 40:34</a>)<dt>
<b><i>(and we beheld his glory,<br>
the glory as of the only begotten of</i></b> {from} <b><i>the Father,) full of grace and truth.</i></b></dt><dl>
<dt>only begotten- GK= monogenes, unique, one of a kind.
<dd>(cp. word use in <a href="heb11.htm#17">Heb 11:17</a> - Isaac was unique in that he was the one and only son of promise.)
<dd>The Word, who became flesh, (Jesus Christ) is unique. There is no other man who is God. 
<dt>glory- ie., greatness, majesty.
<dd>As God, the Word has always possessed the glory of God. cp. <a href="isa40.htm#5">Isa 40:5</a>; <a href="heb1.htm#3">Heb 1:3</a>.
<dd>As the Son, His glory was revealed to men (eg., <a href="2pet1.htm#17">2Pet 1:17</a>) and overflowed in their behalf.
<dt>full of grace &amp; truth- Jesus is the fullness of God in human flesh. <dd>cp. <a href="joh1.htm#16" target="lwr_lt">v. 16,17</a>; <a href="psa45.htm#2">Psa 45:2</a>; <a href="col1.htm#19">Col 1:19</a>; <a href="col2.htm#9">2:9</a></dl><dt>
<b><i>1:15 John bare witness of him, and cried, saying,<br>This was he of whom I spake,<br>He that cometh after me is preferred before me: for he was before me.</i></b>
<dd>John the Baptist (who was born a few months before Jesus) gives witness to His eternal existence &amp; glory.<dt>
<b><i>1:16 And of his fulness have all we received, and grace for</i></b> {lit., upon} <b><i>grace.</i></b>
<dd><a href="col2.htm#9">Col 2:9,10</a>; <a href="eph1.htm#6">Eph 1:6-8</a>; <a href="eph2.htm#5">2:5-10</a>; <a href="1pet1.htm#2">1Pet 1:2</a><dt>
<b><i>1:17 For the law was given by Moses,<br>[but] grace and truth came by Jesus Christ.</i></b></dt><dl>
<dt>the law- Reveals God's righteous standard and man's sinful condition.
<dd>- - It demands righteousness which man cannot fulfill. <a href="gal3.htm#19">Gal 3:19-24</a>
<dd>- - It condemns us, and brings us under the wrath of God. <a href="rom3.htm#19">Rom 3:19,20</a>
<dt>grace- undeserved favor, mercy. 
<dd>- - In loving kindness, God Himself provided for our need. cp. <a href="psa85.htm#4">Psa 85:4-13</a>
<dt>truth- Christ fulfilled the law's demands,<dd>both by His righteousness and by His sacrifice. <a href="rom8.htm#3">Rom 8:3,4</a>; <a href="rom3.htm#21">Rom 3:21-26</a></dl><dt>
<b><i>1:18  No man hath seen God at any time;</i></b><dd>{cp. <a href="joh4.htm#23">Joh 4:23,24</a>; <a href="joh5.htm#37">5:37</a>; <a href="joh6.htm#46">6:46</a>}<b><i><dt>
the only begotten Son, which is in the bosom of the Father,<br>
he hath declared [him].</i></b></dt><dl>
<dt>the Son...<i> is </i>in the bosom of the Father- Stated in the present tense, <dd>this stresses the continual intimacy of the Father &amp; the Son. cp. <a href="joh1.htm#1" target="lwr_lt">v. 1</a>.
<dt>declared -GK= exegeomai (the root of the English 'exegete'), to bring out, to unfold.
<dd>The Son reveals the Father to man. cp. <a href="mat11.htm#27">Mat 11:27</a>; <a href="joh14.htm#8">Joh 14:8,9</a>; <a href="joh17.htm#25">17:25,26</a>
