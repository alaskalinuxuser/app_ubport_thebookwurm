Job  10<br>1. My soul is weary of my life; I will leave my complaint upon myself; I will speak in the bitterness of my soul.<br><a name="2">2</a>  I will say unto God, Do not condemn me; shew me wherefore thou contendest with me.<br><a name="3">3</a>  [Is it] good unto thee that thou shouldest oppress, that thou shouldest despise the work of thine hands, and shine upon the counsel of the wicked?<br><a name="4">4</a>  Hast thou eyes of flesh? or seest thou as man seeth?<br><a name="5">5</a>  [Are] thy days as the days of man? [are] thy years as man's days,<br><a name="6">6</a>  That thou enquirest after mine iniquity, and searchest after my sin?<br><a name="7">7</a>  Thou knowest that I am not wicked; and [there is] none that can deliver out of thine hand.<br><a name="8">8</a>. Thine hands have made me and fashioned me together round about; yet thou dost destroy me.<br><a name="9">9</a>  Remember, I beseech thee, that thou hast made me as the clay; and wilt thou bring me into dust again?<br><a name="10">10</a>  Hast thou not poured me out as milk, and curdled me like cheese?<br><a name="11">11</a>  Thou hast clothed me with skin and flesh, and hast fenced me with bones and sinews.<br><a name="12">12</a>  Thou hast granted me life and favour, and thy visitation hath preserved my spirit.<br><a name="13">13</a>  And these [things] hast thou hid in thine heart: I know that this [is] with thee.<br><a name="14">14</a>. If I sin, then thou markest me, and thou wilt not acquit me from mine iniquity.<br><a name="15">15</a>  If I be wicked, woe unto me; and [if] I be righteous, [yet] will I not lift up my head. [I am] full of confusion; therefore see thou mine affliction;<br><a name="16">16</a>  For it increaseth. Thou huntest me as a fierce lion: and again thou shewest thyself marvellous upon me.<br><a name="17">17</a>  Thou renewest thy witnesses against me, and increasest thine indignation upon me; changes and war [are] against me.<br><a name="18">18</a>  Wherefore then hast thou brought me forth out of the womb? Oh that I had given up the ghost, and no eye had seen me!<br><a name="19">19</a>  I should have been as though I had not been; I should have been carried from the womb to the grave.<br><a name="20">20</a>  [Are] not my days few? cease [then, and] let me alone, that I may take comfort a little,<br><a name="21">21</a>  Before I go [whence] I shall not return, [even] to the land of darkness and the shadow of death;<br><a name="22">22</a>  A land of darkness, as darkness [itself; and] of the shadow of death, without any order, and [where] the light [is] as darkness.<br><br>Go to <a href="job11.htm#1">Job 11</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
