Psalms  69<br> 1. To the chief Musician upon Shoshannim, [A Psalm] of David. Save me, O God; for the waters are come in unto [my] soul.<br><a name="2">2</a>  I sink in deep mire, where [there is] no standing: I am come into deep waters, where the floods overflow me.<br><a name="3">3</a>  I am weary of my crying: my throat is dried: mine eyes fail while I wait for my God.<br><a name="4">4</a>  They that hate me without a cause are more than the hairs of mine head: they that would destroy me, [being] mine enemies wrongfully, are mighty: then I restored [that] which I took not away.<br><a name="5">5</a>  O God, thou knowest my foolishness; and my sins are not hid from thee.<br><a name="6">6</a>  Let not them that wait on thee, O Lord GOD of hosts, be ashamed for my sake: let not those that seek thee be confounded for my sake, O God of Israel.<br><a name="7">7</a>  Because for thy sake I have borne reproach; shame hath covered my face.<br><a name="8">8</a>  I am become a stranger unto my brethren, and an alien unto my mother's children.<br><a name="9">9</a>  For the zeal of thine house hath eaten me up; and the reproaches of them that reproached thee are fallen upon me.<br><a name="10">10</a>  When I wept, [and chastened] my soul with fasting, that was to my reproach.<br><a name="11">11</a>  I made sackcloth also my garment; and I became a proverb to them.<br><a name="12">12</a>  They that sit in the gate speak against me; and I [was] the song of the drunkards.<br><a name="13">13</a>. But as for me, my prayer [is] unto thee, O LORD, [in] an acceptable time: O God, in the multitude of thy mercy hear me, in the truth of thy salvation.<br><a name="14">14</a>  Deliver me out of the mire, and let me not sink: let me be delivered from them that hate me, and out of the deep waters.<br><a name="15">15</a>  Let not the waterflood overflow me, neither let the deep swallow me up, and let not the pit shut her mouth upon me.<br><a name="16">16</a>  Hear me, O LORD; for thy lovingkindness [is] good: turn unto me according to the multitude of thy tender mercies.<br><a name="17">17</a>  And hide not thy face from thy servant; for I am in trouble: hear me speedily.<br><a name="18">18</a>  Draw nigh unto my soul, [and] redeem it: deliver me because of mine enemies.<br><a name="19">19</a>  Thou hast known my reproach, and my shame, and my dishonour: mine adversaries [are] all before thee.<br><a name="20">20</a>  Reproach hath broken my heart; and I am full of heaviness: and I looked [for some] to take pity, but [there was] none; and for comforters, but I found none.<br><a name="21">21</a>  They gave me also gall for my meat; and in my thirst they gave me vinegar to drink.<br><a name="22">22</a>. Let their table become a snare before them: and [that which should have been] for [their] welfare, [let it become] a trap.<br><a name="23">23</a>  Let their eyes be darkened, that they see not; and make their loins continually to shake.<br><a name="24">24</a>  Pour out thine indignation upon them, and let thy wrathful anger take hold of them.<br><a name="25">25</a>  Let their habitation be desolate; [and] let none dwell in their tents.<br><a name="26">26</a>  For they persecute [him] whom thou hast smitten; and they talk to the grief of those whom thou hast wounded.<br><a name="27">27</a>  Add iniquity unto their iniquity: and let them not come into thy righteousness.<br><a name="28">28</a>  Let them be blotted out of the book of the living, and not be written with the righteous.<br><a name="29">29</a>  But I [am] poor and sorrowful: let thy salvation, O God, set me up on high.<br><a name="30">30</a>. I will praise the name of God with a song, and will magnify him with thanksgiving.<br><a name="31">31</a>  [This] also shall please the LORD better than an ox [or] bullock that hath horns and hoofs.<br><a name="32">32</a>  The humble shall see [this, and] be glad: and your heart shall live that seek God.<br><a name="33">33</a>  For the LORD heareth the poor, and despiseth not his prisoners.<br><a name="34">34</a>  Let the heaven and earth praise him, the seas, and every thing that moveth therein.<br><a name="35">35</a>  For God will save Zion, and will build the cities of Judah: that they may dwell there, and have it in possession.<br><a name="36">36</a>  The seed also of his servants shall inherit it: and they that love his name shall dwell therein.<br><br>Go to <a href="psa70.htm#1">Psalm 70</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
