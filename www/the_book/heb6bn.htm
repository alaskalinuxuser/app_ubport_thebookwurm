<b><a href="heb6.htm#13" target="lwr_lt">Hebrews 6:13-20</a> - <a href="heb_menu.htm" target="lwr_lt">Outline of Hebrews </b>(MENU page)</a><br>
<dl>
<dt>In <a href="heb6.htm#13" target="lwr_lt">vs.13-20</a>, there are two interwoven themes:</dt><dl>
<dt>1. Abraham is an example of &quot;faith &amp; patience.&quot; (cp. <a href="heb6.htm#11" target="lwr_lt">vs. 11-12</a>)
<dt>2. Salvation is secure to true believers, since it is:
<dd>A. Based upon God's Promise (vs. 13-15).
<dd>B. Secured by God's Oath  (vs. 16-18).
<dd>C. Anchored by our High Priest (vs. 19-20).
<dt>(Any lingering doubt about the security of salvation is dismissed. cp. <a href="heb6.htm#4" target="lwr_lt">vs.4-6,9</a>.)</dl>
<dt><b><i>6:13 For when God made promise to Abraham,<br>
because he could swear by no greater, he sware by himself,<br>
6:14 Saying, Surely blessing I will bless thee,<br>
and multiplying I will multiply thee.</i></b>
<dd>This is a quotation from <a href="gen22.htm#15">Gen 22:15-18</a>.
<dd>I will...I will...- God Himself brings His promises to fruition.
<dt><dt>
<b><i>6:15 And so, after he had patiently endured, he obtained the promise.</i></b></dt><dl>
<dt>so- GK=houto, in this manner, thus.
<dt>obtained- (cp. this word in <a href="rom11.htm#6">Rom 11:6,7</a>) Abraham 'obtained' not by works, but by grace.
<dd>ie., Because God Himself brings His promises to completion, Abraham received that which God had promised, through patient trust in God's promise. (eg., Isaac, <a href="gen21.htm#5">Gen 21:5</a>)
<dt>Was Abraham ever in danger of losing the promise?
<dd>No, it was secured by God Himself.
<dt>Was Abraham apathetic because the promise was secure?
<dd>No, he is an example to us of diligent, not slothful, faith &amp; patience (<a href="heb6.htm#11" target="lwr_lt">vs.11,12</a>).
<dt>patiently endured- GK= makrothumeo (cp. v.12), longsuffering.
<dd>(makro= large, long, great;  thumos= passion, heat) 
<dt>Thus, Abraham's desire for the fulfillment of God's promise was:<ul>
<li>Intense - the consuming passion of his life,
<dd>- the constant focus of his thoughts,</dd>
<dd>- the context of his growing knowledge of God.</dd>
<dd><a href="gen12.htm#1">Gen 12:1-4</a>; <a href="gen15.htm#2">15:2-6</a>; <a href="gen16.htm#2">16:2</a>; <a href="gen17.htm#15">17:15-19</a>; <a href="gen22.htm#1">22:1-3,11-14</a>;  <a href="gen24.htm#7">24:7</a></dd>
<li>Continuing - uncrushed by the many apparent obstacles to fulfillment. <a href="rom4.htm#16">Rom 4:16-25</a></ul>
<dt>Abraham's hope (ie., confident expectation) was in God Himself.</dl>
<dt><b><i>6:16 For men verily swear by the greater:<br>
and an oath for confirmation [is] to them an end of all strife.</i></b></dt><dl>
<dt>oath- GK=horkos, root word means 'fence,' hence a setting of limits.
<dt>confirmation- GK=bebaiosis, that which establishes or secures a matter.
<dt>An oath, sworn before God between men, looks to God as the mediator to hold the parties within the bounds of their contract.
<dd>(Consider the finality and inviolability of Israel's oath to the Gibeonites, <a href="josh9.htm#15">Josh 9:15-20</a>; <a href="2sam21.htm#1">2Sam 21:1-3</a>)</dl>
<dt><b><i>6:17 Wherein </i></b>{ie., likewise} <b><i>God, willing more abundantly to shew unto the heirs of promise<br>
the immutability of his counsel, confirmed [it] by an oath:</i></b></dt><dl>
<dt>immutability- unchangeableness
<dt>counsel- GK=boule, purpose, determined will:
<dd>God's Word (promise) is not subject to change.
<dd>cp. <a href="num23.htm#19">Num 23:19</a>;  <a href="mal3.htm#6">Mal 3:6</a>;  <a href="jam1.htm#17">Jam 1:17</a>
<dt>more abundantly- ie., much more than is necessary.
<dt>confirmed- GK=mesiteuo, to give surety, to mediate, to interpose.
<dd>God has made His sure Word exceedingly sure, by interposing Himself as its Guarantor.  He has done so for the benefit of those who are...
<dt>heirs of promise- by faith, like that of Abraham. (<a href="rom4.htm#16">Rom 4:16</a>)
<dd>Evidently, He wants us to know that we have eternal life.  <a href="1joh5.htm#9">1Joh 5:9-13</a></dl>
<dt><b><i>6:18 That by two immutable things, in which [it was] impossible for God to lie,<br>
we might have a strong consolation,<br>
who have fled for refuge to lay hold upon the hope set before us:</i></b></dt><dl>
<dt>we- the heirs of promise (v.17)- (in contrast to those who are dull of hearing, and who turn away)...
<dt>have fled for refuge- GK=katapheugo, an intense form of pheugo (from which the Eng. 'fugitive').<dd>Those who<i> flee</i> are moved with desperation and urgency. <a href="mat3.htm#7">Mat 3:7</a>;  <a href="1the1.htm#10">1The 1:10</a>
<dt>to lay hold upon- GK=krateo, to be strong, to apprehend...
<dd>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ie. with strength of faith, cp. <a href="heb6.htm#15" target="lwr_lt">v.15</a>)</dd><dl>
<dt>the hope (GK=elpis, confident expectation)-
<dd>of eternal life, in Christ the Savior whom God has set before us.
<dd><a href="1tim1.htm#1">1Tim 1:1</a>; <a href="rom3.htm#25">Rom 3:25-26</a>; <a href="php3.htm#7">Php 3:7-9</a>; <a href="heb5.htm#9">Heb 5:9</a>
<dd>Those, who turn away from Christ (<a href="heb6.htm#6" target="lwr_lt">v.6</a>), comprehend neither the severity of God's wrath, nor the security of His salvation.</dl>
<dt>have...consolation- GK=paraklesis, comfort, solace, cp. <a href="2cor1.htm#5">2Cor 1:5-7</a>; <a href="2the2.htm#16">2The 2:16,17</a>
<dd>What comfort can there be for those who flee from wrath, except to be free from wrath?
<dd>We may take comfort that our salvation will not fail, since it rests upon --
<dt>two immutable things-
<dd>(1) God's Promise- established by the authority of His Word. cp. <a href="gen15.htm#4">Gen 15:4-6</a>
<dd>(2) God's Oath- established by the integrity of His Person (He sware by Himself). cp. <a href="gen22.htm#16">Gen 22:16-18</a></dl>
<dt><b><i>6:19 Which [hope] we have as an anchor of the soul, both sure and stedfast,</i></b></dt><dl>
<dt>We who entrust our salvation to Jesus Christ are safe &amp; secure.
<dt>For He is as certain as God's (1) Word and (2) Oath:
<dd>(1) Of Him, &quot;The Lord<i> hath said</i>... 'Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee.'&quot; (<a href="heb5.htm#5">5:5</a>)
<dd>(2) Of Him, &quot;The Lord<i> hath sworn </i>and will not repent,
<dd>'Thou art a priest forever after the order of Melchizedek.'&quot; (<a href="heb5.htm#6">5:6</a>; <a href="heb7.htm#21">7:21</a>)
<dt>By Him, our storm tossed lives are anchored to the very Rock of Heaven.
<dd>To Him, we are connected by an unbreakable line. (<a href="rom8.htm#35">Rom 8:35-39</a>)...</dl><dt>
<b><i>and which entereth into that within the veil;</i></b><br>
<b><i>6:20 Whither the forerunner is for us entered,<br>
[even] Jesus, made an high priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec.</i></b></dt><dl>
<dt>Our Lord Jesus has gone before us into Heaven itself (not a mere earthly Temple, <a href="heb8.htm#1">8:1,2</a>)-
<dd>-- where He, as our High Priest, is our eternal surety. <a href="heb7.htm#22">Heb 7:22</a>
<dd>-- from where He will come again to receive us unto Himself. <a href="joh14.htm#1">Joh 14:1-3</a></dl></dl><br>
