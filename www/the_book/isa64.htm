Isaiah  64<br>1. Oh that thou wouldest rend the heavens, that thou wouldest come down, that the mountains might flow down at thy presence,<br><a name="2">2</a>  As [when] the melting fire burneth, the fire causeth the waters to boil, to make thy name known to thine adversaries, [that] the nations may tremble at thy presence!<br><a name="3">3</a>  When thou didst terrible things [which] we looked not for, thou camest down, the mountains flowed down at thy presence.<br><a name="4">4</a>  For since the beginning of the world [men] have not heard, nor perceived by the ear, neither hath the eye seen, O God, beside thee, [what] he hath prepared for him that waiteth for him.<br><a name="5">5</a>  Thou meetest him that rejoiceth and worketh righteousness, [those that] remember thee in thy ways: behold, thou art wroth; for we have sinned: in those is continuance, and we shall be saved.<br><a name="6">6</a>. But we are all as an unclean [thing], and all our righteousnesses [are] as filthy rags; and we all do fade as a leaf; and our iniquities, like the wind, have taken us away.<br><a name="7">7</a>  And [there is] none that calleth upon thy name, that stirreth up himself to take hold of thee: for thou hast hid thy face from us, and hast consumed us, because of our iniquities.<br><a name="8">8</a>  But now, O LORD, thou [art] our father; we [are] the clay, and thou our potter; and we all [are] the work of thy hand.<br><a name="9">9</a>  Be not wroth very sore, O LORD, neither remember iniquity for ever: behold, see, we beseech thee, we [are] all thy people.<br><a name="10">10</a>  Thy holy cities are a wilderness, Zion is a wilderness, Jerusalem a desolation.<br><a name="11">11</a>  Our holy and our beautiful house, where our fathers praised thee, is burned up with fire: and all our pleasant things are laid waste.<br><a name="12">12</a>  Wilt thou refrain thyself for these [things], O LORD? wilt thou hold thy peace, and afflict us very sore?<br><br>Go to <a href="isa65.htm#1">Isaiah 65</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
