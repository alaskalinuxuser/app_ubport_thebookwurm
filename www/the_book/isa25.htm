Isaiah  25<br>1. O LORD, thou [art] my God; I will exalt thee, I will praise thy name; for thou hast done wonderful [things; thy] counsels of old [are] faithfulness [and] truth.<br><a name="2">2</a>  For thou hast made of a city an heap; [of] a defenced city a ruin: a palace of strangers to be no city; it shall never be built.<br><a name="3">3</a>  Therefore shall the strong people glorify thee, the city of the terrible nations shall fear thee.<br><a name="4">4</a>  For thou hast been a strength to the poor, a strength to the needy in his distress, a refuge from the storm, a shadow from the heat, when the blast of the terrible ones [is] as a storm [against] the wall.<br><a name="5">5</a>  Thou shalt bring down the noise of strangers, as the heat in a dry place; [even] the heat with the shadow of a cloud: the branch of the terrible ones shall be brought low.<br><a name="6">6</a>. And in this mountain shall the LORD of hosts make unto all people a feast of fat things, a feast of wines on the lees, of fat things full of marrow, of wines on the lees well refined.<br><a name="7">7</a>  And he will destroy in this mountain the face of the covering cast over all people, and the vail that is spread over all nations.<br><a name="8">8</a>  He will swallow up death in victory; and the Lord GOD will wipe away tears from off all faces; and the rebuke of his people shall he take away from off all the earth: for the LORD hath spoken [it].<br><a name="9">9</a>. And it shall be said in that day, Lo, this [is] our God; we have waited for him, and he will save us: this [is] the LORD; we have waited for him, we will be glad and rejoice in his salvation.<br><a name="10">10</a>  For in this mountain shall the hand of the LORD rest, and Moab shall be trodden down under him, even as straw is trodden down for the dunghill.<br><a name="11">11</a>  And he shall spread forth his hands in the midst of them, as he that swimmeth spreadeth forth [his hands] to swim: and he shall bring down their pride together with the spoils of their hands.<br><a name="12">12</a>  And the fortress of the high fort of thy walls shall he bring down, lay low, [and] bring to the ground, [even] to the dust.<br><br>Go to <a href="isa26.htm#1">Isaiah 26</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
