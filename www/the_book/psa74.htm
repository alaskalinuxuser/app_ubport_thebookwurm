Psalms  74<br>1. Maschil of Asaph. O God, why hast thou cast [us] off for ever? [why] doth thine anger smoke against the sheep of thy pasture?<br><a name="2">2</a>  Remember thy congregation, [which] thou hast purchased of old; the rod of thine inheritance, [which] thou hast redeemed; this mount Zion, wherein thou hast dwelt.<br><a name="3">3</a>  Lift up thy feet unto the perpetual desolations; [even] all [that] the enemy hath done wickedly in the sanctuary.<br><a name="4">4</a>  Thine enemies roar in the midst of thy congregations; they set up their ensigns [for] signs.<br><a name="5">5</a>  [A man] was famous according as he had lifted up axes upon the thick trees.<br><a name="6">6</a>  But now they break down the carved work thereof at once with axes and hammers.<br><a name="7">7</a>  They have cast fire into thy sanctuary, they have defiled [by casting down] the dwelling place of thy name to the ground.<br><a name="8">8</a>  They said in their hearts, Let us destroy them together: they have burned up all the synagogues of God in the land.<br><a name="9">9</a>  We see not our signs: [there is] no more any prophet: neither [is there] among us any that knoweth how long.<br><a name="10">10</a>  O God, how long shall the adversary reproach? shall the enemy blaspheme thy name for ever?<br><a name="11">11</a>  Why withdrawest thou thy hand, even thy right hand? pluck [it] out of thy bosom.<br><a name="12">12</a>. For God [is] my King of old, working salvation in the midst of the earth.<br><a name="13">13</a>  Thou didst divide the sea by thy strength: thou brakest the heads of the dragons in the waters.<br><a name="14">14</a>  Thou brakest the heads of leviathan in pieces, [and] gavest him [to be] meat to the people inhabiting the wilderness.<br><a name="15">15</a>  Thou didst cleave the fountain and the flood: thou driedst up mighty rivers.<br><a name="16">16</a>  The day [is] thine, the night also [is] thine: thou hast prepared the light and the sun.<br><a name="17">17</a>  Thou hast set all the borders of the earth: thou hast made summer and winter.<br><a name="18">18</a>. Remember this, [that] the enemy hath reproached, O LORD, and [that] the foolish people have blasphemed thy name.<br><a name="19">19</a>  O deliver not the soul of thy turtledove unto the multitude [of the wicked]: forget not the congregation of thy poor for ever.<br><a name="20">20</a>  Have respect unto the covenant: for the dark places of the earth are full of the habitations of cruelty.<br><a name="21">21</a>  O let not the oppressed return ashamed: let the poor and needy praise thy name.<br><a name="22">22</a>  Arise, O God, plead thine own cause: remember how the foolish man reproacheth thee daily.<br><a name="23">23</a>  Forget not the voice of thine enemies: the tumult of those that rise up against thee increaseth continually.<br><br>Go to <a href="psa75.htm#1">Psalm 75</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
