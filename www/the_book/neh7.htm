Nehemiah   7<br>1. Now it came to pass, when the wall was built, and I had set up the doors, and the porters and the singers and the Levites were appointed,<br><a name="2">2</a>  That I gave my brother Hanani, and Hananiah the ruler of the palace, charge over Jerusalem: for he [was] a faithful man, and feared God above many.<br><a name="3">3</a>  And I said unto them, Let not the gates of Jerusalem be opened until the sun be hot; and while they stand by, let them shut the doors, and bar [them]: and appoint watches of the inhabitants of Jerusalem, every one in his watch, and every one [to be] over against his house.<br><a name="4">4</a>  Now the city [was] large and great: but the people [were] few therein, and the houses [were] not builded.<br><a name="5">5</a>.
