Revelation  16<br> 1. And I heard a great voice out of the temple saying to the seven angels, Go your ways, and pour out the vials of the wrath of God upon the earth.<br><a name="2">2</a>  And the first went, and poured out his vial upon the earth; and there fell a noisome and grievous sore upon the men which had the mark of the beast, and [upon] them which worshipped his image.<br><a name="3">3</a>  And the second angel poured out his vial upon the sea; and it became as the blood of a dead [man]: and every living soul died in the sea.<br><a name="4">4</a>  And the third angel poured out his vial upon the rivers and fountains of waters; and they became blood.<br><a name="5">5</a>  And I heard the angel of the waters say, Thou art righteous, O Lord, which art, and wast, and shalt be, because thou hast judged thus.<br><a name="6">6</a>  For they have shed the blood of saints and prophets, and thou hast given them blood to drink; for they are worthy.<br><a name="7">7</a>  And I heard another out of the altar say, Even so, Lord God Almighty, true and righteous [are] thy judgments.<br><a name="8">8</a>. And the fourth angel poured out his vial upon the sun; and power was given unto him to scorch men with fire.<br><a name="9">9</a>  And men were scorched with great heat, and blasphemed the name of God, which hath power over these plagues: and they repented not to give him glory.<br><a name="10">10</a>  And the fifth angel poured out his vial upon the seat of the beast; and his kingdom was full of darkness; and they gnawed their tongues for pain,<br><a name="11">11</a>  And blasphemed the God of heaven because of their pains and their sores, and repented not of their deeds.<br><a name="12">12</a>. And the sixth angel poured out his vial upon the great river Euphrates; and the water thereof was dried up, that the way of the kings of the east might be prepared.<br><a name="13">13</a>  And I saw three unclean spirits like frogs [come] out of the mouth of the dragon, and out of the mouth of the beast, and out of the mouth of the false prophet.<br><a name="14">14</a>  For they are the spirits of devils, working miracles, [which] go forth unto the kings of the earth and of the whole world, to gather them to the battle of that great day of God Almighty.<br><a name="15">15</a>  Behold, I come as a thief. Blessed [is] he that watcheth, and keepeth his garments, lest he walk naked, and they see his shame.<br><a name="16">16</a>  And he gathered them together into a place called in the Hebrew tongue Armageddon.<br><a name="17">17</a>. And the seventh angel poured out his vial into the air; and there came a great voice out of the temple of heaven, from the throne, saying, It is done.<br><a name="18">18</a>  And there were voices, and thunders, and lightnings; and there was a great earthquake, such as was not since men were upon the earth, so mighty an earthquake, [and] so great.<br><a name="19">19</a>  And the great city was divided into three parts, and the cities of the nations fell: and great Babylon came in remembrance before God, to give unto her the cup of the wine of the fierceness of his wrath.<br><a name="20">20</a>  And every island fled away, and the mountains were not found.<br><a name="21">21</a>  And there fell upon men a great hail out of heaven, [every stone] about the weight of a talent: and men blasphemed God because of the plague of the hail; for the plague thereof was exceeding great.<br><br>Go to <a href="rev17.htm#1">Revelation 17</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
