Job  37<br>1. At this also my heart trembleth, and is moved out of his place.<br><a name="2">2</a>  Hear attentively the noise of his voice, and the sound [that] goeth out of his mouth.<br><a name="3">3</a>  He directeth it under the whole heaven, and his lightning unto the ends of the earth.<br><a name="4">4</a>  After it a voice roareth: he thundereth with the voice of his excellency; and he will not stay them when his voice is heard.<br><a name="5">5</a>  God thundereth marvellously with his voice; great things doeth he, which we cannot comprehend.<br><a name="6">6</a>. For he saith to the snow, Be thou [on] the earth; likewise to the small rain, and to the great rain of his strength.<br><a name="7">7</a>  He sealeth up the hand of every man; that all men may know his work.<br><a name="8">8</a>  Then the beasts go into dens, and remain in their places.<br><a name="9">9</a>  Out of the south cometh the whirlwind: and cold out of the north.<br><a name="10">10</a>  By the breath of God frost is given: and the breadth of the waters is straitened.<br><a name="11">11</a>  Also by watering he wearieth the thick cloud: he scattereth his bright cloud:<br><a name="12">12</a>  And it is turned round about by his counsels: that they may do whatsoever he commandeth them upon the face of the world in the earth.<br><a name="13">13</a>  He causeth it to come, whether for correction, or for his land, or for mercy.<br><a name="14">14</a>. Hearken unto this, O Job: stand still, and consider the wondrous works of God.<br><a name="15">15</a>  Dost thou know when God disposed them, and caused the light of his cloud to shine?<br><a name="16">16</a>  Dost thou know the balancings of the clouds, the wondrous works of him which is perfect in knowledge?<br><a name="17">17</a>  How thy garments [are] warm, when he quieteth the earth by the south [wind]?<br><a name="18">18</a>  Hast thou with him spread out the sky, [which is] strong, [and] as a molten looking glass?<br><a name="19">19</a>  Teach us what we shall say unto him; [for] we cannot order [our speech] by reason of darkness.<br><a name="20">20</a>  Shall it be told him that I speak? if a man speak, surely he shall be swallowed up.<br><a name="21">21</a>. And now [men] see not the bright light which [is] in the clouds: but the wind passeth, and cleanseth them.<br><a name="22">22</a>  Fair weather cometh out of the north: with God [is] terrible majesty.<br><a name="23">23</a>  [Touching] the Almighty, we cannot find him out: [he is] excellent in power, and in judgment, and in plenty of justice: he will not afflict.<br><a name="24">24</a>  Men do therefore fear him: he respecteth not any [that are] wise of heart.<br><br>Go to <a href="job38.htm#1">Job 38</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
