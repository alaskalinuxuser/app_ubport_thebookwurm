Job  22<br>1. Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered and said,<br><a name="2">2</a>  Can a man be profitable unto God, as he that is wise may be profitable unto himself?<br><a name="3">3</a>  [Is it] any pleasure to the Almighty, that thou art righteous? or [is it] gain [to him], that thou makest thy ways perfect?<br><a name="4">4</a>  Will he reprove thee for fear of thee? will he enter with thee into judgment?<br><a name="5">5</a>. [Is] not thy wickedness great? and thine iniquities infinite?<br><a name="6">6</a>  For thou hast taken a pledge from thy brother for nought, and stripped the naked of their clothing.<br><a name="7">7</a>  Thou hast not given water to the weary to drink, and thou hast withholden bread from the hungry.<br><a name="8">8</a>  But [as for] the mighty man, he had the earth; and the honourable man dwelt in it.<br><a name="9">9</a>  Thou hast sent widows away empty, and the arms of the fatherless have been broken.<br><a name="10">10</a>  Therefore snares [are] round about thee, and sudden fear troubleth thee;<br><a name="11">11</a>  Or darkness, [that] thou canst not see; and abundance of waters cover thee.<br><a name="12">12</a>  [Is] not God in the height of heaven? and behold the height of the stars, how high they are!<br><a name="13">13</a>  And thou sayest, How doth God know? can he judge through the dark cloud?<br><a name="14">14</a>  Thick clouds [are] a covering to him, that he seeth not; and he walketh in the circuit of heaven.<br><a name="15">15</a>. Hast thou marked the old way which wicked men have trodden?<br><a name="16">16</a>  Which were cut down out of time, whose foundation was overflown with a flood:<br><a name="17">17</a>  Which said unto God, Depart from us: and what can the Almighty do for them?<br><a name="18">18</a>  Yet he filled their houses with good [things]: but the counsel of the wicked is far from me.<br><a name="19">19</a>  The righteous see [it], and are glad: and the innocent laugh them to scorn.<br><a name="20">20</a>  Whereas our substance is not cut down, but the remnant of them the fire consumeth.<br><a name="21">21</a>. Acquaint now thyself with him, and be at peace: thereby good shall come unto thee.<br><a name="22">22</a>  Receive, I pray thee, the law from his mouth, and lay up his words in thine heart.<br><a name="23">23</a>  If thou return to the Almighty, thou shalt be built up, thou shalt put away iniquity far from thy tabernacles.<br><a name="24">24</a>  Then shalt thou lay up gold as dust, and the [gold] of Ophir as the stones of the brooks.<br><a name="25">25</a>  Yea, the Almighty shall be thy defence, and thou shalt have plenty of silver.<br><a name="26">26</a>  For then shalt thou have thy delight in the Almighty, and shalt lift up thy face unto God.<br><a name="27">27</a>  Thou shalt make thy prayer unto him, and he shall hear thee, and thou shalt pay thy vows.<br><a name="28">28</a>  Thou shalt also decree a thing, and it shall be established unto thee: and the light shall shine upon thy ways.<br><a name="29">29</a>  When [men] are cast down, then thou shalt say, [There is] lifting up; and he shall save the humble person.<br><a name="30">30</a>  He shall deliver the island of the innocent: and it is delivered by the pureness of thine hands.<br><br>Go to <a href="job23.htm#1">Job 23</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
