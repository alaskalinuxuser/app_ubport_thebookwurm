Job   9<br>1. Then Job answered and said,<br><a name="2">2</a>  I know [it is] so of a truth: but how should man be just with God?<br><a name="3">3</a>  If he will contend with him, he cannot answer him one of a thousand.<br><a name="4">4</a>  [He is] wise in heart, and mighty in strength: who hath hardened [himself] against him, and hath prospered?<br><a name="5">5</a>  Which removeth the mountains, and they know not: which overturneth them in his anger.<br><a name="6">6</a>  Which shaketh the earth out of her place, and the pillars thereof tremble.<br><a name="7">7</a>  Which commandeth the sun, and it riseth not; and sealeth up the stars.<br><a name="8">8</a>  Which alone spreadeth out the heavens, and treadeth upon the waves of the sea.<br><a name="9">9</a>  Which maketh Arcturus, Orion, and Pleiades, and the chambers of the south.<br><a name="10">10</a>  Which doeth great things past finding out; yea, and wonders without number.<br><a name="11">11</a>  Lo, he goeth by me, and I see [him] not: he passeth on also, but I perceive him not.<br><a name="12">12</a>  Behold, he taketh away, who can hinder him? who will say unto him, What doest thou?<br><a name="13">13</a>  [If] God will not withdraw his anger, the proud helpers do stoop under him.<br><a name="14">14</a>. How much less shall I answer him, [and] choose out my words [to reason] with him?<br><a name="15">15</a>  Whom, though I were righteous, [yet] would I not answer, [but] I would make supplication to my judge.<br><a name="16">16</a>  If I had called, and he had answered me; [yet] would I not believe that he had hearkened unto my voice.<br><a name="17">17</a>  For he breaketh me with a tempest, and multiplieth my wounds without cause.<br><a name="18">18</a>  He will not suffer me to take my breath, but filleth me with bitterness.<br><a name="19">19</a>  If [I speak] of strength, lo, [he is] strong: and if of judgment, who shall set me a time [to plead]?<br><a name="20">20</a>  If I justify myself, mine own mouth shall condemn me: [if I say], I [am] perfect, it shall also prove me perverse.<br><a name="21">21</a>  [Though] I [were] perfect, [yet] would I not know my soul: I would despise my life.<br><a name="22">22</a>. This [is] one [thing], therefore I said [it], He destroyeth the perfect and the wicked.<br><a name="23">23</a>  If the scourge slay suddenly, he will laugh at the trial of the innocent.<br><a name="24">24</a>  The earth is given into the hand of the wicked: he covereth the faces of the judges thereof; if not, where, [and] who [is] he?<br><a name="25">25</a>. Now my days are swifter than a post: they flee away, they see no good.<br><a name="26">26</a>  They are passed away as the swift ships: as the eagle [that] hasteth to the prey.<br><a name="27">27</a>  If I say, I will forget my complaint, I will leave off my heaviness, and comfort [myself]:<br><a name="28">28</a>  I am afraid of all my sorrows, I know that thou wilt not hold me innocent.<br><a name="29">29</a>  [If] I be wicked, why then labour I in vain?<br><a name="30">30</a>  If I wash myself with snow water, and make my hands never so clean;<br><a name="31">31</a>  Yet shalt thou plunge me in the ditch, and mine own clothes shall abhor me.<br><a name="32">32</a>  For [he is] not a man, as I [am, that] I should answer him, [and] we should come together in judgment.<br><a name="33">33</a>  Neither is there any daysman betwixt us, [that] might lay his hand upon us both.<br><a name="34">34</a>  Let him take his rod away from me, and let not his fear terrify me:<br><a name="35">35</a>  [Then] would I speak, and not fear him; but [it is] not so with me.<br><br>Go to <a href="job10.htm#1">Job 10</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
