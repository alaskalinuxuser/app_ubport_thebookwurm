Zechariah  10<br>1. Ask ye of the LORD rain in the time of the latter rain; [so] the LORD shall make bright clouds, and give them showers of rain, to every one grass in the field.<br><a name="2">2</a>  For the idols have spoken vanity, and the diviners have seen a lie, and have told false dreams; they comfort in vain: therefore they went their way as a flock, they were troubled, because [there was] no shepherd.<br><a name="3">3</a>  Mine anger was kindled against the shepherds, and I punished the goats: for the LORD of hosts hath visited his flock the house of Judah, and hath made them as his goodly horse in the battle.<br><a name="4">4</a>  Out of him came forth the corner, out of him the nail, out of him the battle bow, out of him every oppressor together.<br><a name="5">5</a>. And they shall be as mighty [men], which tread down [their enemies] in the mire of the streets in the battle: and they shall fight, because the LORD [is] with them, and the riders on horses shall be confounded.<br><a name="6">6</a>  And I will strengthen the house of Judah, and I will save the house of Joseph, and I will bring them again to place them; for I have mercy upon them: and they shall be as though I had not cast them off: for I [am] the LORD their God, and will hear them.<br><a name="7">7</a>  And [they of] Ephraim shall be like a mighty [man], and their heart shall rejoice as through wine: yea, their children shall see [it], and be glad; their heart shall rejoice in the LORD.<br><a name="8">8</a>  I will hiss for them, and gather them; for I have redeemed them: and they shall increase as they have increased.<br><a name="9">9</a>  And I will sow them among the people: and they shall remember me in far countries; and they shall live with their children, and turn again.<br><a name="10">10</a>  I will bring them again also out of the land of Egypt, and gather them out of Assyria; and I will bring them into the land of Gilead and Lebanon; and [place] shall not be found for them.<br><a name="11">11</a>  And he shall pass through the sea with affliction, and shall smite the waves in the sea, and all the deeps of the river shall dry up: and the pride of Assyria shall be brought down, and the sceptre of Egypt shall depart away.<br><a name="12">12</a>  And I will strengthen them in the LORD; and they shall walk up and down in his name, saith the LORD.<br><br>Go to <a href="zech11.htm#1">Zechariah 11</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
