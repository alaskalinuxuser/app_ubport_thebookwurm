Psalms 140<br>1. To the chief Musician, A Psalm of David. Deliver me, O LORD, from the evil man: preserve me from the violent man;<br><a name="2">2</a>  Which imagine mischiefs in [their] heart; continually are they gathered together [for] war.<br><a name="3">3</a>  They have sharpened their tongues like a serpent; adders' poison [is] under their lips. Selah.<br><a name="4">4</a>  Keep me, O LORD, from the hands of the wicked; preserve me from the violent man; who have purposed to overthrow my goings.<br><a name="5">5</a>  The proud have hid a snare for me, and cords; they have spread a net by the wayside; they have set gins for me. Selah.<br><a name="6">6</a>  I said unto the LORD, Thou [art] my God: hear the voice of my supplications, O LORD.<br><a name="7">7</a>  O GOD the Lord, the strength of my salvation, thou hast covered my head in the day of battle.<br><a name="8">8</a>. Grant not, O LORD, the desires of the wicked: further not his wicked device; [lest] they exalt themselves. Selah.<br><a name="9">9</a>  [As for] the head of those that compass me about, let the mischief of their own lips cover them.<br><a name="10">10</a>  Let burning coals fall upon them: let them be cast into the fire; into deep pits, that they rise not up again.<br><a name="11">11</a>  Let not an evil speaker be established in the earth: evil shall hunt the violent man to overthrow [him].<br><a name="12">12</a>  I know that the LORD will maintain the cause of the afflicted, [and] the right of the poor.<br><a name="13">13</a>  Surely the righteous shall give thanks unto thy name: the upright shall dwell in thy presence.<br><br>Go to <a href="psa141.htm#1">Psalm 141</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
