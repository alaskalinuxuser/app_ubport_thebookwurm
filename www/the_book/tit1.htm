Titus   1<br>1. Paul, a servant of God, and an apostle of Jesus Christ, according to the faith of God's elect, and the acknowledging of the truth which is after godliness;<br><a name="2">2</a>  In hope of eternal life, which God, that cannot lie, promised before the world began;<br><a name="3">3</a>  But hath in due times manifested his word through preaching, which is committed unto me according to the commandment of God our Saviour;<br><a name="4">4</a>  To Titus, [mine] own son after the common faith: Grace, mercy, [and] peace, from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ our Saviour.<br><a name="5">5</a>. For this cause left I thee in Crete, that thou shouldest set in order the things that are wanting, and ordain elders in every city, as I had appointed thee:<br><a name="6">6</a>. If any be blameless, the husband of one wife, having faithful children not accused of riot or unruly.<br><a name="7">7</a>  For a bishop must be blameless, as the steward of God; not selfwilled, not soon angry, not given to wine, no striker, not given to filthy lucre;<br><a name="8">8</a>  But a lover of hospitality, a lover of good men, sober, just, holy, temperate;<br><a name="9">9</a>  Holding fast the faithful word as he hath been taught, that he may be able by sound doctrine both to exhort and to convince the gainsayers.<br><a name="10">10</a>  For there are many unruly and vain talkers and deceivers, specially they of the circumcision:<br><a name="11">11</a>  Whose mouths must be stopped, who subvert whole houses, teaching things which they ought not, for filthy lucre's sake.<br><a name="12">12</a>  One of themselves, [even] a prophet of their own, said, The Cretians [are] alway liars, evil beasts, slow bellies.<br><a name="13">13</a>  This witness is true. Wherefore rebuke them sharply, that they may be sound in the faith;<br><a name="14">14</a>  Not giving heed to Jewish fables, and commandments of men, that turn from the truth.<br><a name="15">15</a>  Unto the pure all things [are] pure: but unto them that are defiled and unbelieving [is] nothing pure; but even their mind and conscience is defiled.<br><a name="16">16</a>  They profess that they know God; but in works they deny [him], being abominable, and disobedient, and unto every good work reprobate.<br><br>Go to <a href="tit2.htm#1">Titus 2</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
