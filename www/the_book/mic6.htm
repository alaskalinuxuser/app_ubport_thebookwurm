Micah   6<br>1. Hear ye now what the LORD saith; Arise, contend thou before the mountains, and let the hills hear thy voice.<br><a name="2">2</a>  Hear ye, O mountains, the LORD'S controversy, and ye strong foundations of the earth: for the LORD hath a controversy with his people, and he will plead with Israel.<br><a name="3">3</a>  O my people, what have I done unto thee? and wherein have I wearied thee? testify against me.<br><a name="4">4</a>  For I brought thee up out of the land of Egypt, and redeemed thee out of the house of servants; and I sent before thee Moses, Aaron, and Miriam.<br><a name="5">5</a>  O my people, remember now what Balak king of Moab consulted, and what Balaam the son of Beor answered him from Shittim unto Gilgal; that ye may know the righteousness of the LORD.<br><a name="6">6</a>. Wherewith shall I come before the LORD, [and] bow myself before the high God? shall I come before him with burnt offerings, with calves of a year old?<br><a name="7">7</a>  Will the LORD be pleased with thousands of rams, [or] with ten thousands of rivers of oil? shall I give my firstborn [for] my transgression, the fruit of my body [for] the sin of my soul?<br><a name="8">8</a>  He hath shewed thee, O man, what [is] good; and what doth the LORD require of thee, but to do justly, and to love mercy, and to walk humbly with thy God?<br><a name="9">9</a>. The LORD'S voice crieth unto the city, and [the man of] wisdom shall see thy name: hear ye the rod, and who hath appointed it.<br><a name="10">10</a>  Are there yet the treasures of wickedness in the house of the wicked, and the scant measure [that is] abominable?<br><a name="11">11</a>  Shall I count [them] pure with the wicked balances, and with the bag of deceitful weights?<br><a name="12">12</a>  For the rich men thereof are full of violence, and the inhabitants thereof have spoken lies, and their tongue [is] deceitful in their mouth.<br><a name="13">13</a>  Therefore also will I make [thee] sick in smiting thee, in making [thee] desolate because of thy sins.<br><a name="14">14</a>  Thou shalt eat, but not be satisfied; and thy casting down [shall be] in the midst of thee; and thou shalt take hold, but shalt not deliver; and [that] which thou deliverest will I give up to the sword.<br><a name="15">15</a>  Thou shalt sow, but thou shalt not reap; thou shalt tread the olives, but thou shalt not anoint thee with oil; and sweet wine, but shalt not drink wine.<br><a name="16">16</a>  For the statutes of Omri are kept, and all the works of the house of Ahab, and ye walk in their counsels; that I should make thee a desolation, and the inhabitants thereof an hissing: therefore ye shall bear the reproach of my people.<br><br>Go to <a href="mic7.htm#1">Micah 7</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
