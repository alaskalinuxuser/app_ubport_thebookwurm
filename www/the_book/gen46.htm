And he sent Judah before him unto Joseph, to direct his face unto Goshen; and they came into the land of Goshen.<br><a name="29">29</a>  And Joseph made ready his chariot, and went up to meet Israel his father, to Goshen, and presented himself unto him; and he fell on his neck, and wept on his neck a good while.<br><a name="30">30</a>  And Israel said unto Joseph, Now let me die, since I have seen thy face, because thou [art] yet alive.<br><a name="31">31</a>  And Joseph said unto his brethren, and unto his father's house, I will go up, and shew Pharaoh, and say unto him, My brethren, and my father's house, which [were] in the land of Canaan, are come unto me;<br><a name="32">32</a>  And the men [are] shepherds, for their trade hath been to feed cattle; and they have brought their flocks, and their herds, and all that they have.<br><a name="33">33</a>  And it shall come to pass, when Pharaoh shall call you, and shall say, What [is] your occupation?<br><a name="34">34</a>  That ye shall say, Thy servants' trade hath been about cattle from our youth even until now, both we, [and] also our fathers: that ye may dwell in the land of Goshen; for every shepherd [is] an abomination unto the Egyptians.<br><br>Go to <a href="gen47.htm#1">Genesis 47</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
