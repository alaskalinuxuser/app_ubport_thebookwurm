Proverbs   2<br>1. My son, if thou wilt receive my words, and hide my commandments with thee;<br><a name="2">2</a>  So that thou incline thine ear unto wisdom, [and] apply thine heart to understanding;<br><a name="3">3</a>  Yea, if thou criest after knowledge, [and] liftest up thy voice for understanding;<br><a name="4">4</a>  If thou seekest her as silver, and searchest for her as [for] hid treasures;<br><a name="5">5</a>  Then shalt thou understand the fear of the LORD, and find the knowledge of God.<br><a name="6">6</a>  For the LORD giveth wisdom: out of his mouth [cometh] knowledge and understanding.<br><a name="7">7</a>  He layeth up sound wisdom for the righteous: [he is] a buckler to them that walk uprightly.<br><a name="8">8</a>  He keepeth the paths of judgment, and preserveth the way of his saints.<br><a name="9">9</a>  Then shalt thou understand righteousness, and judgment, and equity; [yea], every good path.<br><a name="10">10</a>. When wisdom entereth into thine heart, and knowledge is pleasant unto thy soul;<br><a name="11">11</a>  Discretion shall preserve thee, understanding shall keep thee:<br><a name="12">12</a>  To deliver thee from the way of the evil [man], from the man that speaketh froward things;<br><a name="13">13</a>  Who leave the paths of uprightness, to walk in the ways of darkness;<br><a name="14">14</a>  Who rejoice to do evil, [and] delight in the frowardness of the wicked;<br><a name="15">15</a>  Whose ways [are] crooked, and [they] froward in their paths:<br><a name="16">16</a>  To deliver thee from the strange woman, [even] from the stranger [which] flattereth with her words;<br><a name="17">17</a>  Which forsaketh the guide of her youth, and forgetteth the covenant of her God.<br><a name="18">18</a>  For her house inclineth unto death, and her paths unto the dead.<br><a name="19">19</a>  None that go unto her return again, neither take they hold of the paths of life.<br><a name="20">20</a>  That thou mayest walk in the way of good [men], and keep the paths of the righteous.<br><a name="21">21</a>  For the upright shall dwell in the land, and the perfect shall remain in it.<br><a name="22">22</a>  But the wicked shall be cut off from the earth, and the transgressors shall be rooted out of it.<br><br>Go to <a href="pro3.htm#1">Proverbs 3</a><hr width=60% align=center size=1>
